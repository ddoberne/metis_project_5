1,"Prologue: Birth of a Holy Knight
"
2,"At the heart of the continent of Jugdral lies Grannvale, a kingdom founded by Saint Heim of the Twelve Crusaders. Supporting the royal family, the heirs of Heim, are six noble houses, each also descended from a Crusader of old. The six states, while still subservient to the royal family, each occupy vast swaths of Grannvale's land and maintain mighty militaries of their own. Owing to King Azmur's advanced age, the governance of Grannvale falls to his son, the highly respected Prince Kurth. Kurth has two trusted advisors in his rule: Lord Byron of House Chalphy, and Lord Ring of House Yugvi. Grannvale's chancellor, Lord Reptor of Friege, has long objected to the thread to his influence posed by Kurth and his advisors, and has allied himself with the avaricious Lord Lombard of House Dozel to form a faction opposed to Kurth's rule over Grannvale. The young duke of House Velthomer, Lord Arvis, leads the Royal Guard in the king's care and so has little time for the circus of politics. Only Father Claud of House Edda, could foresee the oncoming storm. Into the midst of this tense situation, comes dire news from Jugdral's east. Darna, a town in the Aed Desert with deep ties to Grannvale, is now besieged by savage warriors from Isaach. Reports of a brutal massacre abound. The news is met by the people of Grannvale with furious cries for retribution, and before long the kingdom declares war on Isaach. Prince Kurth leads Grannvale's charge on his father's behalf, commanding the military might of the kingdom's six houses. At Kurth's side as always is none other than Lord Byron, a highly decorated hero of peerless valor in his own right. Grannvale has poured its entire military might into the Isaach campaign, and precious few soldiers remain behind. With its neighbors - Agustria to the west and Verdane to the south - bound in alliance with Grannvale, none dare to dream they could ever be threatened. It is not long at all, however, before the people's confidence is shattered. As if from nowhere, a vast horde from Verdane led by Prince Munnir crosses the Grannvale border and lays siege to Yugvi Castle. In Lord Ring's absence, his daughter, Lady Edain, is Yugvi's only guardian. Lord Byron has entrusted the defense of Grannvale in his absence to his son, Sigurd, who remains at Chalphy Castle with a mere handful of soldiers. A friend of Edain since childhood, Sigurd is horrified to hear of the Yugvi siege, and even with so few soldiers, is determined to protect Edain and his fatherland from the savage Verdanite hordes. The year is 757, Grann calendar. And thus the threshold of fate is cast open. Nobody could have known then that this simple disturbance was but the first of countless calamities to come.

4,"Midir: Milady, the castle is completely surrounded! We've failed you... We couldn't do a thing to save you from them..."
5,"Edain: It's alright, Midir. ...Every one of you did the best you could do. Please, you needn't worry about me. You must ensure that as many of you survive this as possible."
6,"Midir: No, milady. We might not stand a chance, but every last one of us will give our lives to protect you, right to the very end."
7,"Edain: Thank you, Midir. ...I'm so sorry."
8,"Sigurd: Munnir's army already has Yugvi surrounded. Edain is in grave danger! Naoise, I'm going to help her. I'm leaving Chalphy in your hands."
9,"Naoise: Hold, milord. Surely you don't intend to go alone?"
10,"Sigurd: Nearly all of our forces are already on the march to Isaach with Father. There's hardly anybody left to call upon. They may be simple savages, but Verdane's army is still huge. I can't risk your lives by forcing you to face them."
11,"Naoise: Perish the thought, milord! I was born a knight, and I will gladly risk dying a knight's death in your name. To allow our lord to die alone in battle would be an unspeakable disgrace. We shall be by your side, every step of the way. Alec, I trust you're of the same mind?"
12,"Alec: Yeah, of course! But there's more than just Yugvi at stake. We've got to stop by the nearby villages first. Those thugs'll try to beat us to them, and they'll loot, massacre, and burn them all down if they do. We've gotta get there first, and lend the locals a hand in locking the villages down and fortifying their defenses."
13,"Sigurd: Absolutely. We mustn't neglect our knightly duties to the people, especially not at a time like this. Good point, Alec."
14,"Alec: Actually, that was all Oifey's idea. That kid's every bit the tactician they say he is. Give him a few years and he'll be a match for his old grandpa, Lord Sesar!"
15,"Sigurd: Oifey's still around the castle, huh... Oifey! I know you're here. You can come out now!"
16,"Oifey: My apologies for still being here, sire. Still, if you would allow it, I'd like to join you in battle. I can't just sit back while you risk your lives."
17,Sigurd: I don't know... You're still so young. Are you sure you're ready for this?
18,"Oifey: I'm already fourteen, sire. I may not be battle-ready just yet, but there's still so much I can do to support you. Please, allow me to accompany you. I swear I won't let you down."
19,"Sigurd: Fair enough, Oifey. After all, you've already spent two years training as my squire. Real battlefield experience would be fantastic for your training, but you're still definitely not up to actual combat duty for now. How about you ride with me as my advisor instead?"
20,"Oifey: Y-yes! Thank you, sire! Thank you!"
21,"Naoise: Milord, what of the the defense of Chalphy itself in our absence? Leaving the castle unattended is risky. Should the enemy slip past us, an unguarded castle will fall easily and spell us a swift end."
22,"Alec: Naoise, I'd say there's only one man who we can depend upon for that... Eh, Arden?"
23,"Arden: Hold on a moment! why me, Alec?"
24,"Alec: Sturdy as a brick wall! Strong as an ox! Slow as a turtle! Face it, Arden, you were born for guard duty! Haha!"
25,"Arden: Pah... I'm strong and tough, I know, but you really don't need to call me slow!"
26,"Sigurd: He has a point, Arden. Would you? You're the most apt at guard duty."
27,"Arden: Sigh... Fine, I'll do it. But you have to bring me with you at least once! I don't want to be left out of the action."
28,"Sigurd: Right, men, it's time to set out. Let's start by assisting the villages, and then it's onward to Yugvi!"
29,"Munnir: You curs seriously haven't seized this puny castle yet? Useless, the lot of you... Outta my way! I'll do it myself!"
30,"Munnir: Kehehe... You! Not bad for being here all on your lonesome, but I've had enough of your struggling!"
31,"Midir: Urgh... Milady, I... Forgive me..."
32,"Edain: Ah! Midir, I..."
33,"Munnir: Well, well, looks like we have quite the gem here, and Yugvi's princess to boot! You're coming home with me, dearie. Listen up, Dimaggio. I'm heading back. You and Gerrard are in charge."
34,"DiMaggio: Er, yes, sir..."
35,"Munnir: Hah, relax! Won't be long, and I'll be bringing Cimbaeth's lot along for the fun. When I do, all Grannvale's our oyster. Even Belhalla ought to be easy pickings, what with nobody around to stop us! The kingdom's all ours, boys!"
36,"DiMaggio: Leave it to us, sir!"
37,"Munnir: Oi, quit your dawdling! We don't have all day, y'know!"
38,Edain: ...
39,Munnir: Cut the bridge! I'll have none of those Grannvale worms crossing over here!
40,"Barbarian: Yes, sir."
41,"Munnir: Oi, Gerrard. I'm going back to Marpha for now. You're in charge of the border. Stay sharp, we clear?"
42,"Gerrard: Yes, sir. But, er, your lordship... Who's that there dame you have?"
43,"Munnir: The spoils of war, m'boy! She's coming back to Marpha to marry me. Whaddya think? A real keeper, eh?"
44,Gerrard: I'll say! Just looking at her's makin' me mouth water.
45,"Munnir: Back off! This one's mine. You'll have your pick of all Grannvale once we're done here. Keep it in your pants a little longer, yeah?"
46,"Edain: What animals... ...Gods above, I implore you, bestow upon these men a hint of human decency..."
47,"Munnir: Oi, what're you mumbling about now? We're outta here. No dawdling, y'hear?"
48,"DiMaggio: Get to work, boys! Our next stop's Chalphy. Don't forget to milk the villages for all they got!"
49,"Azelle: It looks like we made it just in time, Lex."
50,"Lex: Mm. And by the look of it, Sigurd's staring down the entire Verdane army with just a handful of men! Bet he'll be glad for the help! But geez, Azelle, I can't believe I let you drag me into yet another mess like this."
51,"Azelle: With the war in Isaach going on, there's hardly anyone left to defend Grannvale. Sigurd's few knights are all we have, and they're out here risking their lives on behalf of the entire country. I couldn't just leave them to die..."
52,"Lex: Heh... We both know there's more to it than that. Come on, Azelle. What's the real reason we're here?"
53,Azelle: Er... I... I have no idea what you mean!
54,"Lex: It's that Lady Edain of Yugvi, isn't it? Come on, everybody knows you like her. You just came for her sake, didn't you?"
55,"Azelle: N-no! Of course not, you dolt!"
56,Lex: Really? Then why's your face beet-red? Looks like somebody's got a giiiiiiirlfriend!
57,"Azelle: L-Lex, knock it off! Come on, we've wasted enough time."
58,"Lex: Hahaha, got it. Time to teach these Verdanite thugs a lesson or two!"
59,"Quan: Good, we aren't too late. I pray Sigurd is still unhurt."
60,"Ethlyn: Mm. I'm sure my brother's doing just fine out here, but it won't be easy without a magic user in his ranks. I want to do all I can as a healer to help out and save lives... Quan, I'm sorry I dragged you into this mess as well... I know Chalphy isn't my family anymore, now that we're married, but I couldn't just sit back and do nothing. Thank you so much for coming. Not just from me, but from Sigurd."
61,"Quan: There's no need for thanks, Ethlyn. Sigurd is every bit as important to me as he is you, remember? He is my brother-in-law now, after all. ...And I couldn't possibly leave you to fight all alone."
62,"Ethlyn: Thank you, dear... Thank you so much..."
63,"Finn: Milord, milady, we should hurry. Lord Sigurd still awaits us on the battlefield just ahead."
64,"Oifey: Sire, might I recommend stopping by the castle town once you're rested? To see you unharmed should help to calm and reassure your citizens."
65,"Oifey: Sire, there's a young knight collapsed over there!"
66,"Sigurd: Oh? ...That's Midir! Midir, hold on! What happened here?"
67,Midir: Uh... You... ...Lord... Sigurd?
68,"Sigurd: Are you alright, Midir? Where's Edain?!"
69,Midir: I... don't know. But Munnir...
70,"Sigurd: Munnir... That's all I need to hear. Midir, I'll do all I can to rescue her. You stay here and rest up."
71,"Midir: I can't, sir. I've got to help! I can't stand staying here, knowing those thugs still have her!"
72,"Gerrard: DiMaggio stuffed up, huh? Shoulda known he was worthless! Prince Munnir's not gonna like this. Put the bridge back up, boys! We ain't gonna blow it like DiMaggio!"
73,"Arvis: When His Majesty asked me to observe the battle, I hardly expected to see Chalphy struggle so against simple barbarians. Sigurd... So this is all you've amounted to..."
74,"Arvis: It has been too long, Master Sigurd."
75,Sigurd: Lord Arvis?! Why are you-
76,"Arvis: His Majesty is concerned, and he bade me to come and observe. He also entrusted me with this - a gift for you."
77,"Sigurd: This is... a silver sword! A gift from His Majesty? Oh, what an honor! Lord Arvis, be sure to pass my deepest gratitude for this onto the king!"
78,"Arvis: Very well. Incidentally, Sigurd, rumor has it that my brother, Azelle, is among your forces. I presume this is true?"
79,"Sigurd: Mm, sorry about that. It sounded as if he came behind your back, but I couldn't turn him away. If at all possible, would you mind if he remained with me for a while longer?"
80,"Arvis: I see... So long as you keep him safe, then. He and I may have different mothers, but Azelle is still my only brother. I'd prefer if he remained by my side, but perhaps this is how it must be... I'll entrust Azelle to you, Sigurd. Be sure that he learns from this experience."
81,"Sigurd: You can leave it to me, Lord Arvis. Once we're done here, I'll do what I can to convince him to go home."
82,"Arvis: Good to hear it. Now, I must return to His Majesty's side in the capital. I'm entrusting this crisis to you, Sigurd."
83,"Sigurd: Oh, gods... Azelle... He..."
84,"Arvis: He's dead, isn't he?"
85,"Sigurd: I'm so sorry, Lord Arvis... I couldn't do a thing to save him..."
86,"Arvis: Oh, Azelle... You careless fool..."
87,"Oifey: Sire, we've completed our search of the castle. Lady Edain is nowhere to be found."
88,Sigurd: Blast... Where could she be?
89,Oifey: She was most likely taken deeper into Verdane before we arrived. ...I hope she's alright.
90,"Sigurd: Gah... I won't let them get away with this... They can run, but until they surrender Edain, they won't escape me!"
91,"Oifey: Sire, an envoy from His Majesty is seeking an audience with you."
92,"Filat: Lord Sigurd, you performance in this battle was outstanding. His Majesty is highly pleased, and has thus proclaimed your ordination as a holy knight of the realm."
93,"Sigurd: I hardly deserve such an honor, sir! I pledge my undying fealty to His Majesty."
94,"Filat: From here, it is imperative that you hold Evans. We can ill afford to lose such a valuable defensive point to the enemy. You and your men shall be handsomely paid for your service. Provided, of course, that our territory survives unscathed. Best of luck, Lord Sigurd. Grannvale expects every man to do his duty."
95,"Man: Oh, thank the gods! We're saved! We can't thank you enough! Here - the whole village did their bit to raise some money for you. It's not much, but we hope it helps out there. Be sure to lend the other villagers a hand, too. I bet they'll be happy to help you our right back."
96,"Old man: Pay attention, kid! Weapons aren't created equal. See, swords best axes, axes best lances, and lances best swords. This right here's why you've gotta use your head before you blunder into battle. Speaking of battle, if you ever find yourself hurting out there, a chapel is the best place to go. It ain't free, mind. Every bit of health you regain there'll cost five gold pieces. But you can't put a price on your health."
97,"Woman: The lords of this land, House Chalphy, have been revered as most magnificent swordsmen for generations. It's no wonder, being that they bear the bloodline of Baldr, the god of light of old. Those Verdane thugs are lucky Lord Byron isn't around with his holy sword, Tyrfing. They wouldn't stand a chance!"
98,"Old woman: Oh? You came to save us? I was so sure this was the end! Take this little trinket. It's the least I can do. They call it a speed ring. Slip this magic band on and you'll be as nimble as a feather! Go on, try her out! Your enemies'll be too slow to hit you!"
99,Azelle: Lord Sigurd! I'm so relieved to see you're unharmed.
100,Sigurd: Azelle? Azelle of Velthomer? What are you doing here?
101,"Azelle: I'm here with Lex. We want to do whatever we can to fight the Verdanite invasion. Please, allow us to fight by your side. We won't let you down!"
102,"Sigurd: Of course! I couldn't ask for better help. But what of your brother, Lord Arvis? Is he alright with you helping out?"
103,Azelle: No... He's been tasked with command of the Royal Guard. He made it clear that I wasn't supposed to leave Belhalla at all.
104,"Sigurd:' Did he, now? I can only imagine the scolding that you'll be in for later!"
105,"Azelle: I know this is a dreadful thing to say, but to be honest, I'm terrified of Arvis... Sometimes, when I'm around him, I... I feel as if I'm only a nuisance to him."
106,"Sigurd: Is that right... Well, whatever your reasons, I'm just glad that you're here, Azelle. You're more than welcome to stay for as long as you want."
107,"Azelle: Thank you, sir!"
108,"Azelle: Wow, he's just like all the rumors say! He's nothing like Arvis..."
109,"Lex: It's been a while, huh, Lord Sigurd?"
110,Sigurd: Lex! I take it you're here to help as well?
111,"Lex: Yeah, Azelle dragged me into it. I swear, I can't say no to that twerp!"
112,"Sigurd: Hahaha... You haven't changed a bit, have you, Lex? But what about your father, Lord Lombard? Does he know you've come here?"
113,"Lex: Oh, hell no! You know as well as I how much my father loathes yours. There's no way he'd ever let me help House Chalphy, even if his life depended on it. I had to slip out behind his back. Just so we're clear, Sigurd, I'm not here for you. Azelle's my best friend, and he really wanted to help. That's all."
114,"Sigurd: Heh. A bit harsh, but thanks for coming all the same. Any help is greatly appreciated."
115,"Lex: Well, I'll do what I can. Those Verdane dogs have had their run of our land for long enough!"
116,"Ethlyn: Sigurd! Oh, you're unharmed!"
117,"Sigurd: It's great to see you, too, Ethlyn. Thanks so much for coming."
118,Ethlyn: I just couldn't stay away when I heard of Verdane's attacks... It's such a relief to know you're okay.
119,"Sigurd: Oh, come now. Did you really think I was about to lose to Verdane?"
120,"Ethlyn: I'd heard that Chalphy barely has any soldiers left behind, given that most of the army is away in Isaach. And let's face it, I can't remember the last time you didn't just leap straight into a crisis without thinking. With father away at war... I knew I had to come. Someone has to save you from yourself, after all."
121,"Sigurd: Heh heh. Wow, it feels as if I was getting this very lecture only yesterday! I swear, after Mother passed away, it was you who single-handedly kept us in check. Once you went off to marry Quan, we could've sworn that Father finally had a proper little lady for a daughter... But no, nothing's changed at all! I feel so sorry for Quan... Ahahaha!"
122,"Ethlyn: Sigurd, I'm only what you and Father made me! If I'm a fusspot, then it's squarely your fault! Perhaps if the two of you hadn't been so unkempt..."
123,"Sigurd: Heh, perhaps you're right. Listen, Ethlyn... We might not act like it, but everything you've done means the world to us. I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've always caused you... And thank you so much for coming."
124,Ethlyn: Sigurd...
125,Quan: Sigurd! Glad to see you in one piece.
126,Sigurd: Quan? What are you-
127,Quan: We heard about the Verdane attack and couldn't just leave you be. We're here to do what we can.
128,"Sigurd: But what about Leonster? Aren't your hands full there, keeping an eye on Thracia?"
129,"Quan: Indeed. That's why Finn is the only knight here with me. The Lanceritter are all back at home, under Father's command."
130,"Sigurd: Is that so... Quan, I'm sorry for pulling you into this mess, too. I know you're-"
131,"Quan: Sorry? Surely you jest, Sigurd? Don't you recall our old pledge?"
132,Sigurd: Hm?
133,"Quan: Come now! How could you forget? All those years ago, when we were students at the Belhalla academy? You, me, and Eldigan. Dear friends and fierce rivals in equal measure? Surely you recall that night, talking late about our hopes and dreams, and pledging our aid to one another in times of need?"
134,"Sigurd: Ah, of course! I remember it well."
135,"Quan: Excellent. Now shall we? With both of us here, what hope could those Verdanite savages possibly have? Never forget, Sigurd. I'm here for you, now and forever. I'll not let you lose to these lowlives!"

138,"Sigurd's capture of Evans Castle comes too late. Edain is not there, instead already well within Verdane's borders. Verdane's territory is blanketed in a thick sweep of forest. The nation is widely dubbed a ""barbarian kingdom"" by Grannvale's people, owing to their constant raids on Grannvalian soil. However, the reign of King Batu has seen an end to Verdane's infamous border raids. A pacifist, King Batu has long worked to build a lasting peace with Grannvale, while also keeping his aggressive sons appeased. Ultimately, however, it was Batu himself who violated the peace he held so dear. Batu's three sons have unexpectedly launched an assault on Grannvale. Cimbaeth, the second son, lord of Genoa ... Munnir, the eldest, lord of Marpha... And Jamke, the youngest of the three. Lurking deep within Verdane territory, the three now await the arrival of Sigurd. Edain's fate... Batu's sudden belligerence... Sprawling before Sigurd lie the great forests of Verdane - and within them, the answers he seeks. He prepares to take his first steps into the spirit forest of folklore...

"
156,"Eldigan: You're doing a fine job, soldier. I leave the border's defenses to you."
157,"Cavalier: Yes, milord!"
158,"Eldigan: Sigurd! It's been a long time. Pray tell, why do I find you suddenly occupying Evans? You couldn't possibly be declaring war on Verdane, could you?"
159,Sigurd: Eldigan! Am I glad to see you. Listen. The Verdanites have abducted Lady Edain of Yugvi. They've made it amply clear that they don't plan on releasing her. Taking her back by force is our only option.
160,"Eldigan: Ah, I see. That makes sense. Well, whatever you do, you cannot afford to leave Evans unattended. My fellow Agustrian lords have been of a rancorous sort of late... Ah, I know. I'll ensure they don't threaten you from behind."
161,"Sigurd: I'm sorry to involve you in this as well. Say, Eldigan, once I'm done here, what do you say to a catch up? You, me, a fine bottle of wine... Just like old times."
162,"Eldigan: Mm. I'm looking forward to it. I trust I'll see you later, then. May luck be with you this day, Sigurd!"
163,"Cimbaeth: Listen up, Ayra! You know the deal. While I'm out, you guard the palace, right up to your very last breath. Remember, first sign of funny business, and it's the brat's head."
164,"Shannan: Ayra! Ayra, I'll be alright! Don't give in to these thugs! Don't let 'em boss you around!"
165,"Ayra: Shannan... Look, Cimbaeth, you have my word. So long as you leave Shannan alone, you'll have no trouble. But I do wonder if, once this battle is over, you actually plan to return him to me."
166,"Cimbaeth: Ahahahaha! You got nothing to worry about. If we get Evans back, you get him back."
167,"Ayra: I understand. But be warned, Cimbaeth: if you break your promise, you'll deeply regret it. Cross me, and I will pursue you to the very depths of the inferno itself, till I take your head. Remember this well!"
168,"Cimbaeth: Wh-whoa, settle down there! I don't believe it... Such a cute face, but you only use it to spew bile like that! I'm not about to make an enemy outta someone with a sword arm as fine as yours. I can promise you that."
169,"Ayra: Shannan, sit tight. Be patient for just a bit longer."
170,"Shannan: Ayra, no! Don't do it! Don't go! AYRA!!"
171,"Cimbaeth: Feh... Right, boys, we're moving out! We're taking back Evans!"
172,"Jamke: Come on, Edain! Take the brat and get out of here, and quickly! You need to get as far away as you can before Munnir finds out!"
173,"Edain: Pardon me, Prince Jamke, but are you not joining us?"
174,"Jamke: No. I won't stand for my brothers' vile ways but I just won't betray my father, either. I'm going back to the capital. I'm going to try, one more time, to convince my father."
175,"Edain: You're right... We must do all we can to end this war as soon as possible. Prince Jamke, I would sooner not burden you alone, but you are our only hope to persuade King Batu to end this."
176,"Dew: Edaaaaain! C'mon, hurry up! We're still in serious danger here. If they catch me this time, then Munnir'll rip my tongue out for sure!"
177,"Jamke: Dew, you're a thief. You got caught in the act. Any tongue rippings you get are your own fault. If Edain hadn't insisted on letting you go too, you'd still be sitting in chains. Now, what did you promise to do?"
178,"Dew: I know, I know. I promised Edain, too. I'm washin' my hands of thievin' from now on. Can I go now?"
179,"Jamke: I'll take your word for it. Now, go already!"
180,Jamke: Edain... May we meet again.
181,"Munnir: What?! Jamke let the broad go and went scurrying back to the capital? Gah! Damn my rat of a brother! Boys! We'er taking the wench and the brat back! If they put up a fight, kill 'em if you have to!"
182,Ayra: So it's finally time... Woe be to all who cross me!
183,"Oifey: Sire, we've found this young boy in the dungeon."
184,Shannan: ...
185,Sigurd: What's the matter? Why are silent? I want to know why you were held here.
186,Shannan: You're not one of Cimbaeth's lot... Are you?
187,Sigurd: We've dealt with Cimbaeth. There's nothing to be afraid of anymore...
188,Shannan: Oh! So Ayra doesn't have to keep fighting! My Auntie Ayra was forced to fight 'cause Cimbaeth had me! Please! You've got to help her!
189,"Sigurd: That swordswoman? Huh. I thought there was something amiss about her... Very well! I'll let her know that you're safe. Now, what's your name?"
190,"Shannan: Shannan. ...I'm Shannan, the prince of Isaach..."
191,"Sigurd: Isaach's prince, you say... I can barely begin to imagine what you've been through, Shannan. For now, though, you're welcome to stay with our army. Don't worry. One day, you'll make it home. I'll do all I can to ensure that."
192,"Oifey: Pardon me, sire, but we're currently at war with Isaach. If we're going to harbor its prince, shouldn't we inform the king?"
193,"Sigurd: He's a child, Oifey. That war has nothing to do with him. I'll find a way to get him home safely, but for now, we need to look after him."
194,Oifey: Just as I thought... Lord Sigurd really is such a kind man...
195,Ayra: Genoa has fallen to Grannvale?! No! I... I must get to Shannan!
196,"Oifey: Sire, we've found this young boy in the dungeon."
197,Sigurd: Who are you? What's your name?
198,Shannan: I-I'm Shannan... Prince Shanan of Isaach... You're not one of Cimbaeth's lot... Are you?
199,"Sigurd: Isaach's prince?! ...Er, forgive me. I am Sigurd, a paladin of Grannvale. We've defeated Prince Cimbaeth. You're safe now."
200,"Shannan: Really?! Then Ayra doesn't have to fight anymore! My Aunt Ayra was forced to fight 'cause Cimbaeth had me! Come on, we've gotta tell her!"
201,Sigurd: Ayra? That swordswoman out there? ...Oh. Oh no...
202,Shannan: It... It can't be... She's dead? ...You killed Aunt Ayra?!
203,"Sigurd: I'm so sorry, Shannan... If I had known, I wouldn've done all I could to help her..."
204,Shannan: Ayra...
205,"Sigurd: Oifey, could you take care of Shannan for a while? Try to help him calm down a bit."
206,"Oifey: Pardon me, sire, but we're currently at war with Isaach. If we're going to harbor its prince, shouldn't we inform the king?"
207,"Sigurd: He's a child, Oifey. That war has nothing to do with him. I'll find a way to get him home safely, but for now, we need to look after him."
208,"Oifey: Understood, sire."
209,Oifey: Just as I thought... Lord Sigurd really is such a kind man...
210,"Sigurd: Hold, Lady Ayra! Prince Shannan is safe with us! You needn't keep fighting."
211,Ayra: What? You saved Shannan? Do you speak the truth?!
212,"Sigurd: I do. Prince Shannan told me everything: that you're the daughter of the late Isaachian king. Listen. You detest Grannvalians. You've made your hostility perfectly clear, but you can't neglect your duty to the prince. You can't afford to waste your life now, not on a battle as senseless as this."
213,"Ayra: My brother, the crown prince, entrusted Shannan to my care knowing that his death was inevitable. You're right. After all this time, I refuse to die for Verdane's sake. Until I've seen Shannan rise to the Isaachian throne, my life is not mine to forfeit to such dogs."
214,"Sigurd: I will aid you all I can, if you lower your sword. On my honor as the heir of Baldr the Crusader, I swear I will not betray you."
215,"Ayra: Very well. I'll place my trust in you, as well... Such is the way of the warriors of Isaach. For now, I pledge my blade in your service. However, this does not change that Grannvale is my foe. Beware, for if one day that includes you... I will not hesitate."
216,"Sigurd: Mm, war can be truly cruel. Ayra, Isaachian warrior... I pray that day never comes."
217,"Elliot: Tch. Does Grannvale really think it can just waltz into Verdane with such a tiny force? How adorable. Men, here's our chance. Evans is ripe for the plucking, then it's straight for the Grannvale border!"
218,Cavalier: Is that... No! That's the Heirhein army! Lord Eldigan won't like this...
219,"Eldigan: What's this? Heirhein's army is marching on Evans?! Ugh... I should've known Elliot just couldn't keep his nose out of this. Take care of the castle, Lachesis. Sigurd is in dire need of my help."
220,"Lachesis: Of course, brother. Please, do all you can to help Sir Sigurd."
221,"Eldigan: Right! Cross Knights, move out! Our foe is the Heirhein army. I don't expect a challenge, but stay alert nonetheless!"
222,"Eldigan: Elliot! Ambushing them like a common thief, are you? A cowardly act, ill befitting the honor of a knight! Withdraw immediately, or I will take action. We both know you're no match for me."
223,Elliot: What's this? Eldigan?! I should've known you would side with Grannvale!
224,"Eldigan: In doing this you are crossing not just Grannvale, nor me, but your very liege! We bow to the reverent King Imuka, who desires only peace with Grannvale. Would you truly cross His Majesty?"
225,Elliot: You fool! Only you would still seriously heed that senile old fool's word. The lords of Agustria are united against both Grannvale and any peace with them!
226,"Eldigan: Wrong, for I will not stand with you! Agustria cannot afford the crippling tolls of war, and nor can Grannvale. Our past stands as a testament to this. Learn well, Elliot: we, the nobility, know not the suffering brought by war. War cripples only the powerless, our subjects. I will not abide your lust for glory at the expense of our people!"
227,"Elliot: A pretty little speech, but that won't save you now. I knew all along: you and I were always fated to clash, Eldigan! Today, we settle this, once and for all! Men, the enemy is now House Nordion! I want Eldigan's head on a platter!"
228,Eldigan: Elliot has fled? Very well. Leave him to lick his wounds. We're done here. Withdraw!
229,"Munnir: What the hell's goin' on out there! Those of you ready for battle, move out! Don't let them near the castle!!"
230,"Deirdre: N-no! Please, let go of me!"
231,"Ruffian: Heh heh... What's the matter? C'mon, I'm just askin' for a little date."
232,"Deirdre: I need to go home, sir. I ask of you, please, pay me no mind!"
233,Ruffian: Shaddup! Keep up your yappin' and you'll regret it!
234,Sigurd: What's going on here? Let the girl go.
235,"Ruffian: What's your problem!? This ones- ...Urgh! You're not that Grannvale paladin, are you?"
236,"Sigurd: You understand the situation? Then be on your way. There are none I loath more than your kind. The girl has given you her answer. Now, leave her be and get out of my sight!"
237,"Ruffian: Yeah... Yeah, got it... My bad, missy. I was just teasin', is all. Sorry. I'll be off now..."
238,Sigurd: Are you alright?
239,"Deirdre: Y-yes... Thank you, Sir Sigurd."
240,Sigurd: Hm? You know of me?
241,"Deirdre: Yes. I met a woman named Edain not long ago in this castle, and..."
242,Sigurd: She spoke of me.
243,Deirdre: She did. I knew from the moment I laid eyes on you: You are in every way the man I had imagined...
244,Sigurd: May I... ask for your name?
245,"Deirdre: ...I'm sorry, but... ...I... I must go."
246,"Sigurd: Wait! Please, I just want to talk for a little longer--"
247,"Deirdre: ...I am truly sorry. I am glad we could meet, even once..."
248,"Sigurd: What? What do you mean? Please, wait! ...Ah."
249,"Old man: Lord Sigurd, is it? What's the matter?"
250,Sigurd: Oh... You must be the town elder! That woman who ran off just now... Do you know who she is?
251,"Old man: Ahh, of course. That woman is called Deirdre. She is a priestess of the Spirit Forest."
252,Sigurd: Deirdre... She's beautiful...
253,"Old man: Ohoho, even a refined man like you can't resist being charmed by her ilk! Could it be love at first sight? Hoho..."
254,"Sigurd: Sir, please. Don't tease me. And yet... I've never seen anybody so beautiful before. I... I need to see her again."
255,"Old man: Alas, sir, for it cannot be so. The folk of the Spirit Forest staunchly refuse to partake in the world beyond their woods. Furthermore, that girl and members of her clan are forbidden from ever liaising with men. Village lore dictates that should this ever happen, calamity would befall the world. You have no choice, sir. Resign yourself of that girl."
256,Sigurd: What superstitious nonsense! That poor girl... Deirdre... we must meet again.
257,"Jamke: Father, this is absurd! Why do you still refuse to listen to me? My brothers already have fallen, and it's only a matter of time before they come for the capital as well. The Grannvale commander, Sir Sigurd, is a good man. Please, end the war while you still can!"
258,Batu: I... allowed Munnir's raid only because I'd been told that Grannvale would surely come to invade us first. Never did I intend for a war like this.
259,"Jamke: It was that sorcerer, Sandima, who told you that, wasn't it? You, Cimbaeth, and Munnir trusted him too readily. You've all been deceived!"
260,"Sandima: Now, now, Prince Jamke. That's enough of that. Your duty as prince is to lead your men into the fray. Dawdling in a place like this would be deeply troublesome of you."
261,"Jamke: Argh! Damn you, Sandima!"
262,"Batu: That's enough, Jamke. Listen to Sandima. Go. Lead your men into the fray."
263,"Jamke: Father! ...Very well. If you won't change your mind, even now, then... I'll see this through as well. But be warned. Should I return victorious, Sandima, I'll allow you to live no longer!"
264,"Batu: Sandima... Perhaps, for all this time, you may not have been entirely forthright with me. You did assure me that Grannvale hungers to claim our land, and yet..."
265,"Sandima: Feh... And just what are you saying now? To think, I believed that your Verdanites would be of use... You truly are naught but savages. You are worthless. Completely and utterly worthless! And from now on, your army is mine to command!"
266,"Batu: What?! No, stay back! Back, I- -Guhh..."
267,Sandima: Feh... Feeble-minded old fool.
268,"Manfroy: So, you've put an end to the king, Sandima... Do you expect that the Verdanite army will still obey your command?"
269,"Sandima: Oh, Archbishop Manfroy! How long have you been here, Your Eminence? The army is of no concern at all. They need only know that the king has fallen ill."
270,"Manfroy: Hrm, I see... And what of the situation here? Does the plan progress?"
271,"Sandima: My sincerest apologies, Your Excellency. That Grannvalian... Sigurd, or something, has proven to be an unexpected obstacle to the invasion."
272,Manfroy: Hrm... And what of the search for the Loptyrian scion? Have you found Cigyun's daughter?
273,"Sandima: Er... No, not yet..."
274,"Manfroy: Imbecile! After all of the pains I have gone to, to locate the boy... The son of Cigyun is still in Belhalla, but he's worthless without the female. Listen well. Cigyun was an heir of Prince Maera, brother of an emperor of the old Loptous Empire. Cigyun alone in this era inherited the sacred blood of the dark lord. That woman broke the commandment that Maera placed upon his heirs and bore two children. Do you know what this means?"
275,"Sandima: Yes, Your Eminence. When the blood of the two heir intersects, the second coming of the dark lord, Loptous, will be upon us."
276,"Manfroy: Precisely, and so too shall we, descendants of the Loptyrian Empire, return to this world. You know as well as I, Sandima, how heavily our fates depend upon the resurrection of the dark lord. You know well our order's centuries of exile, hidden deep within the Aed Desert. You know well the abuses... The famines... How we were sustained only by dreaming of the day when the Empire will rise again. And at long last, that day is upon us."
277,"Sandima: Understood, Your Eminence. If I must surrender my life to ensure that the plan is realized, I will do it gladly!"
278,"Edain: Hold, Prince Jamke!"
279,Jamke: Edain!? What are you doing here?
280,"Edain: You said you would persuade your father, yet instead you've taken to the field yourself. What is the matter with you?"
281,"Jamke: My father is a changed man. My words can no longer reach him... ...It all started when that sorcerer, Sandima, arrived. My entire family now obeys his every word."
282,"Edain: This is why I ask... Why have you taken to the field? Please, Jamke. Join us. Let's go to Verdane together. We can reason with the king, one more time. We can put an end to this war! Lord Sigurd has no interest in invading Verdane. He fought only to rescue me. Please listen, Jamke. Please... I beg of you."
283,"Jamke: Fine... If you're willing to go so far, then I'll stain my name with treason. But it must be understood that I won't let anyone lay a finger on my father."
284,"Edain: Yes, I will promise you that. Thank you, Jamke. You truly are a good person."
285,Jamke: Edain...
286,Deirdre: Wait... Lord Sigurd...
287,Sigurd: Hm? Is that... Deirdre! Ah! So this must be your Spirit Forest. Thank the gods! For a moment I thought that I might never see you again.
288,"Deirdre: Milord, listen. The dark priest Sandima guards Castle Verdane with his wicked magic. You must go no further. You would surely be killed. Please, you mustn't go..."
289,"Sigurd: But I mustn't place my men in even greater danger, either. I have no choice but to go."
290,Deirdre: ...I see. Then I will go with you.
291,Sigurd: Excuse me?
292,"Deirdre: This is called a Silence Staff. So long as my own power is enough to pierce his magical resistances, it will seal his magic away. Trust me, milord. I'll ensure his dark spells never harm anyone ever again."
293,Sigurd: I'd never imagined that you'd have such power... But why... Why are you helping me?
294,"Deirdre: ...I tried to forget you all I could, but it was all in vain. ...I no longer know what I should do..."
295,"Sigurd: What is it you're afraid of, Deirdre? I don't understand. But if you and I feel the same way, then surely we've nothing to fear. I... I love you, Deirdre..."
296,Deirdre: Wait... Lord Sigurd...
297,Sigurd: Hm? Is that... Deirdre! Ah! So this must be your Spirit Forest. Thank the gods! For a moment I thought that I might never see you again.
298,"Deirdre: I heard of Sandima's defeat. I was afraid that he'd find me... He was a dark priest from a shadowy cult, sent to Verdane to find me."
299,Sigurd: A... shadowy cult? What in the world do you mean?
300,"Deirdre: I don't know much of it myself. All I know comes from the last words of the old woman who raised me. Somewhere in this world, she said, there lies an ancient order dedicated tot eh ancient dark god, Loptous. So devout are they, it is said that they plot to resurrect their once-fallen god."
301,"Sigurd: Yes, I've heard those rumors myself. But why is this cult after you?"
302,"Deirdre: The dark god slumbers within my very blood... Through me, they have some way of reviving Loptous. This is why she told me on her deathbed: I must never be found, she said. I must never mingle with men..."
303,Sigurd: I see... So that's why you kept running away from me.
304,"Deirdre: I was afraid of falling in love. I did all I could to forget you, but... Love found me still. I couldn't do it... I couldn't bear to lose you. I... no longer know what I should do..."
305,"Sigurd: Deirdre... I know you must fear where your destiny might lead. But nothing will come of living in fear. I will protect you. Come what may, I will protect you. Deirdre, if you and I feel the same way, then we've nothing to fear. O gods above, should our love be a sin, then deliver punishment unto me alone! I swear this day: Even should my body be rendered and rent, no regrets will ever haunt me. All I ask, O gods... Protect my beloved Deirdre in my stead, for all eternity!"
306,Deirdre: Ahh... Milord...
307,"Oifey: Sire, we've found a casualty in the palace. It's... it's King Batu himself. By the look of it, he's well beyond help."
308,"Sigurd: King Batu! Are you alright? Please, come on... you can make it!"
309,Batu: Hnnh... Lord... Sigurd? I am so sorry for doing all this to you... I let Sandima... lead me astray... He... he abused my trust... and won over my sons... all to seize control of Verdane for himself...
310,"Sigurd: I understand, Your Highness, but you need to rest now. Please, you mustn't stress yourself further."
311,"Batu: No... It's too late for me... Heed my word, Sigurd, for there is one final thing I must tell you... The misery here... the grief spreading across Jugdral... it is all the will of the dark priesthood... They blight our world from the shadows, all in the name of the revival of their dark god, Loptous... Sandima... was one of them... He twisted us to war with Grannvale... for the sake of the cult's madness. The... the dark priests... they infect every corner of our world... Sigurd... Stay vigilant, lest you be tricked too! I... I failed the people of Verdane... Sigurd, I beg you... Make this right... Protect... my... people..."
312,Sigurd: Oh... Your Highness... The dark priesthood? What in the blazes is happening...?
313,"Woman: This village is part of the holdings of Prince Cimbaeth, lord of Genoa. He's as dreadful as they come! Barely a month goes by without him settin' his army on us. It's terrifyin'! King Batu, his father, used to do such a fine job of keepin' him in check. I can hardly imagine what's goin' on... Anyway, glad you stopped by!"
314,"Woman: King Batu is as gentle as they come. Normally, at least, leading a war like this is the last thing he'd ever do. Mark my words: this is all the doing of Sandima, his sorcerous advisor. I can just feel it. Making out a living here's grown tougher and tougher since the day that man arrived, and save for the youngest son, Jamke, both king and country are at his very whim. Please, I beg you... Save our country! Bring back the Verdane that once was!"
315,"Old man: Just t'the north a here is this mighty woodland. S'called the Spirit Forest. Once upon a time, I lived there too, in this li'l hamlet deep within. Th' village is home to the last kin o' the dark one of old, Loptous. They say it all started with Saint Maera, exiled by the empire for darin' to sympathize with mortal men. In my day, there was this gorgeous girl livin' there called Cigyun, the last heir o' Loptous' bloodline, she was. She lived 'er life under close guard, the villagers wary o' lettin' the blood o' Loptous loose into th' world. Alas, Cigyun grew weary o' the tedious forest life an' she left it all behind, breaking ancient commandments. A couple o' years later, she came back, 'cept now she was pregnant. Never said who the father was, mind. Before long Cigyun died, even as she gave birth t' her daughter. From what I 'eard, the hamlet's old prophet took 'er in and raised the girl as 'er own. If the little girl's still alive, she'd 'ave to be 'bout seventeen or eighteen by now..."
316,"Lex: Ugh, dammit! I dropped my axe!"
317,"Woman: What you dropped... Was it this golden axe? Or perhaps, this silver axe?"
318,"Lex: Oh, no. My axe isn't anything as fine as those two. It's just a plain old iron axe."
319,"Woman: Such an honest person... As a reward... I present you with this brave axe... Farewell, Lord Lex..."
320,Lex: Er...
321,"Cavalier: Rest assured, Nordion has this region covered. Leave this point to us."
322,"Quan: Finn, this will likely be a very long battle. My apologies for bringing you into it."
323,"Finn: I am but your humble servant, milord. I would go anywhere, should my master will it."
324,"Quan: Thank you, Finn."
325,"Finn: Even so, I am but a page... It honors me to have your confidence, but I doubt I'll be of much use to you."
326,"Quan: Is that so? In that case, what better time than now is there for a spot of hands-on training? Draw, Finn!"
327,"Finn: Yes, sir!"
328,Sigurd: Edain? Thank goodness you're okay!
329,"Edain: Lord Sigurd! So you came to my aid, did you? Please accept my apologies. I've put the people of Chalphy through nothing but danger..."
330,"Sigurd: Don't worry about it. Everyone will be glad to know that you're safe. You've nothing to worry about anymore. The road back to Yugvi is secure for you, when you're ready."
331,"Edain: No, I wish to remain here. Injuries are inevitable in war. As a humble servant to the gods, it is my duty to stay here and aid your wounded."
332,"Sigurd: Say, Edain... As I recall, you declined to pursue a knighthood and instead joined the clergy. Am I right? I shouldn't be surprised, knowing how easily people warm to you, and you them. I'd do well to learn from your example!"
333,"Edain: Thank you, Lord Sigurd, but that isn't entirely true. Initially, I sought priesthood in a bid to help me find my sister. Even now, I still believe this is the answer I seek."
334,"Sigurd: You mean Brigid... I'd heard that she went missing as a child. So all this time, Edain, you've been praying for her sake, haven't you?"
335,"Edain: Yes. I know we'll meet someday. No matter what happens, I must give her this: her sacred birthright, the bow Yewfelle!"
336,"Midir: Milady? You... you're safe! Ahh... thank the gods! I'm so sorry I failed to protect you. Please, forgive me..."
337,"Edain: The important part is that you're safe as well, Midir. Please, don't worry about it. You gave your all to protect me, and I couldn't thank you enough for that, even if you didn't succeed. For now I'd like you to remain with Sigurd. He could use your strength."
338,"Midir: Certainly, milady. He's done so much for me, for you, and for all of Yugvi. I'll do all I can to return his kindness."
339,"Azelle: Ah, Lady Edain! You're safe... thank the gods..."
340,Edain: Lord Azelle? Have you been fighting for Yugvi as well?
341,"Azelle: When the news of your abduction reached us, the thought of you in danger while I just sat at home was unbearable! I came to Yugvi as quickly as I could."
342,"Edain: Hold on. You are the younger brother of Lord Arvis of Velthomer, are you not? Did he allow you to come?"
343,"Azelle: No, I... I came without his consent. And he certainly won't be pleased."
344,"Edain: Why would you do something so reckless, then? I thought you abhorred violence."
345,"Azelle: Because I... er, well..."
346,"Edain: Oh? What is it, Azelle?"
347,Azelle: It's... It's nothing... never mind.
348,"Ethlyn: Edain, are you okay? When I heard you'd been abducted, I was so worried!"
349,"Edain: You came to fight for me as well, Ethlyn? Thank you... I'm sorry for your trouble. It's difficult to convey my thanks, but please, accept this staff. I think you'll have more use for it than me."
350,"Ethlyn: Is this... a Return staff?! Oh, thank you, Edain! I'll put it to good use to help us all."
351,"Quan: Princess Ayra of Isaach, I presume? I heard your story from Sigurd. I am Quan of Leonster."
352,Ayra: A pleasure.
353,"Quan: I'd hate to press you for information so soon, but there's something I'd like to know. Why did Isaach attack Darna in the first place? Surely you knew doing so would invoke the wrath of Grannvale. That King Mananan would commit such a reckless act... The very idea defies belief."
354,"Ayra: You knew my father, Sir Quan?!"
355,"Quan: I'm afraid I never had the chance to meet him. However, my father knows him well. He always had only the utmost praise for him. He also speaks fondly of your brother, Prince Mariccle. He's always said he is a fine young man."
356,"Ayra: Is that so? It heartens me to hear it. Without a doubt, my father and Mariccle were admirable men. Never would they condone such an assault on a defenseless city. In the matter of Darna, the patriarch of Rivough acted alone and without our consent..."
357,"Quan: I beg your pardon?! Why haven't the Grannvalians heard this? Surely if Prince Kurth knew the truth, he would refuse to continue the war."
358,"Ayra: So, too, thought my father. Once he executed the Rivough patriarch, he departed for the Grannvale front, head in tow, to negotiate with them. But..."
359,Quan: ...Yes?
360,"Ayra: My father, the king... He was assassinated on the way. Once word of this returned to Isaach, the people were utterly incensed. Mariccle set out, leading our entire army, seeking vengeance against Grannvale."
361,"Quan: Something is amiss here. The murder of a king who seeks peace talks certainly isn't like Prince Kurth, either. Have you told Sigurd of this as well?"
362,Ayra: No. Lord Sigurd carries enough of a burden as it is. It's too late for my brother...
363,"Quan: Prince Mariccle was resigned to his death when he engaged Grannvale, wasn't he..."
364,"Ayra: My brother believed to the last that Isaach's hope for the future rests in Shannan, his son. My role is to protect Shannan, and with him, the promise of Isaach's liberty..."
365,"Quan: I see. Thank you for telling me, Princess Ayra. Someday, the world will know this truth, and till that day comes, you mustn't give in. I will do all I can to help you."
366,"Ayra: Thank you, Sir Quan."
367,"Dew: Hey! Miss Edain! I got something good to give you. Look, I picked up this odd cane. It won't do much good if I just hold onto it, will it?"
368,"Edain: Oh? This is a Warp staff. Where did you find it, Dew?"
369,"Dew: Oh... er... I... I found it just over there! Yeah! That's right. Weird, isn't it? I betcha one of the gods left it over there. Juuuuust for you!"
370,"Edain: Oh, Dew... Having a staff like this ought to be a great help for everybody. Thank you. I'll cherish it."

372,"Chapter 2: Disturbance in Agustria 
"
373,"Verdane has fallen to Grannvale. On orders from Belhalla, Sigurd governs the region from Evans Castle, with his newly-wed wife Deirdre ever at his side. However, Grannvale's actions in Verdane are ill received by neighboring Agustria. The lords of Agustria lead a storm of heated rhetoric denouncing Grannvale. To make matters worse, the renowned pacifistic Agustrian ruler, King Imuka, has been slain by an unknown hand. Imuka's successor to the Agustrian crown is his firstborn son, Prince Chagall. Even as the Agustrian crisis unfolds, the bulk of Grannvale's army remains in Isaach. And so, Chagall has given the lords his first command as their new king: invade Verdane. As the sole defender of Grannvales front, Sigurd once again finds himself in battle...

382,"Eldigan: Enough! I'll leave three of my finest knights here to defend Nordion, should the worst come to pass. Lachesis, you needn't look so sad. I will be back. I promise. I'm not about to abandon you in death."
383,Lachesis: Eldie...
384,"Eldigan: Please, Your Majesty! Reconsider your militant ambitions. Your father before you worked so hard to build an era of peace with Grannvale. A war will only bring ruin to our people, bringing disgrace upon your good name for generations to come. I implore you: Do not start a war!"
385,"Chagall: So it's you... Eldigan of Nordion. You dastard... My father adored you, and you used his trust to undercut me at every turn. But now, my father is no more... And long live the king of all Agustria! For years you've made me play the fool, and now, I will reward you in kind. Guards! Throw this man in the dungeon!"
386,"Eldigan: W-wait! Your Majesty, please-"
387,"Chagall: Pfeh! Good riddance, the eyesore. Send my orders to Boldor at Heirhein: seize Nordion Castle! Once that nuisance is dealt with, we're clear to throw all we've got at Grannvale!"
388,"Manfroy: Your Majesty, King Chagall... I see you've made your decision at last."
389,"Chagall: Manfroy? Yes, just as we agreed. Father is dead, and by my hand. ...There is no turning back now. Even so, I still don't know if we stand a chance."
390,"Manfroy: Remember, Grannvale still adheres to that tawdry old peace treaty with you, and their entire army is distracted in Isaach. Strike now, and you could not possibly fail."
391,"Chagall: You're right. The downfall of Grannvale will mark the rise of Agustria as Jugdral's new leading power! ""Chagall, Emperor of the World""... I like the sound of that."
392,Manfroy: Hmhmhm... We can only hope your ambition will be rewarded.
393,Eve: Milady! We've received word that Lord Eldigan was arrested in Agusti!
394,Lachesis: What?! You must be joking! Oh... Why didn't I try harder... I shouldn't have let him go...
395,"Eve: That isn't our only problem, milady. With Lord Eldigan gone, we need to be aware of Heirhein's movements. Knowing of his lordships absence, a strike from them is inevitable. After the Verdane incident, they're most likely out for revenge on us... Especially Lord Elliot."
396,"Lachesis: Ugh, that Elliot... I can't believe how many times I've had to tell him I'm not interested in him. Smug, self-absorbed swine like him are the absolute worst! If only more men were cut from the same cloth as Eldie... It's too bad they aren't, else perhaps someone would stand a chance to marry me. Perhaps."
397,"Eve: Er... Be that as it may, Lord Eldigan's Cross Knights are still dispatched to the north at Sylvale Castle, well away from here. We three are all who remain. Nordion is vulnerable, and they know it. Rest assured, my brothers and I will do all we can to defend the castle, but the odds are against us. I'm sorry, milady."
398,"Lachesis: Very well. Thank you, Eve. But please, look after yourselves. Don't waste your lives for me. Be sure to tell Eva and Alva that I'm sorry for this."
399,"Eve: We are not worthy of such kind words, milady. Even so, Lord Eldigan handpicked us to protect you. Our lord gave us a task, and we will see it through. As paladins of Nordion, our lives are yours, no matter what. To our dying breaths, we live to protect you!"
400,"Boldor: Let me get this straight. Eldigan ticked off the king and got himself a little prison time for his troubles? Ahahaha, that's perfect! Elliot! Lay siege to Nordion at once! Let's see some tears roll down Eldigan's Cheeks!"
401,"Elliot: With pleasure, Father!"
402,"Oifey: Sire, we have trouble! It appears that Lord Eldgian has been taken prisoner and Nordion is under attack. I bear a message from Lady Lachesis, pleading for aid."
403,"Sigurd: They've taken Eldigan?! Why... Why in the world would they treat a man so esteemed this way? Inform everybody to make ready. We ride for Nordion at once! No matter the cost, Lachesis needs us. He might never admit it, but Lachesis has always been dear to Eldigan. The loss of Lachesis would gravely wound him..."
404,"Deirdre: Milord... You're preparing for another battle, aren't you?"
405,"Sigurd: I'm sorry, Deirdre. I owe so much to Eldigan. I could never abandon his sister in a time like this."
406,Deirdre: I thought as much. I'm not about to stop you. No... I will accompany you.
407,"Sigurd: What?! No, I can't allow that! I refuse to endanger you like this."
408,"Deirdre: Milord, do you not remember our vows? You swore to never leave my side, and... I... I am... uneasy... I have a feeling that if you and I were to part, we would never find each other again... Please, grant me this. Let me stay by your side..."
409,Sigurd: I'm sorry... you're right. I did promise. Very well! Let us ride together. But you mustn't leave my side.
410,Deirdre: I won't.
411,"Elliot: Lady Lachesis of Nordion, huh... I've been looking forward to this. She's been playing cruel games with my heart for years... But look how the tables have turned! I've an entire army behind me, against her insignificant guard. What could she possibly do? She's powerless to resist coming back to Heirhein with me! And who knows... Perhaps one day she'll admit she wants it."
412,Philip: Our task is to form a defensive line. Don't let the enemy lure you from your post. Stand your ground! Understood?
413,"Macbeth: So, Heirhein's finally made their move... Perfect. Release the brigands on the villages, as we arranged! Under the old king, you couldn't even dare to meddle in any of his property... Yet it is the easiest thing to cheat Chagall! Strip everything of worth you find and bring it back here. Leave no stone unturned!"
414,Clement: Heirhein is going for Nordion's throat? Hm... who do I side with here? Let's wait and see how this unfolds. Instruct the men to remain where they are until the dust settles.
415,"Chulainn: Hah... Heh... Nobody here's ever bested me before. Who in the world are you, anyway? The way you fought... You were brimming with spirit! Hm... I'd wager there's something you're here to fight for, right? All I've done is chase the money for all these years... But I look at you, and suddenly it all feels so meaningless. Hey, I don't suppose you're recruiting? Maybe using my blade for something real and grander then me is just what I need."
416,Lachesis: Sir Sigurd! Thank goodness you're here! Things were looking so bleak for a moment...
417,"Sigurd: I'm glad to see you're safe, Lachesis. What about Eldigan? Is he still being held?"
418,"Lachesis: Yes, he's still in Agusti... It's as if all the lords of Agustria have turned on us. Please, Sir Sigurd... Lend us your might! No matter what it takes, my brother must be saved."
419,"Sigurd: Of course. I've no fondness for bringing war to foreign lands, but in this case we've little choice. His Majesty, King Azmur, is aware of King Imuka's assassination, and of Chagall's hand in it. He's received word of Chagall's ambitions to invade Grannvale itself, and has already approved military action. His Majesty also believes Eldigan's rescue to be vital if we're to put an end to hostilities. Rest assured, Lachesis. I swear that I'll save Eldigan..."
420,"Oifey: Heirhein is secure, sire. What are you thinking for our next move? Do we pull out?"
421,"Sigurd: Hm. The imminent danger has passed. Nordion should be safe, but Eldigan is still being held in the capital. Furthermore..."
422,Oifey: Yes?
423,Sigurd: I'm hearing that the frontier towns in the central forests are grappling with bandit raids. We can't afford to leave them be.
424,"Oifey: Agreed. It is crucial that we help the locals, that we might convince them we aren't their enemy. In that case, we must ride for the north at once. There's no time to waste. Let's go!"
425,"Chagall: You imbecile! You turned your back on this crisis to line your own pockets, and now we've lost Heirhein! There had better be a good explanation for your behavior, Macbeth!"
426,"Macbeth: Er, um... My humblest apologies, Your Majesty! Forgive me, I beg of you! I've already sent out the order for Waltz's sellsword unit to move in at once."
427,"Voltz: Hrmph. There's the order to move in. Guess we don't 'ave much of a choice now. Bet he's gonna send us in, then 'ave his men turn tail right when we need 'em. I'm stayin' put till I see how this all plays out. Oi, Beowolf, how 'bout you?"
428,"Beowolf: Yeah, I ain't up for this at all, Voltz. That Macbeth swine really rubs me the wrong way. I'm this close to just walking off the job."
429,"Voltz: You're a free man, Beowolf. If a job isn't right for you, you're free to quit it. That's the funny thing about mercenaries, innit? Today's pals are tomorrow's foes."
430,"Beowolf: Amen to that. Hopefully we're not gonna end up enemies someday. Wouldn't have a hope in hell against you, would I?"
431,Voltz: Heh... Ain't met anybody in the whole world who can take me!
432,"Lewyn: What's going on, sir? What's that din outside?"
433,"Man: Well, well! The bard's still here, are you? You oughta get outta here. We've got bandits headed our way."
434,Lewyn: Bandits? Isn't the Agustrian army doing something about them?
435,"Man: The army? Hah! That's rich, boy! The army's too busy with their little civil war to deal with our problems. Clearly that's more important than our safety. Actually, that's not all... Rumor is, the Lord of Anphony himself is pullin' the bandits' strings here."
436,"Lewyn: Oh, you've gotta be kidding. That's it. That guy's gotta go. I'll go sort out the bandits, okay? Now, how big a reward'll be waiting here for me when I get back?"
437,"Man: Still full of hot air, are you? Just get outta here, wise guy. Nobody here's got the time to listen to you blowing your own horn."
438,"Lewyn: Oh, come on! A little confidence would be nice! Eh, whatever..."
439,"Silvia: Oi! Lewyn! Runnin' off behind my back now, are ya?"
440,Lewyn: Silvia?! Damn! Er... I mean... you found me!
441,"Silvia: Yeah, I found ya! You've had your fun with me, so you're just dumpin' me without so much as a goodbye?"
442,"Lewyn: Hey, careful with that tongue of yours! We barely just met here a week ago! We've only been out for dinner for... What, two or three times? You're a dancer. I'm a bard... There's not much else to it."
443,Silvia: But... But you called me adorable! That... That really meant a lot to me...
444,"Lewyn: Er... Sometimes I just say things and don't really mean them... Oh, come on! Enough with the tears! Things'll probably get more than a bit rough out there, though. Think you'll be okay?"
445,Silvia: Yeah! I like it rough!
446,Lewyn: Geez... She was crying here eyes out just a few seconds ago. It's like she never really grew up...
447,Silvia: Huh?
448,"Lewyn: Er, nothing! Let's get going."
449,"Voltz: Right, it's show time! Boys, you know the drill. Surrender ain't an option. Let's show 'em how real men fight!"
450,"Erinys: Oh, that must be Agusti Castle! I'd say we're due for a break. Hopefully we'll be able to find a lead on Prince Lewyn's whereabouts in town."
451,"Beowolf: Hey, you! If you're gonna hire me, ya need a cool 10,000 gold. What's that? Don't have it? Hit the road!"
452,"Beowolf: Hey, you! Wanna hire my blade? 10,000 gold. Take it or leave it. ...Right, deal. You ain't gonna be disappointed."
453,"Oifey: Sire, we have a visitor. Lord Filat of Belhalla seeks an audience."
454,"Sigurd: Lord Filat, I presume? Thank you for coming."
455,"Filat: Lord Sigurd, the Agustrian conflict has escalated into full-scale war, I see. How does this battle look at the moment?"
456,"Sigurd: We're faring well so far, somehow, but this hasn't been easy by any means."
457,"Filat: Incidentally, Lord Sigurd, I regret to say that I come bearing bad news..."
458,Sigurd: What happened?
459,"Filat: Nasty rumors have emerged of late in the royal court... and they concern you. The rumors claim that, in concert with Quan of Leonster and Eldigan of Nordion, you are conspiring against the crown. This, it is said, is why you are harboring the prince of Isaach in your ranks."
460,Sigurd: What?! That's absurd! Who in the world could've started such nonsense...
461,Filat: Chancellor Reptor and Lord Lombard.
462,"Sigurd: I see... I should have known, knowing their disdain for my father. Yet, to take that grudge so far..."
463,"Filat: Those two are ruled by their envy of your father's immense power as Prince Kurth's advisor, I'd say. They likely believe a Chalphy-controlled prince will strip them of their influence once he takes the throne. Fear and jealousy dominate their lives... Don't let your guard down against them."
464,"Sigurd: Thank you, sir. I appreciate the warning. By the way, sir... Pray tell, how goes the Isaachian campaign? Is there an end in sight?"
465,"Filat: It seems there is indeed, from what we've heard. We expect the triumphant return of the prince and your father any day now."
466,"Sigurd: Thank the gods Prince Kurth is safe. Losing him to this war would have dealt such a blow to Grannvale's future... I know my father worries so about how the Belhalla lineage would end with His Majesty's death, unmarried as he is."
467,"Filat: Indeed. Before the war started, we were trying to hasten him to search for a wife."
468,"Sigurd: If I may, is there a problem?"
469,"Filat: Indeed... The story behind this has been well known in the royal court for a long time now. Regrettably, His Highness struggles to move on from a long-lost love."
470,Sigurd: Really? Why did he never marry this person?
471,"Filat: Well... Perhaps I ought to tell you the complete tale. This happened some twenty years ago. Prince Kurth had an affair with the duchess of Velthomer, a truly lovely woman as I recall. Duke Victor of Velthomer was... Well, he was a philanderer of the worst degree, and had countless lovers. The prince, of course, is nothing like him. He wished only to support the duchess at first, but the two soon fell deeply in love. Victor was distraught, needless to say. He penned a letter denouncing the pair, then he took his own life. The duchess could bear to stay no longer. She fled Grannvale and was never seen again. As I recall, her name was Cigyun."
472,Sigurd: ...Wow. That's horrible... So she was the mother of Lord Arvis...
473,Filat: Indeed. I can scarcely imagine what this was like for him... Losing both parents at only the age of seven...
474,"Sigurd: Mm. And yet, I feel so sorry for the prince. Not to mention, for Cigyun as well..."
475,"Filat: Oh! My apologies. I'm sure a soldier of your caliber has better things to worry about than court gossip. Please, don't worry about the story. You have a war with Agustria to win, after all! Farewell, Lord Sigurd. We look forward to the day that you, too, return to the fatherland in triumph."
476,Clement: You can't be serious! They've come as far as Anphony?! Are they just going to keep going until all Agustria is theirs? They'll have to come this way. We've no choice but to fight. Deploy the ballistae. We're all that stands between the capital and Grannvale's dogs of war!
477,"Erinys: King Chagall, with all due respect, may we begin already? I need to find Prince Lewyn as quickly as possible. You said you know his location. That's the only reason I'm here."
478,"Chagall: Apologies for the delay, knight, but I just received word of a lead for you. I trust you've noticed we're currently contending with a Grannvale invasion? They have taken Prince Lewyn captive! My scouts report that their army is arresting and executing anyone and anything which stands in their way. Your prince is being held in Evans Castle. Reports say that he is soon to face the axe."
479,"Erinys: No... I can't allow this! Thank you for your assistance. We'll leave to rescue him at once. Our queen, Lahna, cautioned us against clashing with other nations on our mission, but we may have no choice. Should Grannvale's troops cross our way, they'll be confronted without hesitation."
480,Chagall: Oho... This is even better than I'd hoped! Best of luck on your hunt.
481,"Erinys: I'll be on my way, then."
482,Chagall: She's gone... Pah! Stupid little girl. Ready the Agusti knights to deploy! End those pigs in a single strike!
483,Lewyn: Wait... Erinys?! The hell are you doing here?
484,"Erinys: Huh? Aren't you... ...It can't be! Prince Lewyn?! ...What exactly are you wearing, milord?"
485,"Lewyn: What, this? I'm a bard now. You know, walking the land, spreading songs and cheer? What do you say: perfect, or perfect?"
486,"Erinys: Er... Perfect? But why, milord... Aren't you supposed to be held captive at Evans? I got here as fast as I could, but..."
487,"Lewyn: I'm imprisoned at Evans, am I? Where'd you hear that one?"
488,Erinys: King Chagall of Agustria said so.
489,"Lewyn: Chagall? Hah! Hate to break it to you, Erinys, but you've been tricked! It's nice and all that you're so ready to trust, but you wouldn't last ten seconds out there in the city! It'd eat you and your innocence alive. You might even end up like Silvia..."
490,"Erinys: Silvia, milord...?"
491,"Lewyn: Oh, Silvia's... Er, it's not important. Point is, what are you doing all the way out here?"
492,"Erinys: Isn't it obvious? I'm here to find and bring you home, milord. It's been two years since you fled Silesse. Her Majesty is gravely worried about you. Please, milord. Come home with me."
493,"Lewyn: Do you have any idea what that'd do to Silesse, Erinys? If I go back, I'll have no choice but to take the throne. It's my late father's will, but my uncles would never accept it. Just one false step and we'd have a civil war, just like here. And it's always the common folk who suffer for it! If there are people who want to be kings or whatever, great! Out here, though? I'm free, and I like it that way. I don't want a thing to do with that throne. For the good of Silesse, just give it to one of my uncles."
494,"Erinys: I can't allow that, milord. You know as well as I that the kings of Silesse must bear descent from Forseti, the wind god. You, milord, are the sole living scion of his lineage. Neither of your uncles bear it. You milord, are Silesse's future! Yourself and your uncles aside, all Silesse wishes to see you claim the throne. And... And your mother, the queen, was in tears when she sent me... Please, milord... Come back."
495,"Lewyn: Erinys... Ugh, don't you start crying too! Give me a break... I can't stand to see a woman in tears... Okay, fine. I'll think about going home. Just... Give me some time to muster the nerve, alright?"
496,"Erinys: Thank you. In that case, I'm staying with you until you're ready, milord. I'll send a messenger back to Silesse to report that you're safe."
497,"Lewyn: Wow, you're persistent, I'll grant you that. All right. I think I'll stay with Sigurd's army for now. He's a pretty neat guy to work with, not to mention his army's full of beauties! Hey, Erinys, you could stand to get to know some of the ladies here. Maybe their stylishness could rub off on you a bit!"
498,"Erinys: Yes, milord..."
499,"Lewyn: Hey, I'm just kidding, Erinys! Relax a bit! Don't take everything so seriously! ...Heh, nobody in the world's as sweet as you. Don't you ever change a thing."
500,"Erinys: Y-yes, sir... I mean, no, milord..."
501,"Sigurd: Good. Mackily is ours. That leaves the capital, Agusti..."
502,"Oifey: Indeed, sire, but don't get too careless. We've been informed that Agusti still hosts a sizable defensive force. We ought to take the most utmost care."
503,"Sigurd: Mm, you're right. Who knows what Chagall has up his sleeve..."
504,"Chagall: W-what?! Mackily has fallen too? Ugh... Zane! Your unit's our last line of defense. Take the field, immediately!"
505,"Zyne: Y-yes, sir, but-"
506,Chagall: Cease your whining! Get out there!
507,"Manfroy: Chagall... So quick to panic at the first sign of trouble, are we?"
508,"Chagall: Y-you! Manfroy!! If it weren't for your schemes, I wouldn't be in this mess! How in the blazes will you fix this?!"
509,"Manfroy: Heh heh... You exaggerate my role. All I did was advise the removal of the king, obstacle to your ambition as he was. All else was your choice. Can you doubt this?"
510,"Chagall: I... Damn it all! How is Sigurd's little army even this strong? This isn't fair! Manfroy, I'm begging you... Help me. What am I supposed to do now?!"
511,"Manfroy: As I said, this isn't over. As a last resort, I do believe you have a fellow of use imprisoned here... Yes, I speak of Eldigan. Eldigan and Sigurd have been associates for years. Sigurd will unquestionably listen to Eldigan's counsel. Of course, Eldigan can't do that while locked up, can he? Go apologize to him."
512,"Chagall: Er... Y-yes, of course! Surely, Eldigan is the answer! Now, if you'll excuse me..."
513,Manfroy: Ugh... what a simpleton.
514,"Dark mage: Your Excellency, I bear news from the east. Just now, I bore witness to the assassination of Prince Kurth."
515,"Manfroy: Is that so? Excellent. This grows more interesting, if I do say so myself. With Kurth's death there remains but a single scion to Naga's holy lineage, and that old fool hardly needs our help to die. And then, all that will remain is the restoration of the dark one, and then the world will belong to us..."
516,"Dark mage: What of Duke Arvis, Your Excellency? Is he in agreement with your plan?"
517,"Manfroy: Why, of course. As a bearer of the dark one's blood, what choice does he have? Not even one of Arvis' stature can afford the wider world learning of his dark heritage, lest he be burned at the stake. Could a man as prideful as Arvis bear to meet such an end?"
518,"Dark mage: So he will betray his king and style himself emperor, and..."
519,Manfroy: Indeed... But that will not be enough. Arvis alone cannot restore the dark god. We still need one more person... That woman's daughter.
520,"Zyne: Men, move out! We may die here today, but we shall die in the fatherland's name!"
521,"Eve: Milady, we three shall return to Nordion. Before we leave, however, we have something for you. This ring will help you fight more like a mounted knight. Put it on and it will allow you to keep moving after fighting or healing. I know it will prove highly useful to you. Take care, milady!"
522,"Oifey: Sire, King Chagall survived the battle, but he was badly wounded. He's currently being attended to by a royal priest."
523,"Sigurd: From what I heard, somebody pulled him from the battlefield when he was defeated. Who in the world would've done that...?"
524,"Eldigan: That was me, Sigurd. I rescued King Chagall. I preserved the life of the last survivor of the Agusti dynasty. No matter how unwise his decisions, no matter how ill his temper, I cannot sit in silence and allow my liege to die."
525,"Sigurd: Hm? Eldigan?! You're safe! Thank the gods! I've been looking everywhere for you, since I heard you'd been arrested."
526,"Eldigan: I suppose I was... But what is the meaning of this, Sigurd? Why is your army swarming the capital the first thing I find upon release? Why are reports saying our castles are now under the rule of Grannvale officers, as if we are a mere tributary state? I'm indisposed for barely any time at all, only to find Grannvale has made itself at home in Agustria behind my back! There had better be a damned good explanation for all of this, Sigurd, or there will be consequences."
527,"Sigurd: I'm so sorry, Eldigan. You're absolutely right: none of this makes sense to me, either. As if out of nowhere, the entirety of Agustria suddenly turned against us. We had no choice. I've been order to remain here with my army for the time being, to maintain peace and order. Eldigan, please. I know this is a dreadful situation, but one year is all I need. I can restore the country's peace to normal and repair our diplomatic ties, but only if I'm allowed time to do it. Once our time is through, we'll leave your country with no objections. My king and I pledge our word."
528,"Eldigan: Hm... I suppose I've little choice but to take you at your word. Very well: you have your year. I shall relocate the king to the northern Madino Castle for his own protection. I'll also leave my Cross Knights stationed at Sylvale Castle. Offer even the slightest provocation, and your forces will have us to answer to. Remember, I'm holding you to your word. Break your promise, and we will break you. Do I make myself clear, Sigurd?"
529,"Sigurd: Of course. You know I'm not about to betray you. Please, Eldigan. You have to trust me!"
530,"Woman: War's the most dreadful thing, and 'tis always the innocent and helpless who suffer most for it. Please... go home to your families."
531,"Young woman: Hey, thanks for saving us! I want you to have this, one of my favorite things. It's a pretty little bracelet, huh? Wear it at the shops and the nice man there'll be happy to give ya a discount!"
532,"Old man: We can't thank you enough for helpin' us. This here sword's the best we can do. It's an unusual sort, innit? They call it an armorslayer. In the right hands it'll cleave right through the thickest armor. If your hands aren't the right hands, though? Maybe it can make ya a quick but at the pawn shop in town."
533,"Man: Anphony's Lord Macbeth is the foulest, most gold-obsessed man there it. He does nothin' but torment us for his own profit. I wish I could kill em' with my bare hands!"
534,"Old man: The late King Imuka was truly a great man. His sudden passing has been nothin' but devastating for us all. He's barely been buried for long and his son Chagall's already runnin' the country into the ground! If Lord Eldigan had a claim to the throne, somehow, then we wouldn't be in this mess..."
535,"Young man: There's still gotta be descendants of the dark lord Loptous livin' somewhere, right? Folk in the big cities like Agusti an' Mackily certainly seem to think so. Every year they do these huge hunts for Loptous' spawn. They arrest a ton of people, then burn 'em all at the stake, even if they're innocent... Madness, I tell ya!"
536,"Man: The great Lord Eldigan of Nordion is a descendant of Hoðr the Brave, one of the legendary Twelve Crusaders. He wield's Hoðr's old weapon, Mystletainn, the demon blade. They say it's as strong as Isaach's Balmung and Chalphy's Tyrfing... The three mightiest blades in all of creation."
537,"Woman: Psst! Wanna hear somethin' saucy? Y'know how Lord Eldigan has a li'l sister, right? Well, lookin' at 'em, wouldn't ya say there's more to it than that? If ya know what I mean... Ohoho! I love me a li'l bit of gossip! Hmm? I've better things to do than run me mouth y'say? Fine, then."
538,"Old man: Beware of Bishop Clement, the lord of Mackily Castle. That dastard wields a magical staff that they call a Sleep staff. If you're not careful, you'll find yourself snoozin' and wide open to bein' attacked."
539,"Woman: Lord Eldigan is a sincere and righteous man, but alas, his sincerity's never been welcome to the ears of King Chagall. That's gotta be why he was locked up. Please, for the good of all Agustria... Help Lord Eldigan!"
540,"Ethlyn: How are you faring so far, Deirdre? I know my brother is worried something fierce about you risking you life like this."
541,"Deirdre: Ethlyn...? Thank you for asking, but I'm doing just fine for now. Everything will be alright. I can feel it. So long as I'm at Sigurd's side, our happiness will see us through."
542,Ethlyn: I don't think I've ever seen Sigurd as happy as he's been since he met you. He's practically a changed man!
543,Deirdre: Ethlyn... Here. I'd like you have this. I've been meaning to give it to you for a while.
544,Ethlyn: Oh? ...Is- is this a light brand?! Wow... These are so rare and hard to come by! Are you sure you want to give me this?
545,Deirdre: Of course. I know that it will serve you well.
546,"Ethlyn: I can't thank you enough, Deirdre! I'll always treasure it!"
547,Dew: Hey! Lachesis! There y'are! Check out this little beauty of a sword! Thought I'd give it to ya.
548,Lachesis: Oh? I can't say I've seen a blade so peculiar before. Does it have a name?
549,Dew: It's called a thief's sword. Wanna gut the bad guys? This thing's yer best friend.
550,"Lachesis: Er... Thank you. Although, why are you giving this to me? I'm hardly complaining, but surely you need a decent sword?"
551,"Dew: Nah, I'm not bothered. There ain't any point in me keeping it. Let's just say it does a lot more than just stab... Heh. See ya around!"
552,"Quan: Finn, these Agustrians are proving to be far worthier opponents than the thugs of Verdane, wouldn't you say? For stronger enemies, what could be more fitting than a stronger weapon? Let's see how you fare with this."
553,Finn: Is that... a brave lance?! Are you sure you want to entrust me with such a rarity?
554,"Quan: Of course. You are House Leonster's most promising young knight. You are our future, and I'd sooner see you live this day. Arming you properly is the best I can do to help for now, so yes. Take this spear."
555,"Finn: What an honor, milord! Thank you."
556,"Sigurd: Lewyn, I presume? The one who's been helping defend the villages? I appreciate the aid. As I understand it, you're a bard, but you also wield magic? That's unusual."
557,"Lewyn: Something like that. I guess it's a hobby. You're that Sigurd fellow, aren't you? It's obvious what your little hobby is: War! Clearly you've got so much spare time, you spend it starting war after war!"
558,"Sigurd: Come again? You seem angry, but-"
559,"Lewyn: Don't play dumb! Think about the people of all the countries that you're flattening! You come barging in, swords flashing, and all you do is ruin the lives of normal folk who're trying to make a living here!"
560,"Sigurd: You're right. My apologies, Lewyn... I didn't even think about that, but I can't stand knowing I've done this to them."
561,"Lewyn: Words are just words without actions backing them up. If you really feel so bad, then why not pull your army out?"
562,"Sigurd: Mm, you're right... Very well. I'll consult with my troops and arrange a retreat."
563,"Lewyn: Wait, you're serious about this?"
564,"Sigurd: Of course. I've been mulling over retreating for a while already, and you just gave me the answer to all of this. I've had enough of the war approach. I think I'd rather seek a diplomatic answer."
565,"Lewyn: Yeah, no. Trying to get through to Chagall now would be a total waste of everyone's time. Besides, if you lot pull out now, then nothing stands between a peeved king and all the citizens who've helped you so far. Are you sure you're okay with leaving them all hanging like that?"
566,"Sigurd: Well, no, but... Er... I..."
567,"Lewyn: Ahahaha! Y'know, I guess I was wrong about you. You're alright, Sigurd. Say, why don't I help you finish this fight up?"
568,"Sigurd: Er... Okay, I suppose... Who are you, anyway?"
569,"Lewyn: Who, me? I'm just a wayward bard, my friend..."
570,"Beowolf: Hey, you! You're that Nordion lady, aren't ya?"
571,Lachesis: E-excuse me?! Such boorishness! What manner of lowlife is asking?
572,"Beowolf: Oh, er, sorry 'bout that, ma'am. The name's Beowolf, a hired blade."
573,Lachesis: What do you want?
574,"Beowolf: Uh... Well, I just wanted to give ya a quick heads up about fightin'. See, war ain't the fun and games you're used to. And someone as green as you... Well, you're gonna get in the way. Besides, a princess's a princess. Why not run along back to your castle now?"
575,Lachesis: H-how dare you! My business in battle is just that: my business! Not yours! I'll nail your foul mouth closed!
576,Beowolf: Heh. You really are Eldigan's sister. Shoulda known you wouldn't be a pushover.
577,Lachesis: What's that? Do you know my brother?!
578,"Beowolf: Oh, yeah. Eldigan and me, we go way back. I'd never've been so noisy if he hadn't asked me to keep an eye on ya."
579,"Lachesis: Is that so? Oh, I'm sorry for snapping at you so."
580,"Beowolf: Eh, I've seen a lot worse in me time. Hey, how about a quick battle lesson? Eldigan thought it'd be a big help."
581,"Lachesis: Why, thank you. I'd like that."
582,"Alec: Hey! You're Silvia, aren't you? Excuse me for being so foward, but you're adorable!"
583,"Silvia: Finally! Here I was, thinkin' this army's nothin' but stiff and borin' military types. It's about time someone appreciated me!"
584,"Alec: Heh, I guess I'm the only decent guy around here. Glad I found you."
585,"Silvia: Thanks! Me, too!"
586,"Alec: I guess we'll be here a while, so how about dinner sometime? Bet that'd be nice."
587,"Silvia: Ooh, yeah! Maybe I'll dance for you too! I've got a special one that nobody's seen yet. It's kinda embarrassing, 'cause it's VERY special. Maybe I'll show it to ya, though!"
588,"Alec: Y-you will? Oh, I can't wait!"
589,Silvia: Eee! It's the great Lord Sigurd!
590,"Sigurd: Er... Hello, there? You're a dancer, right? The battlefield is too dangerous for the likes of you. Go back to the castle."
591,"Silvia: Come on, sir! Don'tcha know who I am? I'm Silviaaaaaaa! You can call me Silvie if ya want, though!"
592,"Sigurd: Look, I'm sorry, but I really don't have the time to look after children. Be a good little girl and run along back to the castle, alright?"
593,"Silvia: Rrrgh... Good little girl?! Look at me! How d'you look at someone this hot and think ""little girl""?! What is wrong with you? Never thought ya'd be such a borin' old stiff, just like everyone else 'round here..."
594,Sigurd: Enough! I have work to do.
595,"Silvia: Sigh... Oh, well. Back to being a lone, delicate flower, sprouting in a battlefield... My beauty is nothing to the tide of bodies..."
596,Sigurd: Ugh... What in the world is...
597,"Erinys: Lord Sigurd, I presume?"
598,"Sigurd: I am indeed. And you, madam?"
599,"Erinys: My name is Erinys. I'm a royal knight of Silesse. I wish to join your army, so as to keep an eye on Prince Lewyn."
600,Sigurd: Er... Prince Lewyn? What are you on about?
601,"Erinys: My lord Lewyn is the rightful heir to the Silessian crown. He is a scion of Ced, the Wind Crusader, and is the sole inheritor of his power."
602,"Sigurd: Wait, THAT Lewyn?! Heh... I knew there was something odd about him, but I'd never have thought him to be Silessian royalty. Any idea why he's pretending to be a bard?"
603,"Erinys: That's a long story, sir, and I'm hardly the most qualified to tell it. Perhaps try asking him later, but for now..."
604,"Sigurd: Fair enough. It's hardly my business, anyway. I'm glad you're here, Erinys. A pegasus knight among us would be a great help. Would you mind aiding us in battle?"
605,"Erinys: Yes, sir! I'll do my part!"
606,"Arden: ...Sigh. I don't get it. No matter how hard I train or how strong I get, I'm still the butt of every joke 'round here. Maybe if I were more like Alec, with how he can attack twice... That'd be all I need to get a bit of respect, methinks... and maybe a cute lass while I'm at it... Hee hee. But I'm still just me... Back to the ol' grind, I suppose... Hang on? What's this little ring thing? Ooh, maybe it's one of those magical ones I keep hearing about. That'd be grand, wouldn't it? Let's try her on... Hm... Hwooooarh! W-what's this power I'm feeling?! IS this what Alec feels like all the time?"

608,"Chapter 3: Lionheart Eldigan
"
609,"King Chagall has fled Agusti's fall and moved his royal court to Madino Castle in the north. Honoring his promise to Eldigan, Sigurd allows Chagall his freedom and does not interfere. Sigurd adopts Agusti as his headquarters, and while his troops there recuperate, he persists in negotiating Agustria's return to governance by its own king. Despite his determination to restore Chagall's rule, his orders from Belhalla never change: to remain in Agusti and to govern its citizens. Scarcely six months have passed, and yet Grannvale's ruling administrators have already grown arrogant and have taken to abusing their power over Agustria for their own gain. Day by day, the Agustrian people grow ever wearier of Grannvale's actions. Before long, as he feared, Sigurd finds himself yet again caught in a new conflict. Reports abound of Chagall raising his army anew at Madino Castle, vying to reclaim his lost capital from Sigurd. Further north beyond Madino, the reviled pirates of Orgahil prepare themselves to sweep in and profit from the land's chaos. Belhalla's orders demand that Sigurd must maintain control of Agusti above all else. Sigurd's heart lies heavy in the face of the impending crisis. Southwest of Madino, Eldigan's forces hold the defenses of Sylvale Castle. The looming battle for Agustria... A trial between friendship and loyalties. Before Sigurd looms a final battle in Agustria's north: a showdown fated to shape the course of Jugdral's history.
"
610,"Speaking with the Sylvale border guard
"
611,"Chagall: Is the army ready to move in? Those fools couldn't possibly see this coming. Right, as arranged. Move out! This is our final chance to return Agusti to our control. Just look at them... Lingering in my kingdom, oh-so-carefree. ...I grow weary of them. They will pay dearly for this! Jacobi! Where's that lousy sellsword gotten to this time?!"
612,"Jacobi: Need me, do you?"
613,Chagall: I've seen just how good a fighter you are. You're in charge of the castle defenses.
614,"Jacobi: Yeah, I know... Might be a boring job, but you're payin' awfully well for it. Let's see 'em learn to fear my bolt sword."
615,Chagall: That's what I like to hear. Don't fail me.
616,"Chagall: Now, Eldigan's still at Sylvale, is he? Hm... How will he take this? I wonder..."
617,"Soldier: Milord, we have a problem! The Madino army appears to be preparing for battle!"
618,"Eldigan: What?! What is His Majesty thinking, doing something so rash? Blast... To think, we were so close to returning Agusti to him! Gah... I couldn't possibly fight Sigurd. What in the world can I do now..."
619,"Dobarl: Oi, cap'n! Looks like the mainland down south's gettin' ready for 'nother war. This is gettin' interestin'... This is our chance, I reckon, with nuthin' stoppin' us from fleecin' the villages. Both them armies'll be at each other's throats, so there'll be nobody interested in gettin' between us an' th' villages."
620,"Brigid: Shut it, Dobarl! I won't allow any petty thefts under my watch. I refuse to let us sink so low. Don't forget, we're heroic thieves. That's what the name of Orgahill now means to the world!"
621,Dobarl: Bah! What self-respectin' pirate just lets the loot sit there an' does nothing?! The cap'n's gone soft!
622,"Pizarl: Now, now. Calm down, Dobarl, me mate. I've got me a li'l idea. That wench struts aroun' like the boss, but she ain't really the ol' cap'n's sprog. The cap'n jus' found 'er lost when she as a tiny thing an' raised 'er as 'is own. She still took over when 'e died, but little she knows she ain't really his brat. She ain't the real boss, so there's nuffin' t'worry 'bout. Now, let's go 'elp ourselves to sum treasure!"
623,"Oifey: Dire news, sire! King Chagall's army has struck, and they have the castle surrounded!"
624,Sigurd: What?! That fool... We were so close to finally withdrawing from Agustria. There's no sense in attacking us now! Where in blazes is Eldigan...
625,"Oifey: That isn't all, sire. It appears that pirates from Orgahil are attacking amidst the confusion."
626,"Sigurd: Is that so... I suppose we've no choice, then. Ready everyone for battle."
627,"Deirdre: My love... You're about to fight again, aren't you?"
628,"Sigurd: I'm afraid so. I'm sorry, Deirdre, but you mustn't come with me this time. Seliph is but a newborn, and he needs you."
629,"Deirdre: Yes, dear..."
630,"Sigurd: You needn't look so anxious, Deirdre. I'll be back before long. I promise. Shannan, I've a favor to ask of you. Would you look after Deirdre and Seliph, please?"
631,Shannan: Of course! Don't worry about a thing.
632,"Sigurd: Ha! As spirited as ever, Shannan. At the very least, Deirdre, he ought to keep you in good cheer. Don't worry about a thing, Deirdre. I'll be back for you. I promise."
633,Deirdre: Milord...
634,"Knight: We're not involved in this battle, on Lord Eldigan's orders. Move along."
635,"Oifey: King Chagall is nowhere to be found, sire."
636,"Sigurd: I see... He must have fled to Sylvale Castle, Eldigan is still posted there, after all. His Cross Knights are the last remains of Agustria's army. At this rate, all should be well if we can subdue them, but..."
637,"Oifey: Sire, we have a visitor. Father Claud of Edda has just arrived."
638,"Sigurd: Father Claud?! See him in, please."
639,"Claud: It's been a long time, Lord Sigurd. We need to talk. I regret to say that I bring dreadful news from the fatherland."
640,"Sigurd: What is it, Your Grace? What in the world could have happened?"
641,Claud: Prince Kurth is dead. Somebody murdered him en rout from Isaach.
642,Sigurd: What?! This can't be... Who could have done this?
643,"Claud: Lord Byron was once constantly by His Highness's side... Yet, ever since his murder, he has been nowhere to be found. I regret to say this, but... As it stands, Lord Byron - your father - is the prime suspect."
644,Sigurd: Wh-what?! That's impossible!
645,"Claud: I regret to say that there's been naught but horrid rumors in Grannvale lately. Among them are those which allege that you and your father worked in concert to assassinate the prince... Alas, His Majesty's anguish at the affair has rendered him dreadfully ill."
646,"Sigurd: My father was already the prince's closest confidant. What could he have possible gained from the prince's demise?! Surely, shouldn't Reptor, Lombard, and the others who opposed the prince be the likely culprits?"
647,"Claud: I am of the same mind, but we've no evidence tying either to the crime. And Reptor and his minions currently hold a great sway over the royal court."
648,"Sigurd: What about Lord Arvis, His Majesty's aide? Do you know where he stands on this?"
649,"Claud: I cannot say for sure. He seems to hold no enmity toward you, but I am loath to consider him an ally..."
650,"Sigurd: Hm... I'm worried for my father. If I could, I'd head home now and do what I can to help, but my orders haven't changed. I still need to hold Agustria. Please, Your Grace... Do you have any idea what I should do?"
651,"Claud: I am on my way to the Tower of Bragi, on the island to the north-west of here. As an heir to the great Saint Bragi, if I pray at our sacred tower, then the truth shall be revealed to me alone. With this knowledge, I can convince His Majesty of Byron's innocence. You needn't worry, Lord Sigurd."
652,"Tailtiu: Claaaaaud! C'mon, let's go! Stop chewing off the poor man's ear. I'm getting bored here."
653,Sigurd: Hm? Aren't you Tailtiu of House Friege? What are you doing with Father Claud?
654,Tailtiu: Wouldn't you worry if I left him to wander all on his lonesome? Somebody's got to protect him.
655,"Sigurd: But you're Duke Reptor's daughter, so..."
656,"Tailtiu: I just can't wrap my head around Father's schemes, y'know? Besides, I love the priest!"
657,"Claud: Gods, give me strength to cope with this child... Anyway, I'll rendezvous with your group once I've learned the truth. I pray we'll both return home this day."
658,"Sigurd: As do I, Father Claud. As do I. I can't thank you enough."
659,"Deirdre: Shannan, did you hear the news? Sigurd has captured Madino Castle. I... I need to see him again!"
660,"Shannan: Deirdre, no! I can't let you do that. It's still too dangerous to go out there now, and Seliph still needs you!"
661,Deirdre: I know. I want you to look after Seliph while I'm gone.
662,Shannan: No way! I'm just a kid. I can't look after a baby all by myself.
663,"Deirdre: I won't be long. I promise. Please, Shannan... I implore you..."
664,"Shannan: Okay, fine. I'll look after him. Just be careful out there and get back here as soon as you can, okay?"
665,"Deirdre: Thank you, Shannan. I'm sorry, Seliph. I'll be back for you right away."
666,Manfroy: Cigyun's daughter... I've found you at last...
667,Deirdre: Oh? Who are you? Wait... How do you know my mother?
668,"Manfroy: Kehehehe... The day of your rebirth is upon us. Through my dark magic, the slate of your life will be cleansed, paving the way for your true husband... Your fate was written the day you were born. There is no use in fighting destiny."
669,Deirdre: Wh-what are you doing?! Stop it! No!! ...Aaaah... Sig... u... r...
670,"Chagall: And just what do you think you are doing, Eldigan?! If you hadn't dawdled away your day here, then perhaps we wouldn't have lost Madino! Ah, but that's part of your plan, isn't it?! You're part of their plot to destroy Agustria, traitor!"
671,Eldigan: Your Majesty... How could you say that?
672,"Chagall: What's this? Do you dare to be displeased? To think, you've forgotten my father's favor, all to idly stall for time... You're a disgrace to the knighthood!"
673,"Eldigan: There's nothing more I can do to convince you... Very well, Your Majesty. My men and I will move out post-haste. I am proud to be a paladin of Agustria. If I must die, it shall be with sword in hand! By your leave, Your Majesty."
674,"Eldigan: This is it, men. It's time for us to enter the fray... Perhaps for the last time. I count myself the luckiest commander there is for your years of loyalty to me. The fatherland's fate hinges on this final battle. Do not let Agustria down. Cross Knights! MOVE OUT!"
675,"Chagall: Eldigan's finally moved out, has he? Pompous twit... The rest of you, fortify the defenses! I'm in command now!"
676,"Sigurd: Eldigan, please! Lay down your sword! I don't want to fight you! I still have every intention of returning Agusti to Chagall! All I need is a little more time, I swear!"
677,"Eldigan: ...Sigurd. I'm sorry, but I grow weary of these excuses. We stand now as two knights on the battlefield, sword to an honorable duel. Draw, Sigurd! So long as I wield the demon blade, Mystletainn, I won't be the one to fall this day!"
678,"Lachesis: Brother, stop! It's me, Lachesis! This pointlessness has gone on long enough! Your actions are utterly baffling! Would you really betray Sigurd, your friend? Is this what you call a knight's pride?! Please, brother! Believe in Sigurd. Give him even the tiniest amount more time to finish his job. We don't need to fight."
679,"Eldigan: Lachesis... Look, don't cry. Fighting is my only choice. Please don't make this harder than it already is. His Majesty's death will spell the death of Agustria, too, and I cannot allow that."
680,"Lachesis: That isn't true! Everything hinges on Chagall laying down his arms. Sigurd never had any interest in fighting, and has even less interest in continuing if you stop. Brother... Please. You lead the Cross Knights! Chagall simply cannot ignore your counsel!"
681,"Eldigan: ...You're right, Lachesis. I'll try and persuade His Majesty, one more time. If I must risk my life, I'd rather risk it to stop this blasted war than to fight my friend. Any knight would do the same. Lachesis... here. This sword is for you."
682,"Lachesis: Isn't this an Earth Sword?! ...Brother, you can't be-"
683,"Eldigan: This is a last memento, in case I... I'm sorry, Lachesis. You must survive!"
684,"Lachesis: W-wait! Stop! Don't go, Eldie!"
685,"Eldigan: Your Majesty, please order a retreat! There's no use in continuing this fight. Agusti shall be returned to Your Majesty someday, but it must happen peacefully."
686,"Chagall: Eldigan! How dare you abandon the battle to spout such nonsense! You couldn't hide your true colors forever, traitor! Men! Seize this... this worm! Off with his head! Humiliate him! Parade his shame before the world!"
687,Eldigan: I... this was all in vain... This spells Agustria's doom-
688,"Chagall: Tch, enough! Accept your death quietly, traitor! Finish him! Do it, right here, right NOW!"
689,Eldigan: Lachesis...
690,Sigurd: W... Why... Why did this happen? Why couldn't we save Eldigan?! Has this damned war been in vain all along...
691,"Oifey: I'm sorry, sire, but there was nothing you could have done. I know it hurts, but... For now, the best we can do is work to realize Eldigan's wishes, and give the Agustria people the peace they deserve."
692,Chagall: Travant! I trust your wyvern rider unit is ready?
693,"Travant: You can rest assured, Chagall. We'll deliver on your expectations."
694,Chagall: Hmph. I suppose even these common sellswords ought to do a better job for me than all of my worthless servants... Don't you dare let me down!
695,Papilio: Pick up the pace! Agustria's right ahead! Our targets are the knights of Grannvale. Take your fill of battle! Sear the name of Thracia into the memories of this land!
696,"Travant: Ugh... Papilio failed, did he? That does it. It's time to withdraw. I refuse to fall with this flaming wreck of a country. Heh, farewell, King Chagall... You fool."
697,Sigurd: Eldigan...
698,"Oifey: Sire... I know this is hard, but please, you mustn't lose heart just yet. By the way, Shannan has just arrived from Agusti. He'd like a word with you, sire."
699,Sigurd: Shannan?
700,"Shannan: Sigurd! I'm sorry... I'm so, so sorry!"
701,"Sigurd: What's happening, Shannan? Why are you crying?"
702,"Shannan: Deirdre's gone! She left the castle and was looking to talk to you, but she never returned. I'm sorry! I failed to protect her..."
703,"Sigurd: What?! This can't be happening! And Seliph... Shannan, what about my son?"
704,Shannan: I've got Seliph with me. See? Here he is. But Deirdre...
705,"Sigurd: I see... Shannan, this isn't your fault. Don't worry about it. We'll find her. No matter what it takes, I'll find her."
706,"Shannan: B-but, I... I should've tried harder to stop her! I'm so sorry, Sigurd!"
707,Sigurd: Deirdre... Where could you be...
708,"Dobarl: Cap'n! Big news! Agustria's lost th' war! S'only a matter of time b'fore them Grannvale guys're bangin' down our doors too, eh? What d'ya say?"
709,"Brigid: Damn it, Dobarl! The only reason they're coming is because you lot all went pillaging, against my orders! You've got nobody but yourself to blame!"
710,"Dobarl: Keh, enough! I can't take yer arrogance anymore! Shut it an' open yer ears! Ya actually ain't the daughter o' the late cap'n, y'know. Yer just some li'l girl what the boss found, cryin' alone in this ship we raided. Th'boss jus' picked ya up an' raised ya 'imself. 'Fore we knew it, ya'd all grown up an' were bossin' us all 'round, all nonsense-like!"
711,Brigid: W-what?! I... that's...
712,"Dobarl: But yer li'l act's worn its welcome out. No point keepin' ya 'live, eh?"
713,Brigid: Damn it all... You really think you clowns can take me that easy?!
714,"Dobarl: Get 'er, boys! Kill 'er quick-like! Don't let 'er escape! Pizarl, yer in charge o' the boys. Go raise a li'l hell over 'n Agustria! I'll be waitin' back at th' castle."
715,"Pizarl: Aye, boss!"
716,"Pizarl: Righ', raise the bridge! Agustria's all ours!"
717,"Tailtiu: Claaaaaud! C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! Aren't you done praying already? Just look around! There'll be pirates all over us if we don't get moving!"
718,"Claud: Be at peace, Tailtiu. This was quite the fruitful journey! Lord Bragi has answered my prayers and revealed to me the truth. It is precisely as I had thought. Not to mention, I even found House Edda's long-lost sacred heirloom within the tower: the staff of Valkyria. See? This is it."
719,"Tailtiu: What, that grubby little cane?"
720,"Claud: ...Tailtiu, please. Do try to mind your manners. This is a legendary magical staff with the power to restore life to the deceased. It is usable only be the direct descendants of Saint Bragi. That is to say, me alone."
721,"Tailtiu: Huh. So what you're saying is, with this rod you could bring my sweet old grandma back to life?"
722,"Claud: Alas, most likely not. Valkyria is limited in many particular ways, and so cannot be used on just any lost soul. You see, all of mankind is born bearing a life force called quintessence, which-"
723,"Tailtiu: Yaaawn... Er, what's that? You lost me. Why're you still talking about this, anyway? We've still gotta get outta here!"
724,"Claud: Ah, of course. Let us go."
725,"Sigurd: Good. We've subdued the pirate castle. Oifey, would you please gather our troops here? Now that this is all over, I'd like to ensure that everyone's alright."
726,"Oifey: At once, sire."
727,"Lombard: Is the army ready? Good. All units, move in! Apprehend the traitor Sigurd and his cohorts! Seize these vile allies of Byron, accomplices to his murder of Kurth and his bid to take over the kingdom! It is the will of His Majesty! No mercy for enemies of the state!"
728,"Reptor: Kehehe... Oh, Lombard. Such audacity! To think, he personally put an end to that miserable prince and nearly killed Byron for putting up a fight... I've never seen such a bold ploy! And with Arvis using His Majesty's trust, it all worked flawlessly! Convincing the king of anything is hardly a challenge, but to succeed with a tale of this scale takes quite the storyteller... And here we are, the the entirety of House Chalphy framed for the crime! Heh heh... Our victory is all but assured. The throne of Grannvale shall be mine, one way or another. I'll leave no pest who dares interfere with me alive..."
729,"Sigurd: What in blazes is this?! I'm a traitor now, and a Grannvale legion now waits at our doorstep to arrest me?!"
730,"Oifey: Sire, and to think, the war here was over at long last, and you were about to go and search for Deirdre."
731,"Sigurd: Gah... How could His Majesty have fallen for Reptor's lies? How could he possibly believe that my father, of all people, would kill Prince Kurth?! Aah... If only Father Claud had gotten back to the capital before they struck... Why?! Why is this happening?! I fought a pointless war, I let Eldigan die, and now this! What have I been fighting for all along?!"
732,Oifey: Sire...
733,"Annand: Lord Sigurd, I presume? I am Annand, a knight in the service of Silesse. Queen Lahna bade my corps and I to come and retrieve you. We invite you and your subordinates to retreat with us to Silesse, until your good name has been cleared in Grannvale."
734,"Sigurd: ...Queen Lahna of Silesse, you say? Why is Silesse willing to give aid to an alleged traitor like me?"
735,"Annand: Please, sir. Time is of the essence. The Grannvale assault is sure to begin at any moment now. My pegasus knights will escort you across the sea to safety in Silesse."
736,"Dew: Oh, whoa! This is that Tower of Bragi place, isn't it? Hee hee! Got a good thiefy feeling about this one! Let's see what it's got..."
737,"Dew: Mmm? Nope, nothin' over here. Over there, maybe? ...Aww, man! What a borin' little dump."
738,???: ...Who... Who are you...
739,Dew: Huh?!
740,???: ...State your business...
741,"Dew: Heh, maybe if I pretend I can't here 'em..."
742,???: How dare you... defile this sacred ground... ...BEGONE!
743,Dew: Kyaaa! S-sorry! Please don't hurt me!
744,"Dew: Hah... hah... What just happened?! ...Hang on. A sword? What's it doin' sitting around a place like this? Eh, who cares? Guess I'm gettin' something outta this after all!"
745,"Man: No matter how much I think about it, I just don't get why the Orgahil pirates have so suddenly turned on us like this. We could've sworn that boss of theirs was a good lass... Brigid or something, was it?"
746,"Old man: Oho! Glad to see ya've come. I got this 'ere sword for ya in 'preciation. They call it the wingslayer. It's enchanted to be lethal to sky-riders. If it flies, this sword'll bring it down. 'Course, if ya can't use it, sell it!"
747,"Politician: Oh? Here to help, are ya? Huzzah! The village is saved! We can't thank ya enough, but mayhap this magic staff'll help ya out. They call it a Restorestaff. If yer allies've been put t'sleep or silenced, one cast of this staff'll get 'em back on their feet. This oughta be a big help for ya."
748,"Woman: We're so glad to see you! Here, have a quick sip of our local special brew. For generations, it's made us all hardier!"
749,"Young woman (Sylvale has not been seized): Ah... the Cross Knights. Lord Eldigan's elite knightly battalion. Their might is legendary, and none in Jugdral can even compare to them. Actually... My boyfriend is a Cross Knight! Hee hee... amazing, isn't it? Don't be shy. Drink up! Well, how 'bout that? Feel the might swellin' in yer muscles! Oughta make yer work out there so much easier."
750,"Young woman (Sylvale has been seized): Sniff... I can't believe it. My boyfriend died in this blasted war. Damn the Grannvale army... No, no... Damn King Chagall! This is all his fault!"
751,"Young man: Hey, be careful out there! Rumor has it that King Chagall's got the infamous Thracian wyvern riders on his payroll. Don't think there's been a war lately where someone or other didn't hire 'em. They're like a pack of hyenas descendin' on fresh prey: brutal and indiscriminate. Nothin' survives in their wake..."
752,"Old woman: Oh, it's so nice to see visitors! How 'bout a little somethin' for yer troubles? Here, take a draught of our secret medicine."
753,"Woman: Ugh. I can't stand people like you who've nothin' better to do than start more wars! Why are you even here? We've absolutely nothin' to do with Agustria or Grannvale! Look. If you've really gotta fight, take it somewhere else, you thoughtless sod."
754,Lex: Ayra! Hey there.
755,"Ayra: Sigh... What do you want, Lex?"
756,"Lex: Sheesh! Courteous as ever, aren't you?"
757,"Ayra: Look, get to your point, whatever it may be. I've better things to do than waste time on you."
758,Lex: Hold on. I've got a little gift here. I thought of you the moment I saw it.
759,Ayra: You can foist it on some other woman. I've no use for such trinkets.
760,Lex: Heh... Not even something like this?
761,Ayra: Oh? ...Wait! That's-
762,"Lex: Ah, good! You're well acquainted with the famous brave sword, then."
763,Ayra: I never thought I'd see a real brave sword! Never have I seen a blade so beautiful...
764,"Lex: Glad you like it! It's yours. I guess I'll see you around, Ayra."
765,"Ayra: Er, Lex! Wait a moment!"
766,Ayra: Oh...
767,"Chulainn: Hey, Ayra! This is for you. Here."
768,"Ayra: Isn't this a brave sword? Why me, though? Shouldn't you be wielding this yourself?"
769,"Chulainn: This thing's only gonna get harder from here, yeah? You burn through blades so fast you could do with a spare or two. Look after yourself out here, okay? One day I might not be here to watch your back."
770,Ayra: Chulainn... Thank you. I promise I'll put it to good use.
771,"Ethlyn: Pardon me, dear... But I think I owe you an apology."
772,"Quan: Eh? What's happened, Ethlyn? By the look of it, it must be grave indeed..."
773,Ethlyn: Here. Take this.
774,Quan: A spear? ...What?! I-isn't this Gáe Bolg?! Why do you-
775,"Ethlyn: Your lord father entrusted it to me, Quan. He thought it prudent for you to have it at hand, in case our battles grew too fierce."
776,"Quan: Even just holding it, I've seldom felt so strong! Why did you wait till now, though?"
777,"Ethlyn: With the spear, your lord father also passed onto me its tale... I'm so sorry..."
778,Quan: ...Aye. Gáe Bolg bears the baggage of a truly sad legend. But that is all it is: a legend.
779,Ethlyn: But-
780,"Quan: Ethlyn, trust me. Triumph is within our grasp this day. I'll not fall victim to an old myth. I'll not let it stop me from returning home. Our dear little Altena still awaits us, and I'll not allow some fairy tale to disappoint her."
781,"Ethlyn: Yes... Quan, no matter what happens... We'll never lose each other... Right?"
782,"Quan: Ah, you're concerned about Deirdre, aren't you... There's nothing to worry about. It won't be long until we find her."
783,"Ethlyn: Yes... I want to believe she'll be okay, too. I wish I could believe it. But..."
784,Quan: Ethlyn? Come now! Dry your tears. Do you truly feel so bad about this?
785,"Ethlyn: I... Yes... Knowing th-that Sigurd and Deirdre may never meet again... Th-they love each other so... so much... Why, Quan... Why did this happen to them?!"
786,Quan: Ethlyn...
787,"Sigurd: Are you holding up okay, Brigid?"
788,Brigid: Huh? Who're you? Wait... How do you know my name?!
789,"Sigurd: The villagers told me of a woman who leads the pirates of Orgahil, and of her devotion to aiding the poor and weak. That would be you, correct?"
790,"Brigid: You must be that Grannvale man... Sigurd, right? Guess this is it. Come on. Just get it over with."
791,"Sigurd: Ahahaha! Oh no, you're mistaken! I'm certain not here to kill you. I just want to talk to you, Brigid. I'd like you to ally with us. We'd love to add your strength to our own, to help us better fight the pirates. What say you?"
792,"Brigid: Wait. You really want me, of all people?"
793,Sigurd: Certainly! You'd be a tremendous asset.
794,"Brigid: You're a strange little man, Sigurd..."
795,"Edain: Pardon me, but are you not... Yes! It is you! My sister! Brigid! I am Edain, your sister! Surely you recall me?"
796,"Brigid: What? How do you know my name? Hang on... You look just like me! Edain, huh... It sounds kinda familiar... But where from?"
797,"Edain: Brigid, listen well. I am your twin sister! We lost you to pirates years ago, when you were just five years old. I've searched for you for years. I never lost hope that we would meet again."
798,Brigid: This is all so sudden... No. Weird feelings like this aren't enough! I need proof!
799,"Edain: Proof, you say? Here. Draw this bow."
800,"Brigid: Huh? Okay, that's a nice bow and all, but what's it gotta do with anything? Guess I'll humor you. So I draw it and- ...Whoa! W-what's going on?! The hell is this...? I... What's this weird feeling boiling within me... Are these memories? Ah... my heart is on fire... Edain? Yes... I remember now! You're Edain... my sister."
801,"Edain: Oh, thank the gods! You remember! That bow is your birthright, Brigid. It is Yewfelle, the sacred bow of Yugvi. Legends tell that the exalted weapons of this land, such as this one, can only be wielded by a single heir per generation. For House Yugvi and Yewfelle, that rightful heir is you, Brigid. I trust this proof will suffice?"
802,"Brigid: Oh, Edain... Come here... Let me get a good look at you... How's our father doing? And our brother... Andorey, right?"
803,"Edain: I've so much to tell you, too... Brigid... My sister."
804,Midir: ...Lady Edain?
805,Brigid: Huh? Who're you? You don't look familiar.
806,"Midir: Oh, sorry! You're not her. My mistake. But then, that must make you..."
807,"Brigid: What's this you're mumbling about? Speak up, you weird little man!"
808,Midir: Er... May I ask your name?
809,Brigid: I'm Brigid.
810,Midir: Brigid... You're gorgeous...
811,Brigid: Excuse me?! You've gotta be joking!
812,Midir: I must be dreaming... There's another one... And she's even more beautiful!
813,Brigid: Ugh... That's it!
814,Claud: Lord Sigurd! I apologize for the wait.
815,"Sigurd: Father Claud, you're safe! We heard about how you ended up amidst all those pirates. Everyone was so worried."
816,"Claud: I'm glad Tailtiu was close at hand. We may not have survived, if not for her magic. More importantly, Lord Sigurd, my prayers to Saint Bragi were answered."
817,"Sigurd: You have the truth of all this, then?"
818,"Claud: That I do. As I thought, Duke Reptor is behind all of this. On his orders, it was Duke Lombard who killed Prince Kurth. The two then successfully framed your father, Lord Byron, for the crime."
819,Sigurd: Just as I thought...
820,"Claud: The pair's treachery runs deeper still. The murder of Isaach's King Mananan was also the handiwork of Duke Reptor. He feared a peaceful end to the war would end the sole excuse for the conquest of Isaach, so he secretly had the king killed."
821,Sigurd: Is that so... Reptor's grubby hands are all over this mess...
822,"Claud: Not quite. In the shade of his avarice, there's something else at work... Something unsettling and terrifying. Not even Lord Bragi could scry this evil presence, obscured by its power as it is."
823,"Sigurd: An evil presence? Could it be that dark priesthood... Wait! What of my father, Claud?"
824,"Claud: Lord Byron yet lives, but is injured and weak. I fear he is not long for this world..."
825,Sigurd: Father... This can't be happening...
826,"Claud: I'll hasten back to the capital. His Majesty needs to hear the truth. Lord Sigurd, for the time being, stay here and restrain yourself from rash action."
827,"Sigurd: Understood. I can't thank you enough, Father Claud. I beg of you, do everything you can. Save my father and his good name."
828,Claud: Our fates lie with the mercy of the gods...

"
832,"The unthinkable has come to pass. Sigurd is now a traitor in the eyes of his beloved Grannvale. In desperation, his army flees to find refuge in the northern Kingdom of Silesse. Silesse was founded by the Wind Crusader, Ced. It lies under the watchful guard of the valiant pegasus knights and wind mages, and so for over a century since its foundation, Silesse has maintained itself as a neutral nation and persistent all invaders. However, ever since the death of its king several years ago, the royal family has been plagued with strife over its inheritance, and shades of war creep over the peaceful land. The late king and his wife, Queen Lahna, had a single son, Prince Lewyn. The king's greedy younger brother, Duke Daccar, objects to Lewyn being heir to the throne and has confined himself to Zaxon Castle in protest. As if acting in concert, the king's youngest brother, Duke Myos, has set to work raising an army for himself at Tófa Castle. Out of disgust at his uncles, Prince Lewyn left Silesse to travel the world years ago. Is there no end to the dukes' avarice? Their lust for power will condemn Silesse, a beautiful and majestic land, to the searing ravages of a brutal war.

841,"Oifey: Sire, Queen Lahna is here to see you."
842,Sigurd: Queen Lahna?
843,"Lahna: Good evening, Lord Sigurd. Are you comfortable settled into Sailane yet? Is there anything at all that you need?"
844,"Sigurd: As much as I appreciate the offer, we're fine. I can't thank you enough for your hospitality, Your Highness."
845,"Lahna: I know Sailane is perhaps too small to house all of you adequately, and I'm sorry, but please, bear with me for a while longer... I'm doing all I can to hasten your liberty. I've sent letter after letter to Belhalla to advocate for your innocence. As of yet, however, I've still heard nothing at all from King Azmur."
846,"Sigurd: This... This has to be Reptor's doing! First he betrays my father, and now he's stopping all of your letters! He must be!"
847,"Lahna: Calm yourself, Lord Sigurd! I know well the pain you're feeling, but you cannot let your grudges rule you. Your anger will not save your father. Hatred will only destroy you from within. I swear to you, I can and I will find a way to set this to rights, but you must be patient."
848,"Sigurd: You're right... I'm sorry, Your Highness. I really appreciate all you've done for me."
849,"Lahna: It's alright, Lord Sigurd. Oh, before I forget... There actually has been some good news from Grannvale of late."
850,"Sigurd: Good news, you say?"
851,Lahna: Mm. A previously unknown daughter of Prince Kurth has been discovered. All of Grannvale is rejoicing at the news.
852,Sigurd: Huh?! Is that even possible?
853,"Lahna: It took King Azmur only a glance to recognize her true heritage. She bears the brand of Naga, the proof of a true heiress to House Belhalla. There is no doubt. She is Kurth's child."
854,"Sigurd: I see... Thank goodness. At the very least, this means the royal lineage won't go extinct."
855,"Lahna: That's not all. The princess and Duke Arvis are in a relationship. King Azmur has given his blessing, and a magnificent wedding will soon be held."
856,Sigurd: Arvis? Really?
857,"Lahna: All who've seen the happy couple eagerly attest that this beautiful princess and Duke Arvis are perfectly matched together. To say nothing of how happy the couple is said to be! Young love is wonderful, isn't it? ...Oh. Lord Sigurd, I'm so sorry. I forgot. Your wife is still-"
858,"Sigurd: Deirdre... My wife's still gone, yes... It's been over a year since she vanished. She's missed an entire year of watching Seliph grow up."
859,"Lahna: I'm so sorry, Lord Sigurd, but cheer up. I know you'll reunite someday."
860,"Sigurd: You're right. I feel it, too. I can't give in to sorrow just yet. I can't give up on finding her."
861,"Annand: Pardon me, milady, but the hour is late. We should be on our way soon."
862,"Lahna: Ah, of course. I'll be with you in a moment. Lord Sigurd, one last thing... Beware of Duke Myos of Tófa. I regret to say that my brother-in-law has long hungered to claim Sailane for himself. It's only a matter of time till he goes so far as to attack you. I wish I could provide you with reinforcements, but..."
863,"Sigurd: ...I know. The capital is under the very same threat from Duke Daccar of Zaxon. You cannot afford to weaken your own guard. Daccar will pounce upon you given even a hint of weakness. Don't worry about it, Your Highness. There's nothing the Tófa army can throw at us that we can't handle."
864,"Lahna: Ah, of course. I should be more confident in such veteran heroes as yourselves. Oh! I've been talking for so long, I lost track of the time. Take care, Lord Sigurd."
865,"Sigurd: You, too, Your Highness. Thank you."
866,"Lewyn: Mother! Aren't you forgetting somebody? You've just chatted for hours and hours with Sigurd, yet you can't even acknowledge your own son?"
867,"Lahna: My son? The one who abandoned me two years ago, going gods know where? How do I talk to someone who's clearly not here?"
868,"Lewyn: Heh heh... So this is how it's going to be, is it? You're still mad at me, then?"
869,"Lahna: Of course I am! Do you have any idea how hard it was without you, and how worried I've been after you? That my own son could be so cold-hearted... I thought I knew you better than this."
870,"Lewyn: Look, I know you're upset, but I had my reasons for all this. But come on, I'm home safely! Surely that counts for something and you can forgive me? I swear I'll make up for it and be the very picture of a good son. Hey, how about I give you a shoulder massage to start?"
871,"Lahna: Oh! What nerve! Treating me as if I'm an old crone... Look, Lewyn, there are more pressing matters which we need to talk about, and soon. Come to Silesse as soon as possible. Do not forget! Do I make myself clear?"
872,Lewyn: ...Sigh. I thought she'd never stop.
873,"Annand: Don't be fooled by your mother's outward behavior, milord. She's actually very happy, now you've returned. Indeed, she hasn't been anything as cheerful as this since before you left."
874,"Lewyn: Thanks, Annand. Knowing you're at her side is a big relief. Look after her, okay?"
875,"Annand: Yes, sir! Rest assured, I will protect the queen with my life, on my honor as the captain of the Silessian pegasus knights."
876,"Lewyn: Thanks. Oh, one more thing... Are you gonna leave Erinys here with Sigurd?"
877,"Annand: I am... Milord, I'd like you to keep my sister at your side. She-"
878,Erinys: Annand!
879,"Annand: Oh. Eavesdropping, were you, Erinys?"
880,"Erinys: You were about to tell him too much, so..."
881,"Annand: Ah. My apologies, Erinys. There are things he shouldn't know just yet, of course... Erinys, I'll be leaving with Queen Lahna and returning to Silesse Castle shortly. You'll stay here and keep and eye on Prince Leywn. Best of luck."
882,"Erinys: Thank you, Annand."
883,"Quan: Sigurd, we'll now be taking our leave. It's high time we returned to Leonster. Rest assured, we'll be back, this time leading the full military might of Leonster to your aid. May that day come soon, my friend."
884,"Ethlyn: I'm going with Quan, Sigurd. Don't worry, though. We'll be back before you know it! Take care of yourself."
885,"Finn: By your leave, sir, I'll be departing with my lord. Thank you for all you've done for us. Don't give up, sir. One day, I know, the charges against you will be cleared and your good name restored. I know you can do this."
886,Sigurd: Thank you. You've got quite the journey back to Leonster ahead of you. I wish I could do more to help you on your way. May your journey be a safe one!
887,"Finn: Sir, thank you for everything. I’m heading back to Leonster to help Quan assemble some reinforcement troops. I know you’ll be cleared of that false accusation soon. Stay strong and persevere."
888,Sigurd: Thanks. You’ve got a long trip ahead of you. I wish I could help you out somehow… I’ll be praying for your safety.
889,Myos: Díthorba! Is the army ready to deploy yet?
890,"Díthorba: Yes, sir. Bishop Cuvuli's wind mage unit has infiltrated the forests near Sailane. They await your command, sir."
891,"Myos: Very well. Relay my orders to Cuvuli: move in on Sailane! Díthorba, I trust your pegasus corps are already briefed on your mission?"
892,"Díthorba: Yes, sir. Our task is clear. My squadron is to raid the enemy from above, disrupting their tactics."
893,Myos: Good. Now get to work! Grannvale will owe us a handsome reward for bringing them the heads of their infamous traitors! Heh heh heh...
894,"Cuvuli: There's the signal to assault Sailane, as planned. I trust you're all ready? Move in! Teach the traitorous scum the terror of a wind mage's wrath!"
895,"Daccar: The Tófa army's attacking? Looks like Myos has finally made his move. Heh heh... Why, this little drama is finally getting interesting. Wouldn't you say, Pamela?"
896,"Pamela: Indeed, sir. However, as I recall we didn't account for Sigurd's fugitives being here. Their strength poses a real risk to the plan. If Myos at least succeeds in weakening them, perhaps Silesse's fall will still go smoothly?"
897,"Daccar: Even if he fails, I still have my private deal with Grannvale in my favor. Their Lord Andrey should arrive shortly with a battalion of reinforcements. Heh heh... My victory is certain, Pamela! I'll be sitting on the Silessian throne by the end of the week!"
898,"Pamela: Without a doubt, sir."
899,"Silvia: Hey! Hey, Erinys! You totally like Lewyn, don't ya? Like, do ya really like him?"
900,"Erinys: Huh? I... that's... Er, no. Prince Lewyn is beloved and respected by all the people of Silesse, myself included."
901,"Silvia: Oh? Okay, then. Then I guess you'd be okay with me and Lewyn getting together, right?"
902,Erinys: Er... Yes. I wouldn't really mind...
903,Silvia: Reeeeally? That wouldn't bug ya at all?
904,"Erinys: No, I'm sure I'd have no issue. Why do you ask? Am I supposed to object?"
905,"Silvia: I dunno! But if it's all fine by ya, then I guess it's time for me to go work my magic on Lewyn..."
906,"Erinys: Er... The thing is, a prospective queen of Silesse ought to possess the same grace and dignity as our Queen Lahna."
907,"Silvia: Oh, so you're sayin' I'm not cut out for it? How rude!"
908,"Erinys: Er, no... That isn't-"
909,Silvia: Hrmph! Fine then! I'll show you!
910,Erinys: .....
911,"Myos: Hm? I'd say those traitors are drawing perhaps a bit too close for comfort. You there! Raise the Tófa River drawbridge! Without this key, there's no way they'll ever get over here. Heh heh... I almost wish I could see the looks on their faces!"
912,"Dew: What, just one of these locks? C'mon, at least gimme a challenge... Ta-da!"
913,"Oifey: Sire, the Tófa village elder would like a word with you."
914,"Sigurd: Of course. Actually, I'd imagine we need to talk this situation over. Bring him in."
915,"Old man: Lord Sigurd, I presume? We can't thank you enough for getting rid of Lord Myos. The entire population of Tófa is rejoicing at his downfall!"
916,"Sigurd: Hm? Are you sure? I mean, I just conquered you. Am I not the enemy here?"
917,"Old man: Lord Myos was nothing but a tyrant. All he ever did was bleed us dry. You fight in the name of Queen Lahna, and there isn't a Silessian alive who doesn't bear the utmost adoration for our queen."
918,"Sigurd: Is that so? Thank you. Anyway, in the interim I think I'll leave governing Tófa to you, sir. Once the crisis has settled, the queen will be in touch to arrange a proper successor. Until then, I'm sure you'll be a just governor to help heal Tófa's wounds."
919,"Old man: Very well. Please, Lord Sigurd, do all you can to protect the queen. She is a treasure to us, and a beacon of peace and kindness."
920,"Sigurd: Rest assured, my good man. So long as I live, I swear that I'll let no harm come to Queen Lahna. You have my word."
921,"Daccar: Tófa has fallen, has it... I almost feel bad for my brother: little more than a pawn in my dreams who'd outlived his usefulness. Pamela, it's your turn. Lead your pegasus knights into battle at once! Sigurd is well clear of the capital. Seize it while he has no chance of aiding them!"
922,"Pamela: Yes, sir!"
923,"Annand: Dire news, milady! Zaxon has deployed Pamela's pegasus unit and they're closing in on the capital."
924,"Lahna: What?! This can't be happening! ...So, at long last, Daccar has put to rest his tired old façade of innocence."
925,"Annand: Be at ease, milady. My squad will keep Pamela's at bay."
926,"Lahna: Annand, are you sure you can do this? I've heard stories of the sheer terror of Pamela's might as a warrior."
927,"Annand: Of course... I know better than to take lightly such a formidable foe. But remember, I am one of the Four Heavenly Knights of Silesse. I never enter a battle ill prepared."
928,"Lahna: Ah... I'm so sorry, Annand. I already know well how you feel about all this, but... I..."
929,"Annand: To fight in your name is the only life I know... Milady, please. Don't worry about me so much. If that's all, then, I'll be going. Knights, to me! Move out!"
930,"Daccar: Ah. Duke Andrey, I presume? You certainly took your time getting here... And... Oh! How magnificent! So this is Yngvi's renowned bow knight legion!"
931,"Andrey: Hmhmhm... Alas, my father is dead, and my sister is a fugitive among the traitors. This leaves me, and me alone, as the Duke of Yngvi and the leader of our legion! Against the might of the Beige Ritter, these winged ponies stand no chance at all! Now, sit back and watch them drop like flies!"
932,"Annand: It's been a while, Pamela... I've known you for years, ever since we trained side by side to become knights. But not once did I ever suspect we would someday find ourselves as enemies."
933,"Pamela: Annand... Only you would be so foolish as to insist on following your queen to her inevitable grave! Why should I complain, though? After all, once you're out of the way, that leaves me as the greatest knight of Silesse!"
934,"Annand: The only fool here is you, Pamela! No... It's too late to change your mind. You're so set on your fate... Very well. All I can do for you now is give you a last honorable duel befitting a Silessian knight."
935,"Pamela: Heh... Saccharine as ever, aren't you?"
936,"Lahna: Annand has been killed?! Ahh... How could this happen... I'm so sorry, Annand... Forgive me..."
937,Lewyn: What? Annand's dead?! ...Y-you're joking!!
938,Erinys: Huh? Annand was... No! Th... this can't be happening! How... how could anyone have killed her? This can't be...
939,"Andrey: Heh... I expected so much more from Silesse's famous pegasus knights... No matter. I suppose we might as well bring down the capital while we're here. Pamela, your unit will cross the mountains. Besiege and capture Tófa immediately."
940,Pamela: Very well.
941,Andrey: The capital is under our control? Good. Mission accomplished. We ride for Grannvale at once!
942,"Daccar: Heh... At long last. The capital is mine, and mine alone! Now, I want a wind mage unit deployed south of Silesse River. Fortify our defensive line there. Furthermore... Donovan! You and your axemen are to occupy the capital and maintain its defenses. But don't even think about killing the queen. We can't waste a hostage of such high value."
943,"Donovan: Got it, sir!"
944,Lahna: Hurry! You need to flee as fast as you can!
945,"Young woman: But, Your Highness..."
946,"Lahna: I'll be okay! Look after yourselves, please!"
947,"Young man: People, please! The queen wants us to run, so come on! Run!"
948,"Donovan: Huh? Where the hell are all the townsfolk?! Ugh... they scarpered, didn't they? Damn it! They took all the fun outta this! Boys, it's up to you now! Get out there and butcher those little pigs! No survivors! Understand?"
949,"Lahna: No! Please, stop! My citizens are as innocent as they come! It matters not what happens to me, but please, don't harm my people!"
950,"Donovan: I don't think so. You've been screwin' up Lord Daccar's will long enough, missy. 'Bout time you learned your lesson!"
951,Lahna: Ahh...
952,Daccar: Heh... It appears leaving this to Donovan was a good idea after all.
953,"Lamia: Well, now! It's been a long time since I've seen such darling villainy anywhere! It's almost enough to turn a weaker stomach."
954,"Daccar: Coming from someone like you, willing to kill anyone, anywhere, anytime so long as you're handsomely paid, that's quite a claim. High praise indeed, if it's from the infamous ""Lamia the Infernal""."
955,"Lamia: Ohoho! Quite the flatterer, aren't you? Now, where do we begin with our mayhem?"
956,"Daccar: For now, your group will guard the castle. Be ready to roll out your traditional welcome in case Sigurd's thugs try causing us grief."
957,"Lamia: Guard duty? Really? Where's the fun in that? Eh, no matter. It's your money. Oi, ladies! Listen up! We're on guard duty. Stick to the castle, and pick off the enemy's leftovers if they come!"
958,"Donovan: Huh? So the Sailane army's finally comin'? Good! It's 'bout time I gave those damned rebels the axe! Boys, get off yer sorry hinds! Guard the castle no matter what. Don't let 'em get anywhere near it!"
959,Young woman: Ah! Are you here to help me? I couldn't possibly thank you enough!
960,"Young man: Oh! You're here to save me? Thank you so, so much!"
961,Sigurd: Your Highness! I'm so glad you're unharmed. My sincerest apologies for not coming to your aid sooner.
962,"Lahna: It's fine, Lord Sigurd. That you've made it here is more than enough. I... I'm sorry I couldn't do more. Too many people have died, and I could only stand by and watch... I can't bear it. And... and Annand..."
963,"Sigurd: Don't worry, Your Highness. Annand's killers will die this day by my hand. Daccar's crimes are beyond forgiveness. I promise you: he will not escape me. With this in mind, I humbly request your authorization to assault Zaxon Castle."
964,"Lahna: Lord Daccar's petty greed has condemned my people to utter agony long enough. He is a murderer. Nothing more, nothing less. You may visit justice upon him, Lord Sigurd."
965,"Sigurd: Understood. I'll mobilize my army to capture Zaxon immediately. For now, Your Highness, please get some rest."
966,"Lahna: Do take care of yourself, Lord Sigurd. As soon as Zaxon is under your control, I'll be coming by for a word with you."
967,"Daccar: Oh, you must be joking! Those accursed rebels have already re-captured Silesse?! What in the blazes is Donovan even doing out there?"
968,Daccar: Blast... We've no choice. Instruct Lamia to move out and attack at once! They mustn't be allowed near my castle!
969,Daccar: Tell Pamela’s unit to chase down Sigurd’s army. We’ll have to pull an all-out assault!
970,"Lamia: Wow, even something so tiny gets Daccar panicking... No matter. Let's go, ladies! We've got quite the feast ahead of us!"
971,Sigurd: Your Highness! I'm so glad you're unharmed. My sincerest apologies for not coming to your aid sooner.
972,"Lahna: It's fine, Lord Sigurd. That you've made it here is more than enough. I... I'm sorry I couldn't do more. Too many people have died, and I could only stand by and watch... I can't bear it. And... and Annand..."
973,"Sigurd: Don't worry, Your Highness. We've already put an end to Annand's killers. That said, in our haste we neglected to get your consent to do so. My apologies."
974,"Lahna: It's alright, Lord Sigurd. I couldn't possibly thank you enough for all of your help today. I'll come by Zaxon Castle later, once everything has settled here. May we meet again then, Lord Sigurd."
975,"Lewyn: Mother! You're not hurt, are you? When I heard that Silesse had fallen, I... I was pretty worried there."
976,"Lahna: Thank you so much for coming, Lewyn. Perhaps at last, you've matured into a young man who honors his promises. Perhaps Lord Sigurd has had quite the positive influence on you after all."
977,"Lewyn: Oh, come on, Mother! You don't need to act like I'm still a child. Besides, Sigurd is hardly all that much older than I am."
978,"Lahna: Dear, compared to the likes of Lord Sigurd, you may as well still be a screaming infant. You've still much to learn from him, and quickly. Nothing would be more reassuring than having a son as fine as he by my side. Especially now that Annand is... Oh..."
979,"Lewyn: Annand... I should've been the one to die out there. Not her. If only I'd gotten here sooner! Mother, I'll be here to protect you from now on. I won't let Annand's death go to waste. I swear, I will never, ever leave you again."
980,"Lahna: Oh, Lewyn... I never thought you were capable of saying anything so kind. But your word is more than enough. For now, at least, I believe you should remain at Lord Sigurd's side. He has a greater need of your strength."
981,"Lewyn: But if I do that, what about you...?"
982,"Lahna: There's nothing to worry about, Lewyn. You are the heir of the wind crusader. Your place is with the rest of the world, to lead and guide it on its true path. The time has come for me to confer upon you your true birthright... The exalted wind tome, Forseti. Here, Lewyn. It's yours."
983,Lewyn: This... So this is the royal family's ancestral tome... The Book of Forseti... Oh! This power... What's this... warmth?
984,"Lahna: Lewyn, never forget: the Wind Crusader flows as the gentlest breeze. His way is to guide all the peoples of the world on the path of peace. Hate and violence is never his answer."
985,"Lewyn: Yes, of course. I don't think I could live my life any other way."
986,"Lahna: Indeed. Perhaps you truly are a child of the wind... Lewyn... It's time for you to go. Take care out there, and... And don't do anything too rash."
987,Lewyn: Mother...
988,"Lahna: Go on! ...For heaven's sake, go..."
989,"Lewyn: Okay, mother please take care of yourself."
990,Lahna: Oh... Lewyn...
991,"Oifey: Sire, Queen Lahna has arrived."
992,"Lahna: Lord Sigurd, that was quite the fierce battle, wasn't it? Are you unharmed?"
993,"Sigurd: Yeah. Somehow, I'm okay."
994,"Lahna: I know I've asked so much of you already, Lord Sigurd, but would you and your army please station yourselves here at Zaxon? Grannvale's Lord Lombard has already swept in with an immense army and conquered Lubeck Castle, to our east. The people of Silesse are terrified that this will prove to be but a prelude to a full-scale war with Grannvale."
995,"Sigurd: Your Highness, I believe Lombard's army is here only for me. I've no desire to needlessly endanger you or your citizens, after all you've done for us. My men and I are leaving. Now. I have a score to settle with Lombard."
996,Lahna: What recklessness! How could you possibly prevail like this?
997,"Sigurd: They're coming for me no matter what. If we remain here, then they'll just invade. We can't afford to waste time debating this."
998,Lahna: Is that so... How sad...
999,"Sigurd: Your Highness... Thank you so much. You've given me the most wonderful year here, and you've done so much to put my mind at ease. My mother died when I was still very young, so as I grew up, I never knew the unconditional love of a mother.. But thanks to you, here in Silesse, I've come to know that very same warmth. You're like a second mother to me now... Take care of yourself, Your Highness. I hope that someday, once this is all over, we'll have a chance to meet again."
1000,"Lahna: As do I, Lord Sigurd. Please, stay vigilant out there, and keep yourself safe. From the bottom of my heart, I pray that you and Deirdre will soon be reunited."
1001,"Old man: Magic is governed by a hierarchy of power, just like weapons. Fire magic bests wind, wind bests thunder, and thunder bests fire. However, dark and light magic have an advantage over all of the others. Think your strategies through with care."
1002,"Old man: Only a direct holy descendant can inherit the full breadth of the power of the gods. And only they'll be able to wield their family's divine heirlooms. However, if kin intersect, their offspring'll have their exalted blood enriched and'll reap almighty powers. Needless to say, mind, doin' that is condemned and forbidden..."
1003,"Old man: Bein' of holy ancestry can bestow a number of powers onto ya. Divine heirs can wield even the most advanced weapons with ease, and'll have an easier time growin' stronger. 'Course, it's not every day you meet someone blessed with that sorta blood."
1004,"Old man: The Silesse royal family wields the power of wind, as bestowed by the wind god, Forseti. House Velthomer wields the power of fire, as bestowed by the fire goddess, Fjalar. And House Friege wields thunder powers, as bestowed by the thunder god, Thrud."
1005,"Old man: The sinister powers of the dark god Loptous can be fought only with the glorious powers of Naga, our great god. Only Grannvale's House Belhalla, the heirs to Saint Heim, inherit Naga's power."
1006,"Old man: Should Prince Kurth's daughter bear a son, that son would be heir to Grannvale's throne. I daresay this makes Lord Arvis, husband to the princess, quite the influential figure."
1007,"Old man: Legend has it that all direct heirs to the Crusaders bear exalted brands on their bodies, which appear on them in their infancy. Prince Kurth's daughter has her Naga brand on her forehead. Actually, that was how they recognized her as a direct heiress to Saint Heim."
1008,"Man: Oh! Lord Sigurd's army is here to save us all! Hang on... Aren't you a dancer, miss? If you don't mind, perhaps you could do a little dance for us? It's been so long since we've had time for respite or fun..."
1009,"Silvia: Yep not a problem! If you think it'll help everyone cheer up a bit, then I'm gonna dance my feet off! ...Okay! Heeeere we go!"
1010,Silvia: Hah!
1011,Silvia: Yeah!
1012,Silvia: Hyaaaah!
1013,"Silvia: Whew... Well, how 'bout that? Everyone feelin' a little better?"
1014,"Man: Oh! What fantastic dancin'! I dunno how, but now I feel like I'm ready to give life my all! I can't thank you enough, miss. Here, perhaps this magic sword'll help ya out. It oughta do a fine job of keeping ya safe."
1015,"Tailtiu: Hey, Azelle? Wait up a sec."
1016,Azelle: Tailtiu? Is something wrong?
1017,Tailtiu: I need to ask you something quick.
1018,Azelle: Hm? Me?
1019,"Tailtiu: Yeah. That okay? I mean, we've been friends for years. And I don't think there's anyone else who I can ask about this."
1020,"Azelle: Huh. You look downright grim and serious... If you really think I can help, then sure. What seems to be the problem?"
1021,"Tailtiu: Well... I, er... I'm only with you lot because I was just following Claud around, but I'm starting to think I shouldn't have done that..."
1022,Azelle: What makes you think so?
1023,"Tailtiu: It's because people are acting kinda like they're treading carefully 'round me. And when I'm around, people stop talking about my father..."
1024,"Azelle: Ah... That certainly doesn't sound fun. But I'd say people really do like you. It's more that they honestly aren't sure how they should treat you, and that they're worried they'll cause you grief. Don't worry too much. It'll all be fine once they get to know you better."
1025,"Tailtiu: Yeah... Guess you're right. Thanks, Azelle. Think I might be feeling a bit better 'bout this now."
1026,"Azelle: Hah! Glad you're back to normal, Tailtiu. If you're ever feeling like this again, I'll always be here to help you through it, no matter what happens."
1027,Tailtiu: Okay. Thanks!
1028,"Sigurd: I'm so sorry I dragged you into this mess as well, Father Claud."
1029,"Claud: It's fine. If anything, I'm sorry that my efforts to aid you simply weren't enough. I did return to Grannvale, and I was about to relate the truth to His Majesty. But Reptor interfered before I could do anything, and now I, too, am branded a traitor to the motherland."
1030,"Sigurd: Ugh. I've had enough of just sitting here and letting Reptor have his sorry way! I swear, I've half a mind to storm straight into Grannvale and end this once and for all!"
1031,"Claud: No. You know better than to rely on brute force or risk the common folk's safety. For now, Lord Sigurd, we must endure."
1032,"Sigurd: But, Father Claud-"
1033,"Claud: Make no mistake. I feel your pain, too, but this crisis's end now lies in fate's hands. There is nothing any of us can do to save ourselves anymore."
1034,"Edain: Midir, I have something for you."
1035,"Midir: …This is a Hero Bow, right? It’s okay for me to have this?"
1036,Edain: Yes. I bought it specifically for you. Silesse’s Pegasus Knights are fierce opponents. Now you’ll be able to properly defend yourself.
1037,Midir: My lady… I still feel like I’m in a dream or something. Being with you is all I ever wanted in life…
1038,"Edain: I’ve also felt the same way, Midir. I had wanted to say something to you for so long. Just call me Edain, okay? Now, don’t get yourself hurt out here. I’ll be praying for you."
1039,"Edain: Jamke, please have this bow."
1040,"Jamke: Wow, this is a… Hero Bow, right? You’re sure I can have it?"
1041,"Edain: I want you to have it, Jamke. Silesse’s Pegasus Knights are fierce. Now you’ll be able to properly defend yourself."
1042,"Jamke: Thank you, Edain. I’ll take good care of this. Let’s catch up when this fighting is all over."
1043,Edain: Jamke… I’ll be praying for you.
1044,"Edain: Take care of yourself out here, Azelle."
1045,"Azelle: Right. And you as well, Edain."
1046,Edain: This still feels so odd... Not once did I ever think that one day we would be together like this.
1047,"Azelle: It's because I'm younger than you, right?"
1048,"Edain: Oh, no. I'm still not sure why..."
1049,"Azelle: I still can't quite believe it, either! That you're now my wife... It all still feels like I'm living in some kind of dream!"
1050,Edain: Hm? How so? Don't you believe our marriage feels right?
1051,"Azelle: It's not that. It's because, er... Well, you're so beautiful... Even though I was still very young, when I saw you for the first time years ago, my heart just wouldn't stop pounding! Ever since that day, you were the only one for whom I've ever felt this way."
1052,"Edain: Oh, Azelle..."
1053,"Azelle: It's still pretty embarrassing to admit... Oh, I almost forgot! This is for you. This is a Rescue staff. You can use it bring people far away back to your side instantly. I know you'll put it to good use."
1054,"Edain: I'm so happy to be with you, Azelle. I'll always treasure having such a kind and gentle soul as you by my side..."
1055,"Silvia: Hello there, mister Father!"
1056,Claud: Hm? And who are you?
1057,Silvia: I'm Silviiiiiiiia!
1058,"Claud: Well then, Miss Silvia, how can I help? Have you, perchance, recently run afoul of bandits?"
1059,Silvia: What's that?
1060,"Claud: Well, er... I'm not sure how to put this... You're wearing nothing but smallclothes."
1061,"Silvia: Eh?! Watch your mouth, mister Father! Haven't you seen dancers like me before? This is just a dancer's clothes. It's just like you wearin' your churchy cloak!"
1062,"Claud: Is that so... Hm. Surely you're chilled to the bone, wearing as little as you are, though?"
1063,"Silvia: Oh, no! Even 'round here I'm never cold, 'cause my heart's ablaze!"
1064,Claud: Is dancing truly so fun for you?
1065,Silvia: Yeah! I just love it!
1066,Claud: Is that so... What of your parents? Do they agree with this career of yours?
1067,"Silvia: Actually, I'm an orphan. When I was really little, my master took me in and helped me become a dancer. But he... he was an awful, awful man. He'd always beat me outta nowhere. 'Bout a year ago I couldn't stand any more of it all, so I ran away."
1068,"Claud: I see... What a horrible tale. I believe I know your pain. I once had a sister, who would likely be around your age if she's still alive."
1069,Silvia: A sister?
1070,"Claud: Yes. Alas, she was abducted while she was still an infant. I've searched for her ever since, but to this day I've yet to find any sign of her."
1071,Silvia: Ohh... I bet she's just like a princess! She's gotta be all pretty and classy... And nothin' like me...
1072,"Claud: I disagree. I assure you, I do find you to be utterly charming. In your own way, you possess a unique grace and beauty."
1073,Silvia: Oh... mister Father... really?
1074,Claud: Of course. I could never lie.
1075,"Silvia: Th-thank you... Nobody's ever told me somethin' like that... This feels kinda funny somehow... Oh... Oh, great, now I'm cryin'... What is this...?"
1076,"Lewyn: Hey, Sigurd? Could I have a word?"
1077,"Sigurd: Ah, Lewyn. I'm so sorry about what happened to Annand. I had no idea Yngvi's bow knights would get involved in this mess."
1078,"Lewyn: No, it's not your fault. Just mine... I just haven't been thinking right lately. I should've been here all along, looking after Mother and the country. But nope, I just ran away! That's why Annand died... She just took my place in all this."
1079,"Sigurd: There's no need to blame yourself. The best you can do now is care for the queen, and ensure that Annand didn't die in vain."
1080,"Lewyn: Yeah, I know. No use pointing out the obvious, huh?"
1081,"Sigurd: Very well. Oh, Lewyn, before I forget... Don't forget to go see your mother at the capital as soon as possible. She said it's of the utmost importance!"
1082,Erinys: Lord Lewyn...
1083,"Lewyn: ...Oh, Erinys. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. Please..."
1084,"Erinys: Oh, you mean about Annand..."
1085,Lewyn: ...Yeah.
1086,"Erinys: Oh, so she... you really did... I'm so sorry. I had no idea."
1087,"Lewyn: Whoa, Erinys! You've got it all wrong. I guess when I was younger, I did sorta have a thing for Annand... But that was then. This is now, and the now is you."
1088,Erinys: C-come again?!
1089,"Lewyn: Erinys, I... I love you..."

1092,"Chapter 5: Doorway to Destiny
"
1093,"The Silessian civil war is over, and the Grannvale army awaits Sigurd. Zaxon Castle has barely fallen, yet before Sigurd can so much as rest, the hordes of Grannvale stand before him at the captured Lubeck Castle. The Grannvale commander, Duke Lombard, is a longtime enemy of Sigurd's father. For Sigurd, to challenge Lombard is an opportunity to avenge his father, Byron, framed by Lombard for his crimes. Beyond Lubeck, in the desert town Phinora, Lord Arvis's elite warriors stand guard under the command of the war-mage Vaja. Velthomer Castle, on Grannvale's border with the Aed Desert, is defended by Lord Arvis' trusted aide, General Aida. And in Belhalla, the royal capital of Grannvale, Lord Arvis serves to aid the bedridden King Azmur, while Chancellor Reptor of Friege maintains peace and order in the city. A long road to Belhalla awaits Sigurd... A clash with Grannvale en route is inevitable. Sigurd refuses to endanger the people of Silesse any further in this conflict. He is determined to fight to the end. The year is Grann 760, early spring. The fields of Silesse peacefully rest beneath a deep blanket of snow...
"
1094,"Sigurd Didn’t Talk to Byron (Lubeck Conquered)
"
1095,"And thus comes the end of an era. The path of Grannvale's great unrest, arising from the conflict with Isaach, has led one young man to his grim fate. His sorrowful tale, and those of countless other valiants, are now lost to the world. Many heroes lost their lives on this path... Quan, the prince of Leonster... Ethlyn, his wife... (Any units lost prior) And Sigurd, the young heir of Chalphy... And the names of those heroes who fought alongside Sigurd to the bitter end at Belhalla, whose fates remain unknown... (Any units still alive) These brave youths fought to change the world for the better, yet now their unfulfilled dreams lie dead with them on the battlefield... Was their sacrifice in vain? What were they fighting for all along? And what of the light...?

"
1097,"Byron: Nngh... Sigurd... ...No, I mustn't die yet... No... Not until the exalted blade is in your hands..."
1098,"Slayder: Milord, we've sighted the fugitive Duke Byron. We caught him resting, but he slipped away. It seems as if he plans to escape to Silesse."
1099,"Lombard: What?! You simpleton! Get out there and hunt him down, immediately! My ambush may have put an end to Chalphy's paladin brigade, the Grünritter, but the survival of Byron alone leaves that utterly meaningless!"
1100,"Slayder: Y-yes, sir... But you see, milord, Byron is still gravely wounded. Surely, he has very little time left..."
1101,"Lombard: I've never heard such naïve drivel! Byron may not be long for this world, but he's determined to get that sword, Tyrfing, to his son with the very last of his strength. Do you not understand the threat that Sigurd would pose to us, should he get his hands on that damnamble sword? Move out and kill Byron, immediately!"
1102,"Slayder: Y-yes, sir! Consider it done!"
1103,"Lombard: For that matter, where in blazes is Danann with those reinforcements?! For the gods' sake, he's leading the elite Grau Ritter brigade! How could it take him so long to put down that Isaachian resistance?! First Lex, and now Danann... Why must both of my sons be so worthless?!"
1104,"Andrey: Come now, Lord Lombard, sir! Don't worry about a thing. After all, you've still got the Beige Ritter and I on your side."
1105,"Lombard: I suppose you're right, Andrey. Be sure that your men are ready to join the fray at a moment's notice."
1106,"Andrey: Heh. It would be my pleasure, sir..."
1107,Lombard: Damn that insolent worm. To think he isn't even the slightest bit remorseful for slaying his own father! Duke Ring... May you be at peace...
1108,"Oifey: Sire! We've sighted a lone knight to our east, who appears to be headed our way."
1109,Sigurd: Hm? Is he an enemy?
1110,"Oifey: I don't believe so. The Lubeck occupation seems to be pursuing him, so they're most likely not with them."
1111,"Sigurd: I see. Let's give them a hand. We'll be clashing with Lombard's army sooner or later, so why not make the first move? Move out! Our target is their front lines. Today's victory hinges on this first strike!"
1112,Azmur: Lord Arvis... Are Sigurd and his party truly on the march to our holy capital?
1113,"Arvis: Indeed, but we've no cause for alarm. Duke Lombard and his army stands ready at Lubeck. It is only a matter of time before their insurrection is suppressed."
1114,"Azmur: Even so... Even now, it is almost beyond belief, is it not? That Lord Byron would slay Kurth... Or that Sigurd would incite a rebellion..."
1115,"Arvis: Your Majesty, if I may explain once more... Lord Byron was plotting against the crown in concert with the late Lord Ring of Yugvi. His Highness fell afoul of their assault, an act to which our very own Dukes Reptor and Lombard bore witness. His Highness learned of their schemes to seize the throne from the royal family too late, and paid for it with his life. Naturally, Lord Sigurd had a hand in his father's revolt. What clearer proof is there than how he still harbors an enemy, the Isaachian prince? There is no question. Their treason against the state is grave. I, too, feel this pain as my own, having lost not only a prince but a father-in-law... And in the name of my beloved wife, Princess Deirdre, I will never allow Sigurd's traitorous rampage to stand! Even if Duke Lombard fails to defeat him, that is not the end! The elite fire mages of House Velthomer, the Rot Ritter, stand ready to suppress this rebellion, once and for all!"
1116,"Azmur: I see... If you say it is so, then perhaps... Perhaps this could never have been avoided... Arvis, about... Cough! About Deirdre..."
1117,"Deirdre: Oh, Grandfather! Are you sure you feel all right? Please, you mustn't strain yourself! Come, lie down."
1118,"Azmur: Ah... Deirdre. Bless you... You truly are a sweet child. Even if I have little time left, you give me hope for Grannvale's future... I can scarcely imagine when Kurth would have had as fine a daughter as you... But there is no doubt in my mind. None outside the royal House Belhalla possess the same Brand that graces your brow. Whence did you come, my dear? Where in the world have you been all along..."
1119,"Deirdre: I'm so sorry, Grandfather... I simply don't remember. Try as I may, I cannot recall even a single thing..."
1120,"Azmur: Ah, forgive me, my dear... I know you have suffered more and long than any of us."
1121,"Arvis: From the moment I found her lost in the castle grounds, it was clear she had no memory of her past. All she knew was her own name. The rest of her past is lost to her. At first I sought only to aid her out of sympathy, as any decent man would do, but before long love took root within me... With all due respect, Deirdre, not once did I suspect that you could possibly be the daughter of our late Prince Kurth."
1122,"Azmur: I remember well the day you introduce her as the woman you wished to marry... I simply could not believe what I saw! At first sight... I knew, perhaps as only family can. Precisely as I thought, beneath your circlet lies the Brand of Naga. Lord Arvis, I trust you understand. Only a full-blooded heir to Saint Heim can rightfully wield the Book of Naga and release its true holy power. And the power of Naga is the only power able to oppose the dark lord, Loptous."
1123,"Arvis: I am well aware of the legend, sire."
1124,"Azmur: The holy lineage of our lord Naga and Saint Heim must never perish! Deirdre... You must bear a son with all due haste! And should your son be so fortunate as to inherit Naga's power... He shall be the Prince of Grannvale, and shall claim the throne once I am no more. Lord Arvis... until your son as grown into a man, you shall be his regent. Guide him well to adulthood. I trust you understand... Cough! Cough..."
1125,Sigurd: It can't be... F-Father?! Thank the gods! You're alive!
1126,Byron: Sigurd... What a splendid young man you've become... Cough! C-cough...
1127,"Sigurd: Father! Come on, you mustn't give in now!"
1128,"Byron: No... There's no hope left for me now... Listen well, my son. Lombard was Prince Kurth's true killer. And Reptor is the one holding his leash... His Majesty must know the truth! I... Death holds no fear for me. But I cannot die in peace not knowing if our honor shall be cleansed of these lies."
1129,"Sigurd: It's just as I thought all along... Rest assured, Father. Our good name will be cleared. I promise."
1130,"Byron: Sigurd, I... I beg your forgiveness... 'Tis my negligence which condemned you to these torments... Sigurd... Take this. It is Tyrfing... Our exalted blade..."
1131,"Sigurd: Tyrfing... But, Father! Surely you'll still need this..."
1132,"Byron: Take it, Sigurd. Use it to... restore our... honor..."
1133,Sigurd: F-Father! Hold on... Please! Father...
1134,Oifey: Sire...
1135,Sigurd: Why... Why in the world did he have to... Gah... Reptor! Lombard! Mark my words! You will pay dearly for all you've done!
1136,Andrey: I suppose it's our turn... Move out! Carve the terror of the Beige Ritter into the traitors' hearts!
1137,"Byron: Ahh… No… Sigurd!! Just one more step… Oh, why have the heavens forsaken me! (Dies)"
1138,"Oifey: That was quite the fierce bout, sire."
1139,"Sigurd: Mm. And to think, none of them were Grannvale's elite! Listen, Oifey, I need to ask something of you."
1140,"Oifey: Of course, sire. What is it?"
1141,"Sigurd: As I recall, the territory of Isaach should be very close to the north-east of Lubeck. From what I've heard, ever since Grannvale won the war, Isaach has been governed by Danann, Lombard's eldest son. But I'd wager his influence has yet to reach much of the country's span, so..."
1142,"Oifey: I beg your pardon, sire?! Are you seriously asking me to abandon you for safety, now of all times? No! I refuse! I will not leave you, sire! I'm here for you no matter what, till I draw my last breath!"
1143,"Sigurd: Oifey, listen... I know this is a huge imposition, but please. Just hear me out. I... I don't want to lose Seliph. He isn't even two years old yet! I can hardly fight with an infant in tow. Please, Oifey. Take care of Seliph. Take him and find refuge from this blasted war. I know I can trust you, Oifey. You are my only hope."
1144,"Oifey: Sire... I... Very well. I'll take Lord Seliph. I'll protect him, no matter what happens. That said, you have to promise me. Promise me that you'll come for us as soon as this war is over. I won't leave you if you can't promise that."
1145,Sigurd: Of course. I swear I'll come for the two of you.
1146,Oifey: Thank you...
1147,"Shannan: Hold it! I promised Deirdre that I'll look after Seliph no matter what! I won't hand him over to anyone, not even Oifey, until Deirdre says I can!"
1148,"Sigurd: Calm down, Shannan... I know you're still hurt about losing Deirdre, but this isn't helping. It's okay. He'll be fine with Oifey."
1149,"Shannan: No! I need to protect Seliph! And you're forgetting that the people of Isaach won't exactly be happy to see more Grannvaleans! Oifey alone won't last a minute there, but if I'm there it'll be okay. Who better to protect Seliph in Isaach than the prince of Isaach? Please... I promised her..."
1150,"Oifey: Now that he mentions it, sire, I would be a tad more at ease if Shannan was there as well. I know you're reluctant to involve one as young as Shannan in something so dangerous. But I think we can agree he's become a talented warrior. Not to mention, I'll need Shannan to secure the people's support."
1151,"Sigurd: Hm... I'm sorry to burden you more, Shannan, but please... Take care of Seliph for me."
1152,"Shannan: Okay! Leave it to me! I'm gonna keep getting stronger, and nobody'll ever hurt Seliph! I'll teach him all about Deirdre, but... I wonder how he'll take what happened..."
1153,"Oifey: I suppose we should get going, then. Farewell, sire. Take care of yourself. I pray victory and clemency find you as soon possible."
1154,"Sigurd: Thank you, Oifey. Be careful out there."
1155,"Oifey: Yes, sir!"
1156,"Sigurd: Seliph... I'm so sorry. Please, grow up safe and strong..."
1157,"Quan: Gentlemen, we've not much further to go. Keep giving it your best. Rumor has it that Sigurd's army should be moving south through the Aed Desert. If we keep this pace north, we should be able to rendezvous with them sooner or later."
1158,"Ethlyn: Quan, I'm so sorry I dragged you into this. You and your father were too generous sparing so many soldiers to help my brother, even though your father is presently so ill... But are you sure you're both willing to risk crossing a nation as all-powerful as Grannvale? The very thought is terrifying..."
1159,"Quan: Ethlyn, you know as well as I that Leonster, a nation built on the legacy of the Crusader Njörun, is far stronger than its size suggests. No matter what happens, I could never regret giving my all for a cause as just as Sigurd's. My father feels precisely the same way. There's nothing to worry about, Ethlyn. After all, I'm wielding none other than Gáe Bolg! I'll never fail with it at my side! Sigurd could certainly stand to have my aid."
1160,Ethlyn: I suppose you're right. He'd appreciate any help at this point...
1161,"Quan: Ethlyn, we'll be entering hostile territory very shortly. The enemy could ambush us at any moment, so..."
1162,"Ethlyn: Actually, Quan... I've been thinking this over quite a bit, and I'm coming with you after all. I'd like to see my brother again, and I simply can't abandon you now."
1163,"Quan: I can't allow that! I let you come with me solely because you promised to return home partway. To say nothing of Altena's presence! Look at her, a mere babe of three years curled up aslumber in her mother's lap. Should we be attacked, what then?"
1164,"Ethlyn: Why, I'd fight my hardest to protect her. Nobody could possibly seize her from me! I certainly never intended at first to take her with us. But she simply wouldn't stop crying when I tried to leave her behind. You're right, though... You're right. I'll take her home."
1165,"Quan: Ethlyn, I'm sorry. I assure you I do know precisely how you feel, but Leif is barely born and waiting for you at home. Our children need their mother. Please, Ethlyn. Return home. I left Finn to defend the capital. You'll be safe with him."
1166,"Ethlyn: Very well, but... I'd like just a little more time. I want to stay by your side a little longer. Please, Quan..."
1167,Quan: Ethlyn... Very well. We've a little more time to spare.
1168,"Travant: Hehehe... Ah, Quan! The poor sod still has no clue we're tailing him. And there's a woman with him? What a clumsy mistake. Why, I daresay this is the long-awaited end of Leonster's famous Lanceritter! Those hooves'll be sinking clean into the sand. They can't so much as flail at us. Men, close in! This is it! Thracia's destiny lies before us, ripe for the grasping!"
1169,"Quan: What? Thracian wyvern knights?! No... You cannot be serious! Travant has been at our heels all along! Ethlyn, run! We've no hope of victory in this blasted desert!"
1170,Ethlyn: But... What will you do?
1171,"Quan: They're like wild hyenas, Ethlyn! Children are little more than easy targets for them! Thracia has sought to reconquer our territory for centuries. I thought my absence would be taken as an invitation, so I left Finn behind with half the army in case they made the obvious move. Not once... Not even once did I ever suspect they would pursue US instead! I... This was all a mistake..."
1172,"Ethlyn: You can't give up now, Quan! It'll be okay. We're together, aren't we? At the very least, together we'll not go down easily!"
1173,"Quan: Ethlyn... Forgive me, please..."
1174,Arvis: I see. Duke Lombard fell in battle...
1175,"Reptor: A-Arvis! What are we supposed to do now?! It was you who insisted that, even if we left the bulk of our armies on conquests with our sons, Sigurd would pose no threat to me at all! The situation before us is not the outcome you promised me!"
1176,"Arvis: Reptor, your overreaction is baseless. The deck is still stacked in our favor. The Velthomer army is already lying in wait for the rebels in the Aed Desert's depths. Furthermore, Thracian sellswords should be arriving to reinforce us at any moment. The enemy will assuredly be exhausted. So long as my army and yours cooperate, Sigurd and his rebels ought to fall with ease."
1177,"Reptor: I'm holding you to your word this time, Arvis. Remember, I've no objection to you alone claiming the throne once Azmur finally dies. But don't you dare forget your allies..."
1178,"Arvis: Of course. Must I remind you? The instant the dust of this war settles, House Friege will be granted the Agustrian throne to govern. House Dozel, meanwhile, will be entrusted with the rule of Isaach. Rest assured, Reptor. I will honor your rights to these territories."
1179,"Reptor: Hrm... Very well. Then I, too, will fight with all I have..."
1180,"Manfroy: Kehehehehe... Greetings, Lord Arvis. The plan proceeds precisely on time, I see..."
1181,"Arvis: Manfroy... If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times... You must not show your face here. Until the Grannvale throne is mine, I cannot allow you or your brethren to appear in public. Do you not understand?"
1182,"Manfroy: Oh, we understand. We understand how you indulge the greed of men as vile as Reptor and Lombard. We understand how even then, you still will not concede the very fact of our existence. The plan was to use those two buffoons until they could be used no further, then cast them aside and use their sons in their stead... Was it not?"
1183,"Arvis: Mm, but... Hear me well, Manfroy. I refuse to have any part in the revival of your Loptyrian Empire. I've no desire to oppress your cult, but I've even less of a desire to consign the world to your dark lord's rule. Remember this well. Yes, the blood of Loptous' scions flows in my veins, but there is so much more to me than that. My Loptyrian heritage is that of Saint Maera, a man who fought for the rights of the people. And more importantly, I am the one true heir to the Crusader Fjalar, Loptous' sworn enemy. I will change this world for the better. Under my rule, humanity shall be free from the pain of prejudice, tyranny and oppression! What a pity it is, that Sigurd must die, but alas, all things require sacrifice."
1184,"Manfroy: Ohohoho... A sacrifice for the sake of the Lady Deirdre, you mean. You are terrified, Lord Arvis. You fear her memory may someday return..."
1185,Arvis: Don't you dare bring her into this! Need I remind you? We. Are. In. LOVE! Nothing will ever come between us!
1186,Manfroy: Heh heh heh... I suppose you two need to hasten and make proof of this love of yours. Proof that will one day grow up and rise to be a most magnificent king! Heh heh heh...
1187,"Vaja: The rebels are finally headed this way? Heh, excellent. Let them walk right into the range of my welcoming gift: Meteor spells! The desert will gladly claim their bodies!"
1188,"Travant: What's this? The woman was fool enough to have a child with her? Ah, I see... Quan's daughter. Interesting... You there! Tell Quan this: If he doesn't surrender Gáe Bolg, his daughter will meet an untimely end. Heh heh heh... Your move, Quan. Your move."
1189,"Quan: N-no! Altena... Ethlyn... So this is where it ends... Travant! You can have Gáe Bolg, but don't you DARE so much as scratch Altena!"
1190,"Travant: And so ends Quan... Magorn! You're in charge now. Head north and give Sigurd's army a fair share of grief. Let none of them escape. There's a fine bounty on each traitorous head, after all."
1191,"Magorn: Yes, Sir! Er, that said, what are we supposed to do with this child? She's just crying and crying. We don't know how to handle this. Shall I put her out of her misery, sir?"
1192,Travant: Certainly not. Hand her over to me. She and Gáe Bolg are coming with me back to Thracia.
1193,"Magorn: Can't say I expected this, sir. If I may, why exactly are you taking her home with you?"
1194,Travant: Moron! You've no need to know! Keep that mouth of yours out of business that isn't yours.
1195,"Magorn: Y-yes, sir. I beg your forgiveness, sir. By your leave, sir, we will pursue Sigurd's rebels."
1196,Travant: Good. Don't fail me.
1197,"Travant: The woman brought a child with her, did she? Ahh… Quan’s daughter. This is gettin’ good! Hand her over. I’m takin’ her an’ the Gáe Bolg back to Thracia with me."
1198,Magorn: This is unexpected. Why would you want to take her back to Thracia?
1199,Travant: Shut up! This ‘as got nothin’ t’do with ya! So keep yer trap shut.
1200,"Magorn: Ah, f, forgive me. I will… ah, lead the troops in pursuit of Sigurd then."
1201,"Travant: Yeah, ya do that!"
1202,Sigurd: Good. We've finally claimed Phinora. The fatherland is finally within our reach. Oifey and Shannan... I pray they and Seliph are faring well...
1203,"Old man: Lord Sigurd, I presume? Welcome to Phinora."
1204,"Sigurd: Ah, you must be the local elder. My apologies for dragging even an oasis town like Phinora into this godforsaken war."
1205,"Old man: Mm, at this point it was unavoidable. Actually, we've just received word of yet another skirmish in the desert's southern depths. Alas, we find ourselves in dangerous times..."
1206,"Sigurd: In the south, you say... What happened there?"
1207,"Old man: As we understand it, the lance knights of Leonster were on a march north. They were savaged by Thracian wyvern knights en route. There were no survivors, it seems."
1208,Sigurd: W-what?! You can't be serious!
1209,"Old man: I'm sorry to say I am. By the sound of it, there was a young girl in the Leonster party. Our hearts all break for the poor dear..."
1210,Sigurd: That's... that was Ethlyn and Quan... Forgive... forgive me...
1211,"Aida: Lord Reptor, we're depending upon you."
1212,Reptor: Of course. Even so... I cannot help but wonder if Arvis will honor his word. Perhaps... Perhaps we are nothing more than sacrifices to him.
1213,"Aida: Lord Arvis is hard at work making the final adjustments to the Velthomer battle plan. You've no need to worry, sire."
1214,"Reptor: Very well. I'll take you at your word, then."
1215,"Aida: Now, if you'll excuse me, sire. I must return to the helm of the Velthomer barricades."
1216,"Aida: Heh... He hasn't a clue, has he? Wretched fool..."
1217,"Reptor: This is it. Until Arvis is ready to move out, this battle is ours and ours alone. Hold to your positions until the enemy stumbles into our range. Do not move otherwise!"
1218,"Reptor: This is it. The time to strike is upon us! With the fire mages of Velthomer at our side, we shall crush the rebels in one fell swoop!"
1219,Aida: Execute the plan. Concentrate all of your fire on Reptor and his army. There will be no survivors under any circumstance. Am I clear?
1220,Reptor: W-what? Velthomer has turned on us?! Argh... So this is what Arvis planned all along...
1221,Aida: This is no time to talk! Please find me after we’ve subdued Reptor.
1222,"Aida: Ah, Lord Sigurd. I'm glad to see you're safe."
1223,Sigurd: What's going on? What's caused Velthomer's change of loyalties?
1224,"Aida: Lord Arvis has long been aware of your innocence, and was on your side all along. This affair in its entirety was dictated by the whims of Reptor and Lombard, architects of the conspiracy against you. Lord Arvis was unable to act until now, as the dukes' control of the royal court was simply too powerful to contravene."
1225,"Sigurd: Is that so... All's well that ends well, then. I can restore my father's good name in the court, and that'll be the end of it."
1226,"Aida: Indeed. Lord Arvis and His Majesty await your return in Belhalla, Lord Sigurd. Please, make your way to the royal city as soon as possible."
1227,"Sigurd: Really? Very well. I'll be going, then."
1228,"Aida: I hear that Lord Arvis arranged a ceremonial reception for you with the entirety of the Belhalla royal guard. Quite the magnificent celebration of your glorious return is in order today, it seems."
1229,"Sigurd: Thank you. After all that's happened the past few years, this ought to be a fitting conclusion. Once we're done I should look into getting my allies some compensation for their help. They certainly deserve it after all this!"
1230,"Aida: Indeed, sir..."
1231,"Arvis: Ah, Lord Sigurd. Truly, this is quite the auspicious day. Congratulations on your triumphant return to the fatherland!"
1232,"Sigurd: It's good to see you too, Lord Arvis, and thank you for such a lavish greeting! If I may ask, where is His Majesty?"
1233,"Arvis: Alas, His Majesty is taken severely ill. He has become permanently bedridden. As such, I am administering all affairs of state on his behalf for the time being."
1234,"Sigurd: Is that so? I'm sorry to hear that. I bet my misadventures didn't help His Majesty feel any better! Once we're finished here, I should visit the palace and give him my sincerest apologies."
1235,Arvis: ...I think not.
1236,Sigurd: Hm?
1237,"Arvis: Sigurd of Chalphy, I hereby sentence you to death for your crimes of treason. His Majesty will not be seeing you, today or ever."
1238,"Sigurd: W-what?! What are you talking about, Lord Arvis?!"
1239,"Arvis: Heh... You are only realizing now? You are far too naïve, Sigurd. Need I remind you that you and your father still sought to usurp the throne and plotted against the crown? Nothing has changed. It is my duty to exact justice upon you, in the name of my wife, Princess Deirdre. I trust you understand, Sigurd."
1240,"Sigurd: P-Princess Deirdre?! That... No, it can't be..."
1241,"Arvis: Ah, of course. You've never met, correct? Very well. I suppose an introduction would be a fair parting gift before your demise. Come, Deirdre! Greet our guests!"
1242,"Arvis: Deirdre, allow me to introduce you to Sigurd: the spawn of your father's murderer, Byron. I trust you have some choice words for him?"
1243,Deirdre: So... So this is... Sir Sigurd?
1244,Sigurd: Deirdre?! No... This can't be happening...
1245,Deirdre: Why... Why are you speaking like this...?
1246,"Sigurd: Deirdre! It really is you! No... No, no, no..."
1247,"Deirdre: Do... Do you know me, sir?"
1248,Sigurd: OF COURSE I DO! YOU'RE MY-
1249,"Arvis: Enough! Deirdre, stand clear. This is an extremely dangerous man. Rest assured: this traitor will be punished."
1250,Deirdre: But... He... He's... Can't we have even a little more time?
1251,Arvis: Unacceptable. Guards! Escort the princess to the castle!
1252,"Deirdre: Wait! Arvis, please! ...Just a little more time..."
1253,"Sigurd: W-wait! DEIRDRE! Arvis, please! I beg of you! She... She's my..."
1254,"Arvis: Enough! I grow weary of your ravings. Attention, men! We no longer have any use for keeping the traitors alive. Move in on Sigurd and his party! The time to serve them their punishment has come!"
1255,"Sigurd: ...D... DAMN YOU, ARVIS!!"
1256,"Arden: Heh… I got married and got a kid! My family’s gotta come first, so I best not be dyin’. What’s dis ole book sittin’ here. Hmph… Dis is all gibber gabber. Eerrrr… mmmmnugh! What da… Wow! I feel all my senses done renovated!"
1257,"Villager: Grannvale’s military went and seized Lubeck, did they? Ahh! Silesse’s days’re numbered."
1258,Villager: Our Silesse remained peaceful for the longest time. Just when did things get so bad…
1259,"Villager: Children inherit certain traits from their parents. More often than not, boys inherit their father’s traits and girls inherit their mother’s."
1260,"Villager: Lombard’s soldiers are looting all the villages! But we managed to sneak a little cash past them. Here, we would like you to have it."
1261,"Villager: Grannvale did subdue Isaach, but there still is some commotion going on over there. Apparently the people of Isaach are desperate to see Prince Shannan return."
1262,"Villager: Grannvale used to be a peace loving country, but things have changed. They’ve been sending troops to each and every nation with the intention of overthrowing them. Prince Kurth would never have allowed any of this if he were around. Please do something! Please return to Grannvale and remove those who are responsible for all this!"
1263,"Villager: By the sounds of it, the late King Eldigan of Nordion and his queen had themselves a young boy. His name was Ares, I believe. I reckon he’d be about 3 or 4 by now. Poor thing."
1264,"Edain: Is something wrong, Brigid?"
1265,"Brigid: Oh, Edain. You heard about what Andrey's been up to lately, right?"
1266,"Edain: I did. I've heard of how he murdered our father, and later Annand died in Silesse as well... I can barely imagine the evil which would have possessed him to do such monstrous things."
1267,"Brigid: ...I'm going to kill Andrey. There's no other way. Whatever the evil is, he has to be stopped. Right here, right now. You get what I'm saying, right, Edain?"
1268,Edain: Brigid...
1269,"Brigid: Andrey's crimes are House Yugvi's crimes. They're our crimes, too. They reflect badly on us, even though they really shouldn't. I know I'll have his blood on my hands for the rest of my life, but... Edain, I want you to understand."
1270,"Edain: Of course I do, Brigid..."
1271,"Claud: Edain, this is to be our last battle."
1272,"Edain: Yes, that’s what everyone’s saying."
1273,"Claud: Here, you should have this. Help our young soldiers with it."
1274,"Edain: Oh, this is a Rescue Staff. Why me?"
1275,"Claud: I have yet to speak a word of this, but you being my wife, well… I should probably tell you. This war will end in our defeat. All that is important to us will be lost."
1276,Edain: …What!?
1277,"Claud: I, too, had a difficult time believing the Lord’s words when I was at Bragi Tower. But this is how fate will have it. I also will not likely survive. That’s why I’m entrusting this staff to you."
1278,Edain: That can’t be true! I don’t believe any of what you’re saying!! Please… tell me it’s not true!
1279,"Claud: Edain, there’s really nothing to be scared of. My death is really just a new beginning. As life embraces death, that with form is lost, yet something still remains. There’s nothing to fear in death. It is merely a transition to a more perfect form."
1280,Edain: But Claud…!
1281,"Claud: Just as I am to die, I shall also be reborn. Look, inside of you is a brand new life and I am a part of it. And that is why you must keep living."
1282,Edain: How could you! You tell me to keep living while you…
1283,"Claud: Edain, I have been blessed to have met you. Forgive me if I have sounded insensitive."
1284,Edain: Claud…
1285,Sigurd: Hold on... Ayra?! Why are you still here? Didn't I task you with accompanying Shannan and Oifey to Isaach?
1286,"Ayra: You did, but I feel I'd always regret abandoning your army at such a crucial hour. I'm with you until the end, Sigurd."
1287,"Sigurd: I don't believe this... If you're not going, how are you supposed to protect Shannan?"
1288,"Ayra: Ah, of course. My pledge to my late brother... Shannan has grown into a strong young man, capable of leading his own life. My work is done. He no longer needs my protection."
1289,Sigurd: But-
1290,"Ayra: Once I've seen this war through, I'll return to his side in Isaach. Until then, Sigurd, I won't run away. For better or worse, I'm with you."
1291,"Lex: Geez, Azel, you look awful! What's going on?"
1292,"Azelle: Oh, Lex... Why are you looking so happy?"
1293,"Lex: Huh? Oh, right. My dad..."
1294,Azelle: Mm...
1295,"Lex: Yeah... I'm gonna be honest, Azelle. It's not that I feel nothing at all about what happened. Can't be helped, right? But after all the pain and suffering Dad caused... Well, he deserved to go down."
1296,"Azelle: Oh... You know, I've always admired you for your resilience, Lex. Just thinking about my brother is enough to make me tremble."
1297,"Lex: Yeah, Arvis has always struck me as quite an odd one, but he's always been a decent fellow. I still can't see him as our enemy..."
1298,"Azelle: I know... Arvis has always been like a father to me, and I never knew my real father. The problem is, sometimes he just... He just changes! It's as if he becomes a whole different man. That's why I..."
1299,"Lex: That's why you up and left him behind at home, right? There's nothing wrong with that, Azelle. He's got his life, and you've got yours. Don't beat yourself up abut it, okay?"
1300,Azelle: I suppose you're right...
1301,Dew: Hey... Jamke?
1302,"Jamke: Dew? Still here, are you? Look, didn't you hear us the first time? You're just in the way now. Go on, get outta here!"
1303,"Dew: Ugh, why's everyone sayin' that?! What is WITH you lot lately? We're so close to winnin' this thing, but you wouldn't know it from how you're all actin'! What's goin' on here?"
1304,"Jamke: Oh, er, sorry... You're right. I guess I am a bit tense at the moment. Not sure why, though..."
1305,"Dew: ...Look, Jamke. You're a neat guy and I like you. I know I've kinda been a pain in the neck right from the start and... Er, sorry."
1306,"Jamke: Huh? Why're you so sappy all of a sudden? If anyone's being weird now, it's you!"
1307,"Dew: Er, well, I kinda... Never mind. I guess I'll see ya later."
1308,Jamke: Huh... Even Dew can tell something's not right here...
1309,"Alec: Naoise, this is it, huh?"
1310,Naoise: Mmm.
1311,"Alec: Hey, uh… I just wanna thank you for everything."
1312,"Naoise: Sure thing. Same goes here, Alec."
1313,"Alec: It’s been a blast, huh?"
1314,Naoise: Yep.
1315,"Alec: Well, take care then."
1316,Naoise: Yep. You too.
1317,"Tailtiu: Azelle, don’t go!"
1318,"Azelle: Tailtiu, you promised me you’d head for Silesse. I told you, I’ll come as soon as I can!"
1319,Tailtiu: But…
1320,"Azelle: You can’t fight Friege’s army! What, are you going to kill your own father?"
1321,"Tailtiu: Well, no, but…"
1322,"Azelle: Good. I’d have second thoughts about someone who’d kill their own dad. You take care of the kids, okay?"
1323,Tailtiu: …Azelle!
1324,"Tailtiu: Claud, what do you think I should do?"
1325,"Claud: Fighting the Friege army is out of the question. I don't believe engaging your own father in battle is at all advisable. Please, go to Silesse. There is still a safe, peaceful life awaiting you there."
1326,"Tailtiu: But what about you, Claud?"
1327,"Claud: I have an obligation, Tailtiu. My fate is to stay here and see this war through till its very end."
1328,Tailtiu: How can you be so cruel? Wh... What about our children?!
1329,"Claud: I understand how difficult this fate will be for you, but please... Please understand."
1330,Tailtiu: Claud!!
1331,"Tailtiu: Lex, you just have t’fight, don’t ya."
1332,Lex: Hey! You get to Silesse where you’ll be safe.
1333,Tailtiu: You’re so cruel! You want me t’go all alone.
1334,"Lex: Hey, everyone in the Friege family is breakin’ their back lookin’ for you, girl. And I don’t want my kids goin’ with them or the Dozels. You understand me!?"
1335,"Tailtiu: Yeah, but…"
1336,"Lex: Look, we’ve both been dealt a crappy hand. I wish we could’ve been together longer. I will cherish every single moment we had."
1337,"Tailtiu: Oh, Lex…"
1338,"Erinys: We've nearly reached the end, Lewyn."
1339,"Lewyn: Mm. But don't go forgetting that promise you made, Erinys."
1340,"Erinys: Of course. I'm to return to Silesse, no matter what happens."
1341,"Lewyn: Trust me, I'm not planning on dying out here. You're not going to die any time soon, either!"
1342,"Erinys: Of course! I promise... Being with you... It's as if all my childhood dreams have come true! I'm not going to just die and waste that. I'll always be with you, Lewyn. Always. No matter what."
1343,"Lewyn: Mother's still waiting for us back in Silesse... Hell, she's probably waiting for YOU more than anything else!"
1344,"Erinys: Heh... I hope that Queen Lahna... Wait, no. That Mother will be proud of me!"
1345,"Erinys: Arden, you okay?"
1346,Arden: I’ve had ‘nough of dis stupid desert!
1347,Erinys: Heheh! Too bad you can’t ride my pegasus with me out of here.
1348,Arden: Yeh. If only I’s ’bout a hunnerd pounds lighter.
1349,"Erinys: Arden, don’t you get yourself killed, okay?"
1350,Arden: You can bet on dat! I ain’t dyin’. Not after gettin’ someone as perdy as you for my wife! When dis war’s done wit we’s headin’ back t’Silesse. We can open a little veggie stand!
1351,"Erinys: Yes, that would be just fine with me."
1352,"Erinys: Oh, Naoise, I’ve been looking for you!"
1353,"Naoise: Erinys, you alright?"
1354,Erinys: I’m fine.
1355,"Naoise: Good. Erinys, you be careful. You’re no longer caring for just yourself, you know."
1356,"Erinys: I hope our kids back in Silesse are doing okay, as well. I’m dying to see them again."
1357,"Naoise: Yep, me too. Let’s get this war over with quickly."
1358,"Erinys: Yes, let’s do that. Naoise, you be careful, too."
1359,"Silvia: Claud, you okay?"
1360,"Claud: Yes, I’m fine. But you cannot stay here. Now get going!"
1361,Silvia: But…
1362,Claud: You can’t stay with us. It’s too dangerous!
1363,"Silvia: …Claud, I love you."
1364,"Claud: I love you too, but…"
1365,Silvia: No! I’m not goin’. No way I’m leavin’ your side!
1366,"Claud: Silvia, I can’t allow that! Please understand."
1367,"Silvia: Say, Lewyn..."
1368,"Lewyn: Hm? What is it, Silvia?"
1369,"Silvia: Do ya still like me, Lewyn?"
1370,Lewyn: What? Where'd THAT come from?!
1371,"Silvia: Well, do ya?"
1372,"Lewyn: Of course I still love you! That's why we're married, remember?"
1373,"Silvia: Oh... 'Course. Whew. Be... Because I love you too, Lewyn... I'll never forget ya... And I don't want ya to forget me..."
1374,Lewyn: Silvia...
1375,"Silvia: Oh, there y'are, Alec!"
1376,"Alec: Silvia? Aw, geez! You shouldn't still be out here! Just go back to the castle! Please?"
1377,"Silvia: But I'm really worried 'bout ya, Alec..."
1378,"Alec: Listen, Silvia. You've gotta act a bit less like a child. C'mon, you're a mother now!"
1379,"Silvia: Not like you're one to talk on that one! That part's your fault too, remember?"
1380,"Alec: Y-yeah, I guess..."
1381,"Silvia: Look, Alec, you've gotta come back from this thing, okay? Without ya, I don't think Lene and me'll last... Promise? Please?"
1382,"Alec: Siliva... Yeah, I promise. I'm coming home from this one..."
1383,Lachesis: Beowolf...
1384,"Beowolf: Look, Lachesis. If somethin' happens t'me, I want ya to go to Leonster fer me. Quan's kids're there with Finn. Help 'em out where I can't, yeah?"
1385,"Lachesis: No! You mustn't say such things! If I go to Leonster, you will come with me!"
1386,Beowolf: Lachesis... I don't think I've done right by ya.
1387,Lachesis: W-what? Why...?
1388,Beowolf: I knew how ya really felt all along...
1389,Lachesis: ...Oh!
1390,"Beowolf: Look after yerself, Lachesis. This was fun while it lasted."
1391,Lachesis: Wait! Beowolf!!
1392,"Lachesis: Naoise, wait!"
1393,Naoise: Lachesis? You’re still here!? I told you to leave for Leonster.
1394,"Lachesis: I sent the kids already, but I’m staying to fight."
1395,"Naoise: Why are you breaking your word with me? The kids need their mother. What if something were to happen to you? And you have King Eldigan’s child to consider, too."
1396,Lachesis: I don’t know where Ares is anymore.
1397,"Naoise: Well, Sir Sigurd is very concerned about Prince Ares. That boy has lost both of his parents. Ares must mean something to you, as well."
1398,"Lachesis: No, it’s just… Ah, nevermind. Look, I am your wife."
1399,"Naoise: I know you are, and I love you dearly. Don’t you ever forget it."
1400,Lachesis: I won’t. Sorry.
1401,"Lachesis: Dew, what are you doing here!?"
1402,Dew: What gives? I can handle bein’ here now. I’m not the same Dew anymore.
1403,"Lachesis: I know. But this next battle isn’t going to be like the others! It’ll be way out of your league, Dew."
1404,Dew: Everyone’s been sayin’ that crap. I’m not a kid anymore!
1405,"Lachesis: I can definitely vouch for that, Dew. Heheh… Especially after what we…"
1406,"Dew: H, hey! You’re gettin’ red there, girl!"
1407,"Lachesis: Oh, Dew!"
1408,"Dew: Lachesis, it’s been great bein’ with you. You’re always nice to me."
1409,"Lachesis: Same goes to you, Dew."
1410,"Ayra: I guess we're nearing the end here, Lex."
1411,"Lex: Yeah... Y'know, Ayra, your stubbornness never ceases to amaze. Why didn't you just leave for Isaach?"
1412,Ayra: Why should I have? Because I'm a woman?! Why didn't you leave? You're every bit as responsible for the children as I am!
1413,"Lex: Yeah, you're right... Sorry about that. But I dunno... I'm still not sure we should've abandoned the kids like that."
1414,"Ayra: That's why, the instant this war is over, we'll go back to Isaach for them. Together."
1415,"Lex: Fair enough. C'mon, let's get this over with!"
1416,Ayra: Lex... I'm sorry about all that. I've always been a fighter. This is the only life I have.
1417,"Lex: Hah! It's fine, Ayra. I know. That's what I love about you, isn't it? I have no idea how this thing'll play out, but we're in it together, no matter what."
1418,"Ayra: Heh... Thank you, Lex."
1419,"Ayra: Chulainn, things are coming to a peak, aren’t they."
1420,Chulainn: Uh…
1421,"Ayra: Chulainn, I’ve got something I want to ask you. Is that alright?"
1422,"Chulainn: Yeah, what is it?"
1423,Ayra: Why do you look out for me? Is there something you haven’t told me?
1424,"Chulainn: Ayra, I’ve known you since I was a kid. Keeping you safe means everything to me."
1425,"Ayra: Eh!? Chulainn… Hey, you weren’t that boy from…"
1426,"Chulainn: Yep. I’m the son of the lord of Sophara. You stole my heart at a tender young age, Ayra."
1427,"Ayra: Arden, you alright?"
1428,Arden: Whew… I’m beat. This armor’s dang heavy.
1429,Ayra: Heh! But you look very manly. I like that about you.
1430,Arden: Oh! That’s nice of ya t’say. I like you for bein’ all womanly like.
1431,Ayra: Me? Womanly? That’s almost funny.
1432,"Arden: Yeah well, I think so at least. You’re the perdiest girl I can think of."
1433,"Ayra: Arden, are you sick or something?"
1434,"Arden: I might as well just blurt it out… Ayra, I love you."
1435,Ayra: What’s that!?
1436,"Brigid: Alec, we’re almost to Belhalla."
1437,"Alec: Yeah. This is our grand return, huh."
1438,Brigid: I wonder if I’ll be okay returning to the country I was born in. What is Yugvi like?
1439,Alec: Ahh… it’s a beautiful place with loads of beautiful women.
1440,Brigid: Alec! I better not catch you cheating on me!
1441,Alec: No way! You’d kill me if I did! Haha…
1442,"Brigid: That’s right! Besides, I want to keep you alive now. Your work with me has just begun! And for our children as well… I can’t let you die!"
1443,"Alec: Don’t worry, I’ve got luck on my side. How else could I get such a beautiful bride!"
1444,Brigid: Alec…
1445,"Brigid: You holding up okay, Jamke? Bet you're getting tired."
1446,"Jamke: Yeah, I'm doing fine. And you?"
1447,"Brigid: Yeah, 'cause I've got you at my side..."
1448,"Jamke: Are you sure I can't persuade you to escape, Brigid? I'm still not comfortable with you fighting in this mess of a battle."
1449,"Brigid: Oh, yeah. Dead sure, Jamke. Do you really still have to ask? You'd think I'd have made my point by now."
1450,Jamke: Right...
1451,Brigid: Jamke... You sure you're happy with me?
1452,Jamke: Hm?
1453,Brigid: Are you happy with me? I sorta know what you were like about Edain...
1454,"Jamke: Oh, come on. This again? You're the one I love, Brigid. You're the one I want to spend the rest of my life with."
1455,"Brigid: S-sorry about that... Still glad I asked, though..."
1456,"Brigid: Midir, are you alright?"
1457,"Midir: Yes, I’m fine. How are you doing, Brigid?"
1458,Brigid: I’m fine as long as you’re with me.
1459,"Midir: Brigid, I’m very happy I met you and I appreciate everything you’ve done for me."
1460,"Brigid: Midir, you sound like you want to break up or something."
1461,"Midir: Ah, forgive me. Brigid, I wanted you to understand something."
1462,"Brigid: Look, Midir. I know you used to like Edain. Do you think you’ll be happy with me?"
1463,"Midir: Of course! Yes, I used to like Edain… Like. But you are the only one I’ve ever loved."
1464,"Brigid: Midir, thanks! Don’t ever leave me."

1468,"Chapter 6: Inheritors of Light
"
1469,"The final battle for control of Grannvale sent its most powerful figures to the grave. Just as he had planned, this left Arvis as the sole ruling power of the kingdom. Opposition from Silesse and Leonster was swiftly crushed, and so Arvis unified all Jugdral under Grannvale's rule. With overwhelming support from his subjects, Arvis thus became the first Emperor of the Grannvale Empire. Seventeen years have passed since the Battle of Belhalla... The adoring public who once welcomed the rise of Emperor Arvis now struggle under his oppressive, dictatorial rule. And across Jugdral, in the other realms now dominated by Grannvale, their people have been reduced to living as little more than slaves to the Empire's whims. In the former Kingdom of Isaach, Grannvale's harsh rule tortures the Isaachian people. King Danann, the appointed king of Isaach, is a brutal and unforgiving tyrant, just like his late father, Duke Lombard. While Danann himself lives an indulgent life at the Rivough palace, the people remain little more than slaves to the Empire. His second son, Iuchar, rules Isaach Castle, while his youngest, Iucharba, rules Sophara. And the remote Ganeishire region is governed by Danann's trusted confidant, General Harold. Under their rule, Isaach knows no freedom... However, one last hope remains for Isaach. Tirnanog, an isolated village in Isaach's far north... There, Prince Shannan works to raise a liberation army, whose strength grows with each passing day. Among these proud, young warriors is a young man, dubbed the ""Scion of Light"" by the people of Isaach and revered as the rightful prince of the Grannvale Empire. He is the brave young leader of the liberation army. His name is Seliph.

1470,"Turn 3 – Player Phase
"
1471,"Danann: Harold! Have you ferreted out the rebels yet? Or are you content to leave them unchecked for the rest of their days?! Shannan and his rebel ilk are growing stronger by the day, now they hamper us at every turn! And as if that wasn't enough, they harbor the spawn of Sigurd the Traitor! The very existence of this scum utterly defiles the authority of the Isaachian throne! How do you expect me to explain this sorry state to His Imperial Majesty?"
1472,"Harold: A thousand apologies, Your Highness, but everything is already under control. The rebel hideout has been found, and even as we speak an army is on its way to crush them. Those vile mice have nowhere else to run! By sundown, not a single rebel will still be breathing."
1473,"Danann: Hm. Very well. But be warned, Harold. Don't even think of underestimating them. Most of the rebels are too young to pose a threat, but they still have Oifey and Shannan. Those two alone are extremely dangerous. Dismissing them would be a fatal mistake."
1474,"Harold: Yes, sir. I'm aware. But I've already had Tirnanog, the rebel hideout, surveyed in secret, and it appears that neither are anywhere in sight. It's safe to assume them to be currently absent, sir."
1475,Danann: What?! Then why are we still talking about this? Send the order to move in on Tirnanog immediately! The people of Isaach are treating these rebels like some kind of heroes of freedom... But it's high time they learned the error of their ways! Kill them! All of them! I'll be waiting back at Rivough. I expect nothing but good news!
1476,"Scáthach: We have a problem, Lord Seliph! Looks like the Empire's finally caught onto our whereabouts... A brigade's set out from Ganeishire, and they seem to be headed our way!"
1477,"Larcei: Ugh, Scáthach! Why so surprised? Did you really think our little hideout wouldn't be found out sooner or later? Let them come, I say! It only makes the battle easier for us! It's the easiest thing to just walk right over Ganeishire and pick them off as we go!"
1478,"Scáthach: You've gotta be kidding! Prince Shannan's still off trying to find the Aed Shrine, and Oifey and the others aren't back yet. It's just us two against an entire army! Surely, even you can't think this'll end well!"
1479,"Larcei: I don't care! You can sit here and be as scared witless as you want, but I'm not letting a chance like this pass! The prince still treats us like helpless children, but come on! We've had more than enough training! We're ready for real action!"
1480,Scáthach: But...
1481,"Larcei: I'm... I'm not gonna run away anymore! I'm sick to death of sitting here while those monsters butcher our friends! Or worse... The empire's thugs are still out there, snagging any girl they see... If Prince Shannan hadn't come for me that day, I'd be just another one of 'em: dead, or wishing I was... I won't forgive or forget their plan!"
1482,"Scáthach: No, that's not it, Larcei... You're right, it's horrible and all, but..."
1483,"Seliph: You're wary of engaging the enemy out of concern for my safety, aren't you Scáthach? Most likely, I presume Shannan would have given you strict orders to keep me safe. After all, if Shannan had not given such an order, you'd already be out there in the fray! To not be thirsting for a good battle just isn't the Scáthach I know."
1484,"Larcei: Oh... That's... That's right. Sorry, sir. I was hoping we didn't have to involve you..."
1485,"Seliph: I'm no child anymore, either, Larcei! If you two plan to fight, then I plan to fight by your side. There's more at stake today than only the resistance. What of Tirnanog? We owe so much to its people. I refuse to abandon them at such a critical hour!"
1486,Scáthach: But-
1487,"Seliph: We've no time to waste debating this! Lana, stay behind and help the citizens. We'll engage the foe in the western gully."
1488,"Lana: Wait, milord! I'm coming, too!"
1489,"Seliph: I cannot permit that, Lana! A cleric such as yourself is ill suited for such a battlefield."
1490,"Lana: This is my fight, too! You won't convince me any more than you could convince Larcei! Every day I think the Empire can't get any more cruel, and every day I'm proven wrong. They prey on the weak and vulnerable as if snuffing out their lives is a sport to them... I can't sit quietly and accept this! I may not be able to fight, but I've my own way of defending everyone!"
1491,"Seliph: Hm... My apologies, Lana. You are absolutely right: the battle for Isaach's freedom rests upon all of us. Very well. We shall all go together! How this will turn out, I cannot say... But we owe it to all of Isaach to give this battle no less than our best."
1492,"Lana: Yes, milord! And er... Sorry. I shouldn't have spoken so brashly."
1493,"Seliph: Ha! You've nothing to apologize for. Now, Scáthach, Larcei, Lana... The time has come! Move out!"
1494,Oifey: We're too late! The battle has already begun...
1495,"Lester: I guess news of Tirnanog, Seliph and all that must've leaked while we were off scouting. I hope everyone's doing alright..."
1496,"Diarmuid: Most of them'll be fine, Lester. But what about your sister? What if Lana's gone and gotten herself mixed up in the fighting? She can't defend herself at all if she's out in the open like this. Sir, we should hurry back. The sooner get back to Lord Seliph's side, the better."
1497,"Oifey: Indeed. Come, Lester! Diarmuid! The battlefield awaits us!"
1498,Seliph: By the gods! I've never seen such ruin. It's as if Ganeishire never even existed...
1499,"Lewyn: Been a while, hasn't it, Seliph?"
1500,"Seliph: Hm? Oh, Lewyn! Er, pardon me... Your Majesty, King Lewyn of Silesse..."
1501,"Lewyn: Just Lewyn, Seliph... like I've always been. Silesse is just another Imperial conquest now... That's all it's been since the mess in Belhalla. And meanwhile, here I am, still living a pathetic, shameful life for all to see. At least my mother faced Silesse's demise, and her own, with pride and dignity! But me? Nope! I'm still just an idiot bard... Don't listen to what Oifey says of me, Seliph. Just, please... don't call me a king ever again!"
1502,"Seliph: I... My apologies, Lewyn..."
1503,"Lewyn: Heh, it's fine. Don't worry about it. More importantly, looks like you've finally got this revolution thing started! There's no place more fitting than Isaach to start fighting back against the Empire."
1504,Seliph: Indeed! The courage of Isaach's people is matched only by the pain and anger the Empire has inflicted upon them. All we're missing now is for Prince Shannan to return and join the fray himself.
1505,"Lewyn: He ran off to follow some rumor, didn't he?"
1506,"Seliph: Mm. Rumor has it his birthright as heir to the Isaach throne, the holy sword Balmung, is being kept in a shrine in the Aed Desert. As I understand it, the entire desert region is ruled by an evil priest. I trust Shannan's might, but I cannot help but worry for his safety..."
1507,"Lewyn: Eh, if anyone can do it, it'll be Shannan. Actually, Seliph, I've a favor to ask of you."
1508,"Seliph: Oh? If it is within my power, I'll gladly help. What is it?"
1509,"Lewyn: Julia, could you come over here?"
1510,"Lewyn: See, I found her years ago in Belhalla when she was just a little girl, hurt pretty badly. Since then I've been looking after her in a hidden little corner of Silesse, at least until we had to get out a while back as the Empire set about tightening its grip. The thing is, I've got things that need doing over in Leonster, and at this point, she's just slowing me down."
1511,"Lewyn: I hate to impose on you, Seliph, but I don't have much of a choice. Could I just leave her with your group for a while? I still don't know what happened to her, but it must've been pretty awful. Poor thing. Back when I first found her, she couldn't remember a thing about what happened. It looks like she still can't..."
1512,"Seliph: I see... Very well. You can trust me with her, Lewyn. However, I must ask that you return for her as soon as possible. She likely won't feel too comfortable in an army of strangers."
1513,"Lewyn: Deal. Heh, I'll probably be back here by the time you've finished freeing Isaach. Good luck, Seliph."
1514,"Seliph: May the gods be with you as well, Lewyn!"
1515,"Seliph: Listen, Julia... I know it'll be hard for you without Lewyn here, but I promise you'll be alright. Until Lewyn returns, I swear I'll let no harm come to you... I know I've still much to learn, and as yet I'm not all that strong... But one day... Someday, I know I'll be strong enough to protect us all! Someday, I'll have the strength to defend all the world's people from the Empire's wrath! Someday I'll be strong, as my father once was..."
1516,Julia: Lord Seliph...
1517,"Danann: The rebels have taken over Ganeishire? Gah! Harold, you moron! What in the blazes are my sons doing? Somebody tell them to take the rebels down! Now!"
1518,"Iucharba: Dad's ordering us to attack, huh? Isn't Larcei in that army?! Damn... What do I do? How can I fight her..."
1519,"Iuchar: We're to strike Ganeisire, are we? My, my... Father's got quite the temper. But I could never lay so much as a finger on Larcei, even if she is among my foes... Ahh... What a dilemma standing before me..."
1520,"Fee: Phew! Sorry, Annand! I know a load like this isn't easy on you."
1521,Arthur: Hah! Annand? Is that really what you call your pegasus?
1522,"Fee: Oh, pipe down, Arthur. I don't care if we're nearly there, 'cause I'll still just dump you if you don't shut it!"
1523,"Arthur: Er, right. Sorry about that. Say, Fee, I don't have too far to go. If you want, I can just walk from here."
1524,"Fee: Where are you off to, anyway?"
1525,"Arthur: Oh, just Ulster."
1526,"Fee: U-Ulster?! Geez, you're dumber than I thought! Ulster's waaay south of here. There's an entire sea in the way, for crying out loud! I dunno what you're thinking, but you haven't got a hope in heck of walking the rest of the way there!"
1527,"Arthur: Eh, it's fine. I'm hardly in a hurry."
1528,"Fee: So, er, why do you need to go to Ulster?"
1529,"Arthur: Oh, see, I've got a sister I haven't seen in years who might be there. She and my mom were taken away when I was just a kid. I was sort of left alone in some far corner of Silesse or another. I just heard a rumor, but at this point even a rumor's enough if it means I might find her."
1530,"Fee: Huh, really? Y'know just what that's like. My big brother's been missing for ages."
1531,Arthur: Did you get separated from him as well?
1532,"Fee: Oh no, nothing that bad. We've always lived together in Silesse, but a while back he ran off to try and find our dad."
1533,"Arthur: Your father, huh?"
1534,"Fee: Yeah, he's been missing for years. Mom spent the rest of her life waiting for him to come back, but he never did..."
1535,Arthur: What happened to her?
1536,Fee: She... She's dead. Illness...
1537,"Arthur: Oh, er... Sorry about that. I shouldn't have brought it up..."
1538,"Fee: It's okay! I mean, you've already brought up lots of things that you shouldn't have. Heh, kidding. You're actually not that bad."
1539,"Arthur: Heh heh, thanks. And thanks for giving me a chance and letting me come along."
1540,Fee: No problem! So was the sister thing real? Is that actually why you're travelling?
1541,"Arthur: Yeah, it's real. But what about you? What's your deal?"
1542,"Fee: Actually, I kinda want to join that Isaachian rebel army. When I was little, mom told me stories about the paladin Sigurd and his brave allies, and those have always meant a lot to me. Lately I've been hearing about how Sigurd's son's somewhere in Isaach, raising a revolution. And it all just sort of clicked, y'know? I knew that's where I need to be, so I just ran right out of home to try and find him."
1543,"Arthur: Wow... That's pretty great of you. Y'know, I think I'll help you out here for a while. It's the least I can do for you putting up with me."
1544,"Fee: Okay! Partners it is, then! Good luck out there... partner!"
1545,"Arthur: Heh! Upbeat as ever, aren't you?"
1546,"Fighter: Lord Iucharba has some weird tastes. Lusting after such a fierce broad? Really? Heh... I prefer my women a little more... Wait, why am I telling you this?!"
1547,Initiator: ...
1548,"Axe Knight: Ugh... I don't get Lord Iuchar. He bends over backwards to please every last bit of skirt, yet here he's so bloody harsh on us!"
1549,"Iuchar: Is that a morsel of gossip I hear, soldier?"
1550,"Axe Knight: N-no, sir! Nothing to report here, sir!"
1551,"Iucharba: Larcei! Heh... I guess you finally realized you want to see me, am I right?"
1552,"Larcei: Look, Iucharba, I know you try to act like you're cool, tough and uncaring, but I know you're not all that bad. I mean, you've made a point of keeping your hands off the innocent all along. I guess I'd rather avoid fighting you, if I can..."
1553,"Iucharba: Yeah, I guess... Pushing people around never really sat right with me, y'know? Not like my brothers. And I'm getting real sick of the Loptr Church running the show here. All round Isaach they've been stealing kids and, so I hear, killing 'em all as sacrifices! Dad doesn't even so much as ask 'em nicely to stop! I've had it with 'em! Larcei, my men and I want to join your army. Just say the word and we're yours, yeah?"
1554,"Larcei: Wha- ...Are you serious? Iucharba, this is... Thanks so much! Er, I guess I was wrong to doubt you for all these years. Sorry."
1555,"Iucharba: Look, I'm no saint. Way I see it, at least now I can atone for everything I've done. Listen up, men! We're with the liberation army now! We're fightin' in the name of love and justice!"
1556,"Iuchar: What manner of nonsense is this? ...Alas, for Iucharba has turned his cloak for the rebels! Oh, how his claim to Larcei pierces my heart! Men, turn your blades on love's foul traitor!"
1557,"Iuchar: Oh, Larcei... How the twin hands of love and fate guide us! I've yearned for this day for many, many years, my beloved!"
1558,"Larcei: Iuchar?! Oh, for the love of... There's a stomach flu playing with your head, isn't there?"
1559,"Iuchar: Larcei... Oh, Larcei! Your words are as the sweetest birdsong! Your eyes are as the most brilliant stars! Oh, without you at my side, what purpose is there in life? What joy could possibly be?"
1560,Larcei: Stop it! How revolting! This is a battlefield! Are you out of your right mind?!
1561,"Iuchar: I can deny my heart no longer, Larcei. Believe me when I say I've tried! Alas, love is a maddening beast at times... What else can I do but be at your side? Men, we are joining the liberation army! From this day on, we are men of honor! Fight on, in the name of justice, love, and Larcei!"
1562,"Iucharba: You've gotta be kidding! Iuchar beat me to Larcei?! Bet he's gone and sided with her army, too, the weak-willed fool... Hmph... fine by me! Men, attack! Iuchar's unit is now the enemy!"
1563,"Danann: What in the blazes was that?! Just when I thought my son can't get any more useless, he goes and forgets how to fight! Schmidt! Get out there! Take back my castles, now!"
1564,"Schmidt: Yes, sir! You can depend on me."
1565,"Old man: Oh, thank you, Lord Seliph! You've restored peace and freedom to the kingdom of Isaach!"
1566,"Old man: Oh, gods bless you, Lord Seliph! Sophara is free once more, thanks to you."
1567,"Seliph: Is everyone unharmed, sir?"
1568,"Old man: Indeed, and overjoyed to see you to boot!"
1569,"Seliph: Thank you. I swear to you, before this day is done, King Danann will be no more and Isaach shall belong to its rightful people!"
1570,"Old man: Freedom... Oh, the word is tonic to my ears! Please, take care of yourself out there. Lord Seliph, you are the last and greatest hope for the future of this world and all its people. Only you, Lord Seliph, possess the power to free this world from the grip of darkness..."
1571,"Old man: Ohh! Lord Seliph, sir! Glad to see you're okay!"
1572,"Seliph: Is everyone unharmed, sir?"
1573,"Old man: Indeed, and ecstatic to see you to boot! Thanks to you, Lord Seliph, we know that at long last, Isaach shall have its freedom!"
1574,"Seliph: Thank you, sir, but the effort isn't mine alone. I could never have come so far without the support of the common man. You've all supported me from the beginning. I likely wouldn't be here if not for you!"
1575,"Old man: Fate is a funny thing, isn't it, sir? Just twenty years ago, our late king had the utmost trust in your grandfather's wisdom. Then your father came to protect Prince Shannan, and now the prince has guided you to adulthood. Perhaps fate has bound Isaach and Chalphy as one..."
1576,"Seliph: Mm. Isaach is the only home I've ever known, and Prince Shannan is like a brother to me. I pray our friendship lasts the rest of our lives."
1577,"Old man: Lord Seliph, you are the rightful heir to House Belhalla and the throne of Grannvale. Not a soul alive in Isaach, nor in the rest of the world, can doubt this. We beg of you! Raise the banner of justice high, march on Belhalla and reclaim your true throne!"
1578,"Karen: Wow! Deimne, it is you!"
1579,"Deimne: Huh? Karen! Hey, how’re you doing!"
1580,"Karen: Talk about long time no see! How many years ago was it that you and Mana left here… Hey, I’m just glad to see you again. You look great!"
1581,Deimne: Thanks. Sir Seliph set out to liberate the world from the empire’s tyranny and I’ve joined up with him. I can’t say I’ve been of much help yet.
1582,"Karen: Hmhm! That’s neat, Deimne. That’s a big change from the crybaby I once knew."
1583,"Deimne: Hahaha… Don’t you tell anyone that… I do still have a ways to go, though. I want you and the rest of the world to be able to live again in peace."
1584,"Karen: Wow. That’d be great, Deimne…"
1585,Deimne: What’s wrong? Did I say something?
1586,"Karen: No, it’s nothing. Here, I want you to have this necklace. I think you’ll find it useful."
1587,Deimne: Where did you get it?
1588,Karen: It’s a keepsake of my mothers. Wear it and you’ll get a little boost of power.
1589,Deimne: I can’t take this from you!
1590,"Karen: No, my mother wants you to have it. She said the time has come to utilize its power. Please, take it."
1591,Deimne: Thank you. I’ll be sure to bring it back when this war is over.
1592,"Karen: I’m sure you will, Deimne."
1593,"Deimne: Well, I better get going. Everyone’s waiting for me."
1594,"Karen: You take care now, Deimne!"
1595,(Deimne leaves)
1596,Karen: Deimne…
1597,Seliph: Julia!? Oh my god! You’re alright!
1598,"Julia: Yes, I’m fine. They locked me up in this castle, but I knew you’d come for me."
1599,"Lewyn: A job well done, Seliph! Thanks to you, Isaach is free from the Empire's grip."
1600,Seliph: Lewyn? Are you already finished in Leonster?
1601,"Lewyn: Yeah... I only just got back now. Look, Seliph. Are you aware that right now, this world's at a critical turning point?"
1602,Seliph: Hm? No... I'm afraid not.
1603,"Lewyn: It's been fifteen years since Arvis conquered all of Jugdral and united it as the Grannvale Empire. Honestly, for a while at first it wasn't all that bad. In the empire's dawn, Emperor Arvis sought to bind his nation using only the strictures of law. Sure, it was strict and constraining, but we still got a good few years of peace out of it. But obviously he changed his mind. A few years back, as if by magic, the Empire turned into that oppressive force we all know and love today. Even worse... the ancient heretics of the Loptyrian Order have arisen from the shadows once more and raised influence across the land. Their murderous rituals have returned with them, and all across Jugdral they abduct children to sacrifice in droves to resurrect their fell god. All attempts to resist the Empire are crushed and met with brutal executions or enslavement. It couldn't be plainer that they seek to return Jugdral to the days of brutal control by that ancient abomination, the Loptr Empire."
1604,"Seliph: This cannot be happening! I've heard all the rumors saying the same, but... Never did I think they could be more than rumors..."
1605,"Lewyn: By the look of it, Isaach hasn't had it quite as bad as most. Danann's two sons, at least, refused to follow through on the child hunts."
1606,Seliph: ...
1607,"Lewyn: Of course, there's always been people trying to rebel against the Empire left, right and center, but they were all scattered and disorganized. Before you, none have ever posed a proper threat to the Empire. They were all swiftly crushed before they could so much as blink. Jugdral desperately needs a savior. It needs a man to unite behind in the name of liberty. And I'm pretty sure that man is you, Seliph. You're the only one who stands a chance."
1608,Seliph: Hold on a moment! Are you sure of this? A savior would require power I sorely lack...
1609,"Lewyn: Chalk it up to duty, Seliph. You're the eldest child of Empress Deirdre... That makes you the elder brother to the crown prince Julius. You're the one true heir to Saint Heim. Your destiny is to unite the power of the Crusaders of this era and free the world from this evil grip."
1610,Seliph: But...
1611,"Lewyn: Trust me, you really do have what it takes. Your true power and potential sleeps within you: that is, the sacred blood of the Crusader Baldr. Once you get your holy blade, Tyrfing, not even the heavens will be able to stand in your way!"
1612,Seliph: But I-
1613,"Lewyn: Sorry, Seliph, but that's how the gods will it. You're Sigurd's son: The son of a man who fate led to a brutal end. The fulfillment of his dying wishes and his final quest falls to you. You can't afford to go doubting yourself now. You understand, Seliph?"
1614,"Seliph: Y-yes... Yes, I do. If this is fate and the will of the gods, then so be it. I will do my duty."
1615,"Lewyn: There actually isn't a single absolute fate, nor is there just one person it all hinges upon. As obtuse as that sounds, trust me, one day it'll make sense. Sigurd left behind so much to help you on your quest. Most importantly, the many friendships he forged in his life... Me, for instance. Brave youths from all over are already lining up to join your cause, all guided by Sigurd's kindness."
1616,"Seliph: Mm. My father won the love and trust of so many people, from all walks of life. I can only pray that in time I'll prove my worthiness to his legacy."
1617,"Lewyn: You'll be fine. Anyway, to business. Our immediate goal now is to reach Leonster. The son of Quan, your father's closest friend, raised his own rebellion only to suffer severe losses. He's in pretty urgent need of backup. I know you've had no time to rest, but we need to get going as soon as possible. For now, at least, we can leave Isaach in the care of its citizens. Odds are we'll run into Prince Shannan on our way."
1618,Seliph: Understood!
1619,"Old man: King Danann has 3 sons. Brian, his oldest, is in Grannvale. The other two are here in Isaach. Iuchar is the lord at Isaach Castle, and Iucharba is the lord at Sophara. They both have a thing for Larcei of your army. Always quarreling those two… But they’re both basically good boys. I bet they’d even join up with you all."
1620,"Man: Every last citizen of Isaach believes in and trusts Lord Seliph! We owe his family dearly for how his father, long ago, rescued and helped raise our Prince Shannan!"
1621,"Young man: Prince Shannan is our beacon of hope for Isaach's future. Once he returns with his divine blade, Balmung, in hand... Well, those imperial sods won't stand a chance at all! Every last one of them will be run right out of our great land!"
1622,"Young woman: Y'know the liberation army's leader, Seliph? They say he's the rightful heir to Grannvale. I bet we'd all have a much better time with him on the throne if that were true, huh! Here, take this here skill ring. Go on, do your best! We're all behind you!"
1623,"Young woman: I've been hearing a lot about how the Empire's been hunting kids in all those other countries... Thanks to you lot, Isaach's free from the Empire at last, but the rest of the world's still in a really dark place... All across Jugdral, they're all waiting for Lord Seliph to rise up and defeat the Empire! Please, I'm begging you... You've gotta make it to Grannvale soon!"
1624,"Young man: Ooh, aren't ya from that liberator's army? Glad ta’ see yer makin' a stand now! This is great news! With y'all around, we've finally got a shot at makin' them imperial cowards run outta here with their tails between their legs!"
1625,"Old man: Ohhh! If it isn't Lord Seliph himself! We can't thank you enough for all your help! Here, allow me to give you my granddaughter's hand in marriage. We raised her as well as well can be, and she's the kindest, sweetest little thing! Oh, I remember that even as a kid she-"
1626,"Young woman: Grandpa, knock it off! Ugh, this is so embarrassing! ...I'm sorry, Lord Seliph. I wouldn't wish seeing that sorry display upon anyone! But, er... if you do like me, milord..."
1627,Seliph: Er... Wait a moment... That isn't why I'm here...
1628,"Young woman: Ahahahaha! C'mon, Lord Seliph! It's just a joke! A j-o-k-e! Look, you've gone bright red! How adorable!"
1629,Seliph: Er...
1630,"Old man: I'm completely serious, though."
1631,"Seliph: Oh. Oh, dear..."
1632,"Creidne: Hey! Quit hanging around, it’s depressing!"
1633,Iucharba: Uh… I’m just trying my best to protect you…
1634,Creidne: …
1635,"Creidne: Hey! Quit hanging around, it’s depressing!"
1636,Iuchar: Don’t say such heartless things! This is an expression of my love! I’ll always watch over you! Please don’t forget that!
1637,Creidne: …
1638,"Scáthach: You holding up okay so far, Larcei?"
1639,"Larcei: Yeah, I'm getting by fine..."
1640,"Scáthach: Just be careful out here, okay? Your usual brazen antics'll only get you in trouble now."
1641,"Larcei: I know, I know, I know! What, do you think I'm still a child?"
1642,"Scáthach: Heh... Man, that iron will of yours! Guess you're just like Mom was, if what Prince Shannan's told us is true."
1643,Larcei: Yeah... Ayra... I can't remember a thing about her. You?
1644,"Scáthach: No, of course not. We're twins, remember? If you were too young to remember, then so was I! We weren't even two years old yet back then... It was Oifey who took us with him when he fled to Isaach with Seliph. We waited and waited, but Mom never followed... I guess she didn't make it out of the Battle of Belhalla alive..."
1645,Larcei: Scáthach! You swore you'd never say awful things like that! Mom is alive! ALIVE! I'm sure of it! Don't you dare say otherwise ever again!
1646,"Scáthach: ...Er, sorry, Larcei... You're right... I'm sorry."
1647,"Dalvin: Creidne, are you alright?"
1648,"Creidne: Yeah, I’m managing."
1649,"Dalvin: Well, take it easy, alright? We don’t need you pulling any of your stunts out here."
1650,Creidne: I’m not a child! You don’t have to speak to me like that.
1651,"Dalvin: Sorry. Hey, you know Iuchar and Iucharba, right? Man, I can’t figure them out."
1652,"Creidne: They’re driving me nuts. Geez, I can’t stand men. They make me want to puke!"
1653,Dalvin: You just hate men because of the imperial troops. Not all men are like that.
1654,"Creidne: Yeah, I know. But I still get freaked out when I’m around a guy."
1655,Dalvin: Any guy?
1656,"Creidne: Well, I can handle being around you and Lord Seliph."
1657,Dalvin: Hmph… So how about Shannan?
1658,Creidne: Dalvin!!
1659,"Lester: Lana?! Don't tell me you're fighting, too!"
1660,"Lana: I am, Lester. I simply couldn't bear to leave Lord Seliph to fight alone..."
1661,"Lester: Why am I not surprised... Look, I know I can't get you to leave, but just be careful, okay? It'd break mother's heart if something happened to you out here."
1662,"Lana: I know, but actually, there was something mother told me... She told me that we owe the greatest of debts to the people of Isaach, and that if we can help them in any way, we owe it to them to do all we can."
1663,"Lester: Yeah, I guess she's right. I mean, we wouldn't even be here now if not for the help of the locals... ...So, er, where is mother, anyway?"
1664,"Lana: She's back in Tirnanog's abbey, working like always."
1665,"Lester: Right... Listen, Lana. We've got to give this battle our all, both in mother's name and in the name of our lost father... Someday, I know, we'll finally be able to help mother return to her home, Yugvi..."
1666,"Lana: You're right, Lester."
1667,Deimne: Muirne? You’re fighting too!?
1668,"Muirne: Yeah, I was so worried about Lord Seliph."
1669,Deimne: Hmm… I thought so.
1670,Muirne: Thought what?
1671,"Deimne: Ah, nothin’. Just don’t get your hopes up. He’s of royal blood, you know. He’s actually a member of the Grannvale Royal Family. In all reality, we shouldn’t even be near him. Just don’t get yourself hurt. Okay, Muirne?"
1672,"Muirne: Deimne, you have it all wrong! I’m merely trying to keep him out of danger!"
1673,Deimne: Really? Er… Sorry. I’m just trying to watch out for you.
1674,"Muirne: I know, Deimne, and I appreciate it."
1675,"Oifey: Oh, thank the gods, sire! You're safe!"
1676,Seliph: Oifey! Glad to see you made it back. What news of the rest of the world?
1677,"Oifey: The Empire's grip is tightening still further, as if trying to choke life from the people. It's inciting doomed revolts all across Jugdral."
1678,"Seliph: So it's as I thought... It isn't as if the Empire's tyranny would ever be limited to only Isaach... Oifey, is it feasible to assist them?"
1679,"Oifey: Not as we presently stand, sire. We still lack the strength to properly challenge the Empire."
1680,Seliph: Then what of our present battle? The war for Isaach's freedom has already begun. Turning back now would be impossible...
1681,"Oifey: Mm. There's certainly no chance of returning you to hiding, sire, now that your whereabouts have been leaked. Starting the fight now was reckless, but we've no choice but to continue..."
1682,"Seliph: Oifey, I'm sorry I let all of this happen behind your back, but we had no choice. Even so, I don't think I could have stood letting Isaach suffer under Danann's thumb any longer. I trust you understand Oifey..."
1683,"Oifey: I do, sire. Now, our priority is to lay siege to Danann's capital, Rivough, with all due haste. Danann must fall before the Empire can send him reinforcements. We cannot afford to wait!"
1684,"Lana: Julia, right? Hello there! Are you doing okay without Lewyn?"
1685,"Julia: You're Lana... Yes, thank you. I'm fine..."
1686,"Lana: You know, Lord Seliph's actually really been worrying about you. If there's anything I can do to help you, just let me know and I'll get right on it."
1687,Julia: Mm. Thank you...
1688,"Lana: Oh, and I've got a little something for you."
1689,Julia: This is... A Mend staff?
1690,"Lana: You can use these, right?"
1691,"Julia: For me? Thank you, Lana. With this... I know I can help everyone."
1692,"Lana: You're welcome, Julia. Let's give this war our all, together!"
1693,"Fee: Hey there! You're Lord Seliph, right?"
1694,"Seliph: Indeed I am. And you, miss?"
1695,Fee: Call me Fee! I'm from Silesse.
1696,"Seliph: Silesse, you say? Are you a pegasus knight, then?"
1697,"Fee: Er, not just yet. I'm kinda still in training. My mom was one, though! Actually, in that big war years ago, she helped Lord Sigurd out in his army."
1698,"Seliph: Is that so? She has my utmost gratitude, on my father's behalf. Now, what brings you here, Fee?"
1699,"Fee: See, what happened was I was looking for my brother, who ran away ages ago. But then I heard about you, sir, and how you're taking on the Empire yourself! And I just knew I had to be here too. Can I join your army, sir? Please?"
1700,"Seliph: Certainly! Thank you. What of your brother, though?"
1701,"Fee: It's silly, sir, but I have this feeling that we're gonna run into him somewhere down the line..."
1702,Hermina: You’re Lord Seliph?
1703,Seliph: Yes. And who are you?
1704,Hermina: I am Hermina. I just got here from Silesse.
1705,Seliph: Silesse? Are you a Pegasus Knight?
1706,"Hermina: Yes. Er… Actually, I’m still in training."
1707,Seliph: I see. So what are you doing in Isaach?
1708,"Hermina: Well, I initially set out to find my brother. But when I heard word of you taking on the empire, I made a little change in plans. Please, I’d like to join your liberation army."
1709,"Seliph: Yeah, that’s fine with me. But what about your brother?"
1710,"Hermina: If I join your army… well, I have a gut feeling that I’ll run across him eventually."
1711,"Arthur: Lord Seliph, right? Nice to meet you."
1712,Seliph: Who are you?
1713,Arthur: The name's Arthur. I came here from Silesse.
1714,"Seliph: Wait, so you are that Arthur fellow? I've heard of how you have been aiding us so far. Thank you so much!"
1715,"Arthur: Eh, it was no big deal."
1716,"Seliph: You are capable of wielding magic, yes? That's truly impressive. I'm almost envious!"
1717,Arthur: My mother was a talented war-mage... But I've still got a lot to learn myself.
1718,"Seliph: We all do, do we not? So long as we all fight together, though, perhaps we still truly can change our world. After all, that's what brought us here today."
1719,"Arthur: Yeah, you're right... My power's at your disposal, sir. I'll give my all to aid the cause. I'm glad we could finally meet, Lord Seliph."
1720,"Seliph: Are you faring alright so far, Julia?"
1721,"Julia: Mm. Thank you, Lord Seliph..."
1722,"Seliph: Actually, I have something for you. I found this in Sophara."
1723,Julia: What is...?
1724,"Seliph: It's a light tome called Aura. You can wield this, yes?"
1725,Julia: Aura... This... Why does this sound familiar...
1726,Seliph: Excellent! Hopefully you'll now have an easier time protecting yourself in combat.
1727,"Julia: Thank you, Lord Seliph. Thank you so much..."
1728,"Seliph: Are you faring alright so far, Julia?"
1729,"Julia: Mm. Thank you, Lord Seliph..."
1730,"Seliph: Actually, I have something for you. I found this in Isaach Castle."
1731,Julia: What is...?
1732,"Seliph: It's a light tome called Nosferatu. You can wield this, yes?"
1733,"Julia: Yes, I believe so..."
1734,Seliph: Excellent! Hopefully you'll now have an easier time protecting yourself in combat.
1735,"Julia: Thank you, Lord Seliph. Thank you so much..."
1736,"Seliph: Lana, I still can't say I feel comfortable having you out here in the field. It's much too dangerous."
1737,"Lana: Y-yes, milord, but I'm sure I'll be fine."
1738,"Seliph: Please, take the utmost care! If you stray from behind the front lines, you'll be too vulnerable a target."
1739,Lana: But-
1740,"Seliph: Lana, please... I'm worried for your sake."
1741,"Lana: ...Okay, milord."

1746,"Word of the first victory of Prince Seliph and his liberation army quickly spreads far and wide, inspiring courage anew in the Empire's victims. Still more uprisings erupt across Jugdral, but once again, precious few are properly organized and are easily crushed, and the death toll climbs ever higher... Leonster, a kingdom in the Thracian Peninsula... Prince Leif, the son of Quan, had raised an army with the aid of the knight Finn, but they have suffered a devastating loss before King Bloom's vast hordes and are stranded in hostile ground. Before Seliph lies the Aed Desert, ruled by the Loptrian Kutuzov from the Aed Shrine; the oasis city of Darna, governed by the ex-merchant Bramsel and the captain of his sellsword army, Javarro; and Melgen Castle, guarded by Prince Ishtore and the renowned General Liza. King Bloom himself, the son of the late Duke Reptor, awaits at the capital city of Ulster with his niece, the mage Tine. In Rivough, Seliph and the warriors of his liberation army now prepare themselves to embark on a journey and come to the aid of their allies in far-away Leonster. Each warrior sets aside their worries as, under Seliph's leadership, they prepare for the new battle on their horizon.
"
1747,"Leif: Finn, what's the situation? Any word from the other division yet?"
1748,"Finn: ...We've failed, milord. Every last soldier in the Ulster raid is dead. This is a crippling blow to our army. We've lost most of our might in one fell swoop."
1749,Leif: This can't be happening... I thought this was our big chance... Was all of this useless all along? Damn it all! I'll strangle Bloom himself with my bare hands!
1750,"Finn: Please calm yourself, milord! This isn't the end quite yet. I've just had a word with King Lewyn. He's sending Prince Seliph's liberation army to back us up. Until then, no matter what, milord, we must endure the siege."
1751,"Leif: Prince Seliph, you say... He's the son of my father's old friend Sigurd, and of Empress Deirdre, right? I pray we can meet him soon... Perhaps if we merge our efforts with his, we'll have a better chance of protecting people from the Empire."
1752,"Nanna: That's right, Leif! Besides, if we just let ourselves lose now, wouldn't your men's death's all be in vain? I think we should abandon the castle for now, and seek refuge near that western church."
1753,"Leif: Mm, you're right... I suppose we don't have much of a choice now. Very well. Our priority now is to play this out defensively for the time being. Until Prince Seliph gets here, we must endure..."
1754,Bloom: What's your problem now?! Can't you capture even as worthless a castle as this? Are you worms taking this seriously?
1755,"General: Y-yes, milord... The thing is, though, the enemy is proving to be of a resilient sort. We're struggling to breach their defenses."
1756,"Bloom: Buffoons, all of you! Do you really think I want to hear excuses? I want Leonster seized! No more delays! If you waste any more time on this, then we'll have to contend with those Isaachian mongrels as well!"
1757,"General: Y-yes, milord! We will strike immediately, milord!"
1758,"Patty: Hooboy, those rumors weren't kidding! That place was full to the brim with treasure. Been a long time since I've had a haul like this! But I can't afford to dawdle now. Still gotta get out of here, and quick..."
1759,"Shannan: Hey, excuse me! Hand that sword over. You can keep everything else, but I need the sword."
1760,"Patty: Where do you think you get off, trying to take somebody else's hard-earned goods? Do you have any idea how tough it was to get my hands on this sword? If you want it, come and get it, nincompoop!"
1761,Shannan: W-wait!
1762,Kutuzov: What? Thieves have plundered our treasury? And they absconded with Balmung?! You fools! Go seize them! Now!
1763,"Dark mage: Y-yes, Your Grace... But, er, Your Grace... Surely a master of dark magics of your caliber could crush common thieves such as these with a single blow, even from here?"
1764,"Kutuzov: I've misplaced my Book of Fenrir... My men are scouring the shrine to find it, but so far it has yet to emerge..."
1765,"Dark mage: Understood, Your Grace. In that case, my clan and I will take a few mercenaries and pursue them. We swear to you, Your Grace, that we will have the treasure back where it belongs post-haste!"
1766,"Seliph: So the route to Leonster requires that we cross this vast desert, yes?"
1767,"Lewyn: Yeah... The Aed Shrine's the real problem here, as it's controlled by the Loptyrian Cult. The Order's fell mages infest the desert, mercilessly assaulting anyone they find in it. People've taken to calling the region the Desert of Death... A fitting name, really."
1768,Seliph: I can only imagine how awfully travelers struggle here! I wonder... Perhaps it'd be possible to seize the Shrine from the Order.
1769,"Lewyn: Heh, I thought you'd never ask. There's always a way, but this one won't be easy. We may need to make sacrifices."
1770,"Seliph: So be it. At this point we've little choice. Not to mention, Shannan is likely still in the desert... For now, let's focus on taking control of Aed. All else will begin there!"
1771,"Soldier: Milord, we've received word that the Isaachian rebels are on the move."
1772,"Bramsel: Isaachian rebels? Ah, the ones led by that brat... Celice, was it? Or Serlis? Something like that. Heh... Interesting. Very interesting, indeed! The Empire's put a hefty price on that boy's head. Let's make sure we're the ones to rake in that bounty, shall we? Keep our border locked down for the time being. The best option is to let them run themselves ragged, leaving them wide open to our strike! Instruct Commander Javarro to put his squad on standby. His services will be needed in short order!"
1773,"Lene: Hey, what's with all this noise? You're not about to go to war, are you?"
1774,"Ares: No, we've not entered such a dire state yet. For the time being, we are merely preparing for the arrival of the Isaachian rebel army."
1775,"Lene: Oh, that's good. I guess I'm a bit worried about how you're gonna have to go and fight, too, Ares..."
1776,"Ares: What sorry excuse for a mercenary would I be if I refused to join a battle, Lene? Never mind one which, rumor has it, will oppose Sigurd's son... Never would I deny a chance to personally slay the spawn of my father's mortal foe..."
1777,"Lene: Hee hee! You're still going on about that, are you? Oh, you dolt. I mean, think about it. Both your father and that Sigurd man were knights, weren't they? And isn't killing part of a knight's job? It's like my job. Sometimes, I've got to dance for foul, leering men! I hate it, but it's part of the work. I have to just deal with it. We've all gotta do what we gotta do to get by in life. I dunno... I just don't think it's right to hate someone for doing their job."
1778,"Ares: Lene... I understand. I'll have to think it over for a time, but I do understand..."
1779,Myrmidon: Lord Bramsel has decreed that none shall pass this point for the time being. Move along.
1780,"Dark mage: Good news, Your Grace. We've found your Book of Fenrir."
1781,"Kutuzov: Hmm? Excellent! Heh heh... This will be the end of the road for the rebels! With their dying thoughts, they shall marvel in fear at the terrifying power of Fenrir..."
1782,Seliph: So this is the Aed Shrine... It looks so sparse...
1783,"Lewyn: The remnants of the Loptrian Empire have hidden within the depths of the shrine for generations. They had no choice. Trying to build new lives on the surface would have led to their mass persecution, or even being burned at the stake. I suspect that at first they weren't really bad or unusual people, but before long, their life here twisted them into what we know them as today."
1784,"Seliph: I can hardly believe it... It's as if they were all being tortured for the sins of their long-dead Imperial ancestors... All my life, these people have been branded as the ""dark cult"", or the ""devil's kin""... I can barely imagine their pain... Hold a moment. This scribble on the wall... Is that a child's penmanship? It's a prayer... And it begs for the return of the dark god... ...Was Loptous the only hope these people had?"
1785,"Lewyn: Yeah... Consider this a lesson, Seliph. Good and evil can't be easily reduced to such simple, black-and-white ideals. If you must hate, hate the evil which lurks in us all, not the individual. Never forget this."
1786,"Bramsel: Aed's fallen, has it? Heh... Perfect. Open our borders! We'll let them proceed through toward Melgen Castle, let them wear themselves out some more, then strike their wide-open backs! Kehehe... It's almost too easy to be any fun! Wouldn't you say, Javarro?"
1787,"Javarro: Heh, just another hard day's work for you, sir... But hey, so long as you're payin' the bills, my men've got nothin' to complain 'bout. 'Bout time we had a good fight, anyhow."
1788,"Ishtore: Hmm... The rebels have already taken Aed? Liza, what do you make of the situation?"
1789,"Liza: I suspect their most likely aim is to come to the aid of the Leonster rebels. As it stands, Ishtore, your father is still preoccupied besieging them at Leonster. Should they reach Ulster and strike while he's occupied, the results would be disastrous... It is imperative that we intercept them here and now. Our force will be more than enough."
1790,"Ishtore: Indeed... My lord father could use the aid. Liza, may I place you in command of my army?"
1791,"Liza: Certainly. Leave everything to me, milord."
1792,"Ishtore: I confess I'd rather keep you away from the eye of the storm, but there's nobody whom I could ever trust more than you. My apologies, Liza."
1793,"Liza: I... Rest assured, milord. You've nothing to worry about. Just... Please, Ishtore, be careful... Now, excuse me... Men, move out! Assume your positions!"
1794,"Bramsel: Ohohohoho! Lene, was it? That was quite the dance there! Come hither. I have a little reward for you..."
1795,"Lene: Eww, how rude! You get off your butt and come over here if you've got something to give me!"
1796,"Bramsel: Hohoho! As cute as that fiery heart is, mouthing off to me so violently? I can't say I care so much for that. Bring her to me!"
1797,Lene: W-what d'you think you're doing?! Let go! Let! Me! Go! You ANIMALS!
1798,"Ares: Hold! Take your hands off the girl, craven scum!"
1799,"Bramsel: What? And who exactly are you? How dare you, a common sellsword, turn your blade on your employer!"
1800,"Ares: Nobody shall lay a hand on her, lest you face severe consequence. Are we clear?"
1801,Bramsel: Gah... What is this sorry little pantomime?! Seize him! End his little life!
1802,"Ares: You all see my sword, correct? I trust I need not introduce the demon blade. Beware, for Mystletainn craves the blood of men! Who dares to come forth and slake its thirst?"
1803,Bramsel: M-Mystletainn?! That's the one and only demon blade? Th-then you... It can't be...
1804,"Ares: Oh, but it can. It is indeed I: Ares, the Black Knight."
1805,"Bramsel: M-my deepest apologies, sir! I was merely jesting about! Look, I'll never lay hands on the little darling ever again! You forgive me, right? Right?"
1806,"Ares: ...Very well. Lene, are you unharmed?"
1807,"Lene: Yeah... Thank you, Ares..."
1808,Bramsel: Gah... Damn them both! I'll make them suffer... You'll see...
1809,"Lewyn: At last, Seliph, you've reached Melgen. Leonster's just a stone's throw from here."
1810,"Seliph: Say, Lewyn... Will this war ever end? I still doubt that Prince Ishtore or his general were truly wicked people... Must we kill still more like them?"
1811,"Lewyn: That may be so, but don't forget they still actively served the will of a brutal tyrant. As far as our cause is concerned, there is no doubt. They were the enemy. This is a war, Seliph. There's more to it than only ever fighting the thoroughly evil, or those whom we hate."
1812,Seliph: I suppose so...
1813,"Lewyn: Heh! It's okay, Seliph. You're a good man, through and through. You could just stand to worry a bit less. Now, then! We've got our goal to focus on: coming to the rescue over in Leonster."
1814,Seliph: Indeed. Let's move in on Leonster. Everything shall begin there!
1815,"Bramsel: What? Melgen's fallen already?! Blast! We were too slow! Oh, well. We can still ambush them while they regroup. Men, this is our chance! Javarro, send in your brigade! Hit them hard while their backs are turned! Leave no survivors!"
1816,"Javarro: At once, sir!"
1817,"Lene: D'you really have to go, Ares? Please don't leave... Please!"
1818,"Ares: I've little choice in the matter. It was Javarro who found me as a lost infant, and raised me all these years. I owe him dearly..."
1819,Lene: Don't you get it? He's just using your loyalty to treat you like a weapon! I... I hate him so much!
1820,Ares: Lene... No that isn't...
1821,"Lene: Okay, fine! Whatever! Go with him, if you love him so much! It's your life to waste, after all! But you can just go forget we ever met!"
1822,Ares: Lene...
1823,"Bramsel: Hmph... That Ares buffoon has gone, has he? Good riddance..."
1824,Bloom: Vampa! Fetra! Eliu! Deploy at once! I want you to show these rebel pigs just what it is that the Empire can do!
1825,"Vampa: Yes, milord. Leave it to us."
1826,"Fetra: We will never let you down, milord."
1827,"Eliu: The rebels shall be destroyed quickly, cleanly, efficiently and utterly. Excuse us, milord."
1828,"Bloom: Hmm! Everything depends on you. Tine. You, too, will deploy at once."
1829,"Tine: ...Y-yes, uncle. As you wish..."
1830,Bloom: Hmph... One would think I could expect more gratitude from someone I raised out of the goodness of my heart after their mother died. Or have you forgotten my many kindnesses?
1831,"Tine: No, uncle..."
1832,"Bloom: Good. Now, get moving. Remember, these rebels are responsible for murdering my dear son, Ishtore, and his true love, Liza! Avenging them is your mission, Tine!"
1833,"Bloom: The rest of you, move out at once! I don't want a single rebel left breathing!"
1834,"Vampa: Fetra. Eliu. I trust you already understand. We must work in absolute, perfect unison. We will be the ones to claim Seliph's head as a trophy this day. We mustn't be beaten by Tine's unit."
1835,Tine: I don't understand... All the villagers talk of the rebels as if they're liberating heroes... But why... Why did they kill Ishtore? I... I don't know what to do anymore... Oh... Mother... What would you do...
1836,"Bramsel: There you are, girlie! How dare you embarrass me like that the other day. It's about time I thanked you properly!"
1837,"Lene: Oh? And what exactly're you gonna do about it? I see right through you! the moment Ares is nowhere in sight, you think it's okay to act all tough again, you vile louse! Don't even think about coming any closer. I don't need Ares around to stop you!"
1838,Bramsel: Of all the nerve... You little wench! Throw her in the dungeon! You'll have plenty of time to think about what you've done there!
1839,Lene: Ahh! No... Ares...
1840,"Javarro: Y'know, I don't get you Ares. Why the hell'd you go and get yourself all cosied up with a broad like that? Oh well, I guess. It's all in the past. You're gonna forget 'er sooner or later."
1841,"Ares: I beg your pardon? What exactly are you trying to say, Javarro?"
1842,"Javarro: Heh heh... Oh, nothing. Well, 'cept that I bet Bramsel's right about to..."
1843,"Ares: T-this can't be... Javarro! How could you know his foul intent, yet let your tongue lie still before me?!"
1844,"Javarro: You can't worry 'bout the fairer sex, Ares. Have your fun with 'em, but never stick around for when their sorry lives come crashin' down..."
1845,Ares: How dare you! And to think you held my trust for so long... I must return to Darna! Lene needs me!
1846,"Javarro: Nah, that ain't gonna happen, see. Nobody, and I mean nobody, blows off my orders and turns tail on my watch! Not even you, Ares."
1847,"Ares: Keh... I've come far in your company, Javarro, but our association ends now. If anyone wishes to stop me, Mystletainn will eagerly welcome your necks!"
1848,"Javarro: Grr... I'll show you your place, whelp!"
1849,"Arthur: Excuse me, but... That pendant of yours..."
1850,Tine: Huh? It's... It's a memento of my mother...
1851,"Arthur: Really?! Then you're Tine! Oh, I've finally found you!"
1852,Tine: Er... Who are you?
1853,"Arthur: Here, maybe this'll clear things up. This pendant of mine's exactly the same as yours, and I've had it my whole life."
1854,"Tine: Y-you're right, but... What are you saying?"
1855,"Arthur: See, decades ago, my mother was a warrior fighting in Sigurd's liberation army, and after the war she fled to Silesse with her children. When I was little, my mother and my newborn sister disappeared... I was left behind with nothing but this pendant. I only recently learned what really happened. It was King Bloom of Ulster. He abducted them. He took my family from me. The rumors I've heard all said Mother had died a while ago, but they also said my sister is still alive... That's you, Tine! I've finally found you, after all these years! I came all this way just to see you again..."
1856,"Tine: I... I never even knew Bloom did that to Mother... It makes sense, though... I can't remember much of Mother, but I know I never saw her smile or laugh... You're my brother... Oh... Sniff..."
1857,"Arthur: I don't suppose you'd like to lay down your arms and join our army, Tine? We've still got so much to talk about."
1858,"Tine: Mm. Thank you, brother. I never did want to fight..."
1859,"Dalvin: Hey, Tristan. I got something to ask ya."
1860,Tristan: Oh… it’s you. What?
1861,"Dalvin: Hey, show a guy a little respect, would ya? Anyway, I was just thinking. Do you think we’re holding Sir Seliph back any?"
1862,Tristan: We? Don’t you mean YOU? I’m holding up my own out here.
1863,"Dalvin: Is that so? Alright, let me hear what you’ve done so far."
1864,"Tristan: Ah, well… You know, I’ve… um…"
1865,"Dalvin: See there? That’s just what I’m saying. You can’t think of anything, can ya?"
1866,"Tristan: Alright, alright! So what’s your point?"
1867,"Dalvin: Let’s get a little dueling practice in. I want to move up to the front line! I doubt I’d learn a whole lot from you, but I’ll do anything to avoid getting castle duty!"
1868,Tristan: You know you’ve got a real crappy way of asking someone a favor? Just forget it.
1869,"Dalvin: Oh, c’mon! Look… Would you pretty please be my sparring partner with sugar on top? How about that!?"
1870,"Tristan: Where the hell do you get off!? Okay, I’ll fight you… only to shut you up! You ready?"
1871,Dalvin: …Heyah!
1872,Tristan: …Yaaa!
1873,Seliph: So this is Darna... The legendary city...
1874,"Lewyn: Long ago, at the peak of the old holy war, Darna was the last bastion of the resistance army... It was the last free land in Jugdral. In battle after battle, the overwhelming might of the Loptrian Empire had devastated the resistance. Ultimately, the last of the resistance soldiers barricaded themselves within Darna's walls. Battered and wounded as they were, they were nonetheless determined to fight to the bitter end. But then, suddenly, there was a miracle... From the heavens descended twelve gods, who bestowed upon twelve young heroes miraculous weapons and immense powers. Thus were born the Twelve Crusaders, the heroes who led the resistance to victory."
1875,"Seliph: That was the legendary Miracle of Darna, yes?"
1876,"Lewyn: Yeah, the very same. And even as we speak, Seliph, another miracle is dawning upon us. Just as the resurrection of Loptous looms on the horizon, so too are the Crusaders themselves arising in our world once more..."
1877,Seliph: ...I beg your pardon?
1878,"Lewyn: Heh... Don't worry, Seliph. You'll understand soon enough..."
1879,Ares: I pray that Lene is still unharmed. I must hasten back to Darna...
1880,Ares: Lene! Where are you? Answer me!
1881,Lene: Ares...
1882,"Ares: Oh! Is everything okay, Lene?"
1883,"Lene: N-no... It's not... But someone from the liberation army rescued me... And I... I knew you'd come, Ares..."
1884,"Ares: Lene, I... I beg your forgiveness... I was a fool! So very, very foolish... I should have heeded your word..."
1885,"Lene: It's okay... After all, you're here now..."
1886,"Ares: I swear to you, I'll never let this happen again..."
1887,"Lene: And I swear I'll try to keep my big mouth to myself from now on! Don't ever leave me again, Ares..."
1888,"Seliph: Right. Leonster is back under our control. That leaves only Ulster... Everyone, we've only a little further to go. We can do this!"
1889,Daisy: Guess who!
1890,Shannan: Ahh!
1891,"Daisy: Ha… HAHAHA! I scared ya, didn’t I!?"
1892,"Shannan: D, Daisy! I nearly took a swing at you! Quit playing around, alright!?"
1893,Daisy: But I’m bored. And I’m too weak to fight anybody.
1894,"Shannan: I’ll teach you how to use that sword then. I don’t have much time, so I’ll keep it real simple."
1895,Daisy: Wow! My own private lesson with Shannan! Wheee!
1896,"Shannan: You’d better take this seriously, or you can just forget it!"
1897,Daisy: Ulp… sorry.
1898,"Shannan: Okay. First, let’s begin with posture. You’ll want to… Hey! Are you listening to me!?"
1899,Daisy: Sigh… Hmm?
1900,"Lewyn: Excellent work, Seliph. Thanks to you, Ulster is finally free from the Empire."
1901,"Seliph: I wouldn't get too excited, Lewyn. King Bloom yet lives. I assume he fled to Conote amidst the flurry of Ulster's capture."
1902,"Lewyn: Eh, these sorts of things can't be helped. After all, the war's only just beginning. We're only now starting to carve our foothold in the Thracian Peninsula."
1903,"Seliph: And yet, the citizens are already all so eager to support us! I've seldom seen such joy..."
1904,"Lewyn: For the first time, they've got hope for a future free from the Empire's abuse. You're the people's last hope, Seliph, but the worst of the war still lies ahead, huh?"
1905,"Seliph: Mm. And yet, I've so much incredible talent fighting by my side! With such amazing men and women with me I know no challenge will be too great!"
1906,"Lewyn: Yeah... You'll all do just fine, Seliph."
1907,"Young woman: Darna is lorded over by Count Bramsel, who's as revolting as they come! If he isn't playing the slimy sycophant to some visiting Grannvale noble or other, he's prancin' around like he's the gods' gift to kings! Ugh... The sooner somebody sticks a sword through that pig of a man, the better!"
1908,"Old man: It ain't that simple, though. Standing between you lot and Bramsel is the best mercenary force his money can buy. One of 'em, Ares, is the strongest of 'em all. He's still just a kid, really, but he's frightfully strong, 'cause he's got this magic blade called Mystletainn. From what I heard, the mercenary captain, Javarro, found Ares as a wee little kid and took him in. The two're real close, I hear. You ain't got much of a chance against Ares. Sorry to rain on your parade like that, kid. Here, take this shield ring as an apology. You oughta be able to get some use out of this."
1909,"Old Woman: Ahh... The liberation army... It's a blessing to know that Prince Leif has finally taken a stand. Lord Quan... Lady Ethlyn... I pray you're both proud of your son... Please, kind knight, accept this speed ring. I'd like you to wear it proudly to your battles."
1910,"Woman: The Empire's brutal rule has broken us so... We can't live like this much longer. Please, I beg of you... Save us all..."
1911,"Young man: Near the end of the war all those years ago, this entire region was conquered by King Bloom, the son of Duke Reptor. His rule's been one tragedy after another... Just when we thought he couldn't get any worse, now he's just letting those child hunts happen! We can't take this anymore..."
1912,"Old man: King Bloom and his queen, Hilda, have got two children between 'em: Ishtar and Ishtore. Ishtar's ruling over Munster right now, and Ishtore's posted at Melgen Castle, both doing Bloom's dirty work. Unlike their folks, they're fine youths. You'll be sure to face 'em sooner or later... Be on your guard, stranger."
1913,"Man: Bloom's got some terrifying warriors on his side. There's Vampa, Fetra, and Eliu, a trio of powerful sorceress sisters. Then there's Tine, a young mage... Bloom's niece she may be, but that girl's still got a kind heart on her. She's come to our aid and the aid of our neighbor villages time and again... She's nothing like her family..."
1914,"Anna: My boyfriend left to join the war. I’d guess you’re fighting for someone you care for, too. I wish I was strong like you. All I can do is sit back and wait. Oh, here. I have something for you. This holy sword will increase your resistance. Get in a few swings for me, will you?"
1915,"Laylea: Thank you, I’ll do my best. By the way, what’s your name?"
1916,Anna: Me? I’m Anna and my boyfriend’s name is Jake. If you run across him you tell him I’m thinking about him…
1917,Laylea: Jake… Got it.
1918,Patty: Kyaaaaaaa! Stop! Get your hands off of me!
1919,"Shannan: Ugh... Look, I don't want to hurt you. Could you just give me that sword back?"
1920,Patty: Wait... give it back? Is it yours?
1921,"Shannan: Yes, it is! It's my family's ancestral blade, Balmung. I'm the only person capable of using it. You've nothing at all to gain from keeping it."
1922,"Patty: Wait, so how'd this thing end up in Aed, anyway?"
1923,"Shannan: It belonged to my father, who died in Grannvale's war with Isaach. Someone must've stolen it from him after he died. I only recently learned that it was being kept at Aed, so I came to retrieve it."
1924,"Patty: Hang on, hang on, hang on! Could it be... Are you Isaach's Prince Shannan?!"
1925,Shannan: I am...
1926,"Patty: Really? It's really, really you?! Wow! Oh my gosh, this is incredible!"
1927,Shannan: Er...
1928,"Patty: No, really, I've heard all the stories about you! All of them! I've been a huge fan of yours for so long, but I never thought I'd actually meet you!"
1929,Shannan: ...
1930,Patty: But you're here! You're really here talking to me right now! It's like all of my dreams've come true!
1931,"Shannan: ...Yeah, I think I get the idea. My sword, please."
1932,"Patty: Oh, right! Sorry. Here ya go!"
1933,Shannan: Balmung... My holy sword... It's finally mine... Hm? Ahh! What is this power...?!
1934,Patty: Wooow! This is incredible...
1935,"Oifey: Say, Diarmuid. You have a sister in Leonster, don't you?"
1936,"Diarmuid: Yes, sir. We were separated when we were very young. From what I've heard, she grew up with Sir Finn, a knight of Leonster."
1937,"Oifey: Sir Finn, you say... You're eager to have the chance to see her again, aren't you?"
1938,"Diarmuid: Yes, sir. I can hardly wait!"
1939,"Oifey: Heh. You'll have to give this battle your all first, then! How about a quick swordplay lesson?"
1940,"Diarmuid: Yes, sir! I'd appreciate that!"
1941,Seliph: Shannan! I'm so glad to see you've made it unscathed.
1942,"Shannan: Yeah, sorry to worry you like that. You went and took back Isaach behind my back, did you, Seliph? I can't thank you enough!"
1943,"Seliph: No, we'd still be in Tirnanog if not for you. You inspired us. You gave us your courage. If not for you, we could never have taken to the field!"
1944,"Shannan: Heh, you're starting to put on a bit of muscle there, aren't you? You're finally starting to..."
1945,Seliph: Shannan...?
1946,"Shannan: Hm? ...Oh, it's nothing. Pay me no mind, Seliph."
1947,"Seliph: Anyway, we're finally starting to challenge the Empire! Not bad, wouldn't you say?"
1948,"Shannan: Heh, not bad at all, Seliph! I've waited so long for this day... We all have, really."
1949,"Seliph: Thank you, Shannan!"
1950,Larcei: Prince Shannan! Whew... Glad to see you're still in one piece!
1951,"Shannan: Oh, Larcei! Sorry I wasn't around to see all this begin. From what I've heard, you've all had quite the tough time so far."
1952,"Larcei: Don't worry about it! The important part is that you're safe. I, er..."
1953,Shannan: How's your sword arm doing? Any stronger?
1954,"Larcei: Yeah, but still far below your prowess, sir."
1955,"Shannan: How about a quick lesson to patch that up? See, raw power isn't quite enough here. Try putting a bit more spirit into it... and swing!"
1956,"Larcei: Nnn-yah! Like this, sir...?"
1957,"Patty: Kyaaaaa! You're Lord Seliph! Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!"
1958,"Seliph: ...Oh? And who would you be, miss?"
1959,"Patty: I'm Patty, the one true love of Prince Shannan!"
1960,"Seliph: You're Shannan's...? Er, somehow, I doubt that."
1961,"Patty: Whoops... Okay, you caught me! I'm actually a thief! Well, I used to be. I've had enough of all that now. Now, I want to pitch in with your army instead!"
1962,"Seliph: Er... You aren't serious, are you? Military life is dangerous. There's no place for your ilk here."
1963,"Patty: Oh, you sound so sure! You barely have a coin to your name, but if you're gonna win this war, then nothing's more important than money. But with me around, you're not gonna have to worry about money ever again!"
1964,Seliph: I've no use for money obtained by theft.
1965,"Patty: ...You really have no idea, do you, sir? For every last coin carried by an Imperial soldier, there's a poor villager who they took it from. You can't look at all this and say that it's wrong for us to take that gold back! The people of this land've already lost so much... I... I just want to give something back..."
1966,"Seliph: I see... Er, my sincerest apologies, Patty."
1967,Patty: Sniff...
1968,"Seliph: Say, Patty: I'd like you to come with us."
1969,Patty: Huh? Really? D'you really mean that?!
1970,Seliph: But of course.
1971,"Patty: Th-thank you, sir! I promise I'll work as hard as I can for you! Oh, that reminds me! Here, take this sword. It's a little present, to commemorate us getting to know each other!"
1972,Seliph: Wow... This is a lovely blade!
1973,"Patty: It's one of those rare brave swords. And it's aaaaall yours, sir!"
1974,"Leif: Lord Seliph! What an honor it is to meet you at last. I'm Leif, the son of King Quan of Leonster."
1975,"Seliph: The honor is all mine, Prince Leif! I'm glad to see you've made it thus far unharmed."
1976,"Leif: My parents both died in the Battle of Belhalla's prelude... They were felled by a Thracian ambush. My homeland, Leonster, soon found itself in the clutches of an Imperial occupation, and fell under the reign of its Duke Bloom. If not for my knight, Finn, I wouldn't be here today. He raised me in hiding in nearby villages, and we awaited the day Leonster would rise again. We thought that day had finally come, but then..."
1977,"Seliph: ...We both took to the battlefield around the same time, did we not? By now practically all of Jugdral knows of King Bloom's brutality. I sorely wish my army had made it here sooner and could've properly aided you. You have my deepest apologies, Prince Leif."
1978,"Leif: No, Lord Seliph. I'm the one who should be apologizing. Our failure was squarely my fault. However, this isn't over. I am the son of Quan, a man worthy of being dubbed a Knight of Njörun. I refuse to put to shame his legacy, and so I'll live on. I'll fight on, no matter the cost. To that end, Lord Seliph, my comrades and I would like to join your army. I may not have much of an army left, but what I do have is yours. May we serve you well in restoring honor to Grannvale."
1979,"Seliph: Thank you, Prince Leif. Often I have heard it said that our fathers were inseparable friends, bound together to the bitter end in both life and death. Not to mention, your mother, Queen Ethlyn, is also my aunt... Both of your parents gave their lives to support my father's cause... Prince Leif, you have my deepest, most heartfelt apologies for their sacrifice..."
1980,"Leif: Thank you, but that isn't necessary. I am proud of my parents' sacrifice, and I've the utmost respect for Lord Sigurd. The only hatred I bear is for the true villains, Emperor Arvis and King Travant!"
1981,"Seliph: As do I... Prince Leif, in the name of our late fathers' last wishes, I seek to restore peace and light to all of Jugdral. Please, join me in my cause!"
1982,"Leif: Yes, sir! You have my blade as your own!"
1983,Diarmuid: Is your name by any chance Nanna?
1984,Nanna: Yeah. And who are you?
1985,"Diarmuid: Yes! I found you! I’m Diarmuid, your brother!"
1986,Nanna: Huh? Is this some kind of joke?
1987,"Diarmuid: Here, let me explain everything Lewyn told me. During the last war all us kids fled to Isaach. But then our mother, Lachesis, brought you here to Leonster just after you were born."
1988,"Nanna: If you’re my brother, then where is she now?"
1989,Diarmuid: You mean our mother?
1990,"Nanna: She left me when I was around 3 to meet up with you in Isaach, but she never came back. I’ve waited for her to come home ever since…"
1991,Diarmuid: Mother came for me? But… but I never saw her!
1992,"Nanna: Oh, no! What could’ve happened to her…"
1993,"Diarmuid: Well, first of all Aed Desert is no place for anyone to be traveling alone."
1994,"Nanna: Oh, no… Poor mother!"
1995,"Tristan: Excuse me. You wouldn't happen to be Jeanne, would you?"
1996,Jeanne: I am. And you are?
1997,"Tristan: Perfect! I've finally found you! I'm your brother, Tristan!"
1998,Jeanne: Huh?! What... You can't be serious!
1999,"Tristan: I'm being completely serious! See, our father was a knight of House Nordion. When we were both still little, he was killed in the Agustrian civil war, and we were adopted by Lord Sigurd's army. We later fled to Isaach with Sir Oifey, but we somehow lost you along the way..."
2000,"Jeanne: Huh... That actually fits. I was adopted by a travelling merchant, who once said he found me in Isaach."
2001,Tristan: Yeah... Sir Oifey's always said he wondered if something like that happened.
2002,"Jeanne: But then, when I was just seven years old, some Imperial thug murdered him... That's when Finn found and adopted me."
2003,"Tristan: Wow... that sounds just awful. I'm sorry you had to deal with that, Jeanne."
2004,"Jeanne: No, it's okay. I mean, now I have you! I'm so happy I finally have a brother... Thank you, Tristan! Let's never be parted again..."
2005,"Ares: Seliph... At long last, it's you..."
2006,Seliph: Hm? And who would you be?
2007,"Ares: They call me the Black Knight, Ares... Perhaps you would recognize me better, however, as the son of Eldigan."
2008,"Seliph: Huh?! It cannot be... You don't mean the legendary Lord Eldigan of Nordion, do you?!"
2009,"Ares: The very same! I am the son of Eldigan the Lionheart, the man whom your father killed in coldest blood! My noble mother, the Lady Grahnye, died wracked with grief and rage at Sigurd! It is high time you knew my family's pain!"
2010,"Seliph: That's... I don't understand, Ares. As I understood it, your father and mine were the closest of friends. As tragic as their end was, I don't believe our fathers could ever have begrudged each other."
2011,Ares: That's impossible... Sigurd was my father's mortal foe! This... This is all I've know my entire life...
2012,"Seliph: Please listen, Ares. Would you consider joining my army? I know we can resolve this misunderstanding, if we just give it some time. I hold the late Lord Eldigan in the utmost respect, just as my own father did. Please, Ares. Please understand this."
2013,"Ares: Seliph... Very well. I suppose I can stay my hand for now. However, be warned. Should I learn that even a single word of your claims is false, your life is forfeit in your father's place. Do I make myself clear, Seliph?"
2014,"Seliph: If that happens, then do as you must. Ares... I wish you could know just how ecstatic our fathers would be to know we've met at last! If only we'd met under better circumstances..."
2015,"Lene: Mister Seliph, right? Nice to meet ya!"
2016,Seliph: Er... Hello. And who are you?
2017,"Lene: I'm Lene, the dancer!"
2018,Seliph: You... You're Lene?
2019,"Lene: Ohh? Mister Seliph, is this the first time you've ever seen a dancer?"
2020,"Seliph: Y-yes, miss..."
2021,Lene: Hee hee... That's adorable!
2022,"Tine: Um... Pardon me, sir..."
2023,"Seliph: Hm? And who are you, ma'am?"
2024,Tine: I am Tine... Arthur's sister...
2025,"Seliph: Ah, of course. I've been told your story, Tine."
2026,Tine: Um... I'm sorry!
2027,"Seliph: You've nothing to apologize for, Tine. With the likes of King Bloom for an uncle, I completely understand. You had no choice."
2028,"Tine: Are... are you forgiving me, sir?"
2029,"Seliph: Certainly! There's no question that you're not our enemy, and it would be an honor to have you with us."
2030,Tine: Wow... You're every thing the stories say you are! I wish we could've met sooner...
2031,"Seliph: Heh... Thank you! Listen, Tine. I know fighting your own family is a painful prospect, so please, don't force yourself if you're at all uncomfortable."
2032,Tine: Sir...
2033,"Finn: Nanna, how’re you holding up?"
2034,"Nanna: I’m fine, father. You don’t need to worry about me."
2035,"Finn: Your strong determination reminds me more of Lachesis each passing day, Nanna."
2036,"Nanna: Father, if you loved mother so much, how could you have let her go all by herself!?"
2037,"Finn: To Isaach? Nanna, I’ve asked you before not to bring that up. …That’s between your mother and I."
2038,Nanna: But…
2039,Finn: You’ll understand someday. Just wait till you’re a little older.
2040,Finn: Who are you?
2041,"Lana: I’m Lana. You’re Finn, right?"
2042,Finn: You…
2043,Lana: What’s the matter? Please don’t look at me like that. You’re embarrassing me!
2044,"Finn: Ah, forgive me. You just remind me so much of someone I once knew."
2045,Lana: I do?
2046,"Finn: Yes. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you are the spitting image of a woman I once loved."
2047,Lana: I see. Were you two a couple?
2048,"Finn: Yes, but we got separated during the war, and I haven’t seen her since."
2049,"Lana: Oh, how sad… What was the woman’s name?"
2050,Finn: Edain… You’re the first I’ve met to parallel her beauty.
2051,Lana: Edain!? That’s my mother!
2052,Finn: Who are you?
2053,Larcei: Hm? I’m Larcei.
2054,Finn: This can’t be…
2055,"Larcei: What’s the problem? Hey, don’t look at me like that. You’re embarrassing me!"
2056,"Finn: Ah, forgive me. You just remind me so much of someone I once knew."
2057,Larcei: I do?
2058,"Finn: Yes. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you are the spitting image of a woman I once loved."
2059,Larcei: Oh. So were you two a couple?
2060,"Finn: Yes, but we got separated during the war, and I haven’t seen her since."
2061,"Larcei: Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. What was her name?"
2062,Finn: Ayra… You’re the first I’ve met to parallel her beauty.
2063,Larcei: …Ayra? You sure about that!?

2065,"The two faces of the Thracian Peninsula are as distance as night and day. The peninsula's north, once ruled by several small kingdoms, is graced with rich pastures, while the south, the Kingdom of Thracia, is a harsh wasteland dominated by vast mountains. In ages past, seeking to claim the life-giving northern land as their own, Thracia's infamous wyvern knights have led countless brash attempts to conquer the north, only to be repelled at every turn by the might of House Leonster. Thracia looked to have won at last following their slaughter of Leonster's army in the Aed Desert, only to be defeated in turn by Bloom of Friege, who claimed the land as his own. And so, the so-called Kingdom of Northern Thracia was born as yet another servant of the Empire. Over a decade has passed since then. Not even Thracia's King Travant, an ambitious man with a thirst for power and glory, dares to challenge the will of the Empire, and so a strange peace looms over the region. Or so it did, until the arrival of Seliph and his liberation army. Bloom's defeat at his own castle has abruptly tipped the balance of the Thracian stalemate. Both the Ulster and Leonster territories now lie under the liberation army's control, forcing Bloom to retreat to Conote and muster the strength to take Ulster back. The southern Munster Castle, governed by the ""Goddess of Thunder"", Princess Ishtar, braces itself for the threat of Thracian invaders. Meanwhile, across the border itself, both King Travant and his border watchman, General Maykov of Meath Castle, remain eerily silent. The people are united in their fondest wish: for the entirety of the Thracian Peninsula to return to the rule of House Leonster. And so dawns yet another battle...
"
2066,Bloom: Nngh... Curses! Never did I imagine that the rebels could pose such a threat. Vampa! How could the three of you let yourselves be cowed into fleeing? What a disgrace!
2067,"Vampa: A thousand apologies, milord. However, you've nothing to worry about anymore. Even as we speak, General Muhammad prepares his brigade to lay siege to Ulster, and General Ovo's cavalry are en route to Leonster. We, too, shall rejoin the fray shortly."
2068,Bloom: Hrm... Don't you dare fail me this time. And what of King Travant? Why are the promised Thracian reinforcements nowhere to be seen?
2069,Vampa: We've yet to receive any response to any of our messengers so far.
2070,Bloom: Gah... What in blazes is that snake thinking?
2071,Vampa: King Travant is an ambitious man. To blindly trust him would be foolish.
2072,"Bloom: No matter. Even without his forces, we've more than enough power to stop the rebels cold. Vampa! Fetra! Eliu! Move out at once. This time, leave not a single rebel alive!"
2073,"Vampa: Yes, milord. We will not fail."
2074,"Man: Sir Ced, please! We all can't take much more of King Bloom's abuses! How long... How long will it be until Munster is free from the Empire?"
2075,"Ced: Don't lose hope now! Even as we speak, Lord Seliph and his liberators are out there fighting for the District. They'll be here before long. Go! Tell your friends and family that your freedom is so very nearly in reach! Please, my friends, believe me. Munster's freedom is fast approaching!"
2076,"Arion: Pardon me, Father, but King Bloom is requesting our aid yet again. The Empire has already lost both Ulster and Leonster to the Isaach rebels. He wishes to use us to help reclaim them."
2077,"Travant: The Isaach rebels are led by that Seliph brat... Sigurd's spawn, correct? Heh... Poor, poor Bloom. He's getting so old, even little children are a thorn in his side! Pay Bloom no heed, Arion. The Empire and the rebels are best left to break themselves on each other for now. We'll mop up the leftovers once they're nice and weak."
2078,"Arion: I should have known, Father... All along, you've been waiting out Bloom's little storm, haven't you?"
2079,"Travant: But of course! It'd make no sense to bend over backward for the man who snatched our hard-won north out from under our noses, would it? Leonster's downfall should have meant a peninsula unified under our rule... I'll neither forgive nor forget Bloom's craven conquest."
2080,"Arion: Even now, we still lack the power to truly match Grannvale on an even battlefield... I can only image your frustration, Father."
2081,"Travant: Thracia's fate depends on a unified peninsula. The verdant northern soils are the perfect cure for the famine and poverty wracking our south. We've been shunned and vilified for centuries, dismissed as ravenous hyenas... Yet what choice did we ever have? If not for our answer to this world's craving for sellswords, Thracia would ever have had the funds to barely survive as we do. We've toiled in poverty long enough, Arion. It's high time Thracia carved itself a future! A future, I might add, which depends on the outcome of the game laid before us..."
2082,Arion: Mm.
2083,"Lewyn: I have a bad feeling about this, Seliph... Is Leonster well guarded?"
2084,"Seliph: I believe so, but then again, reinforcing it further certainly wouldn't hurt. Should I send them some support?"
2085,"Lewyn: Do it. With Bloom still on the loose in Conote, there's no sense in skimping on the defenses. Oh, and also, we've received a plea for help from the people of Munster Castle. The sooner our forces reach them, the better."
2086,Seliph: Very well. We shall make the first move!
2087,"Muhammad: Move in on Ulster Castle! We've nothing to fear from these rebels! If anyone dares to question my command, come forth and allow me to relieve your neck of your head! ...No volunteers? Good. Attack!"
2088,"Ovo: Good, everything's ready. Men, we tear through Leonster's defenses in one fell swoop! We'll not let Muhammad's men put us to shame!"
2089,"Vampa: It is time, then... Fetra, Eliu, shall we proceed? We've no room for error this time."
2090,"Febail: What do you want, Bloom?"
2091,"Bloom: Ah, Febail. So you came after all. I've been waiting for you."
2092,"Febail: Look, Bloom. I'm a busy man. Tell me what you want, or I'm leaving."
2093,Bloom: Tch... Listen carefully. I've an employment opportunity for you.
2094,Febail: ...An employment opportunity?
2095,"Bloom: Yes, Febail. I require your services in putting down the rebel army."
2096,"Febail: Pass. I might be a mercenary, but I'm certainly not about to do your dirty work."
2097,"Bloom: Oh, really? Then what will become of all those orphans in your care? Rumor has it your dear sister has taken to stealing the money you need to take care of them. Are you content with such a life?"
2098,Febail: I guess you're right... I dunno if I can take Patty risking her life like this much longer. And we do sorely need the gold...
2099,"Bloom: Bring me Seliph's head, Febail, and you'll have all the gold your orphans will ever need and more. Your dear sister would approve."
2100,"Febail: ...Deal. I know this'll come back to bite me, but if it means saving the kids... You have my bow... just this once."
2101,"Ishtar: You summoned me, Father? How might I be of assistance?"
2102,Bloom: Ishtar! What kept you so long? The rebels are preparing to launch another attack on me any moment now! I-I need you to protect me!
2103,"Ishtar: What's happened, Father? How could a pack of simple rebels get to you of all people? This is so very unlike you..."
2104,"Bloom: These are no mere rebels! They've already slaughtered Ishtore, and Tine is lost to us as well because of them... They've already defeated Vampa and her sister... I can't leave this task to them again. You're all I have left to depend upon!"
2105,"Ishtar: Understood, but I have one condition. I need the Book of Mjölnir. If I'm wielding Mjölnir, I won't need an army with me. I alone will be more than enough."
2106,Bloom: W-what?! You... want me to hand it over... Fine. Very well... You can take Mjölnir... But don't you dare fail me now!
2107,"Ishtar: You can trust me, Father. By your leave."
2108,Patty: Hang on... Febail?! What d'you think you're doing? Ugh... Don't tell me you actually let Bloom buy out your bow arm!
2109,Febail: Patty? Wait... Why are you with the rebels?
2110,"Patty: To protect people, of course! We've come this far working together, and I know we're gonna stop Bloom for good! I don't get it. Did you just go and forget everything? That if it wasn't for the Empire's cruelty, none of the kids would be orphans? But no, here you are, kissing up to the very same man who ruined all our friends' lives! What the heck were you thinking, Febail?"
2111,"Febail: You're absolutely right... I'm so sorry, Patty. I guess I just wasn't thinking at all."
2112,"Patty: Any scumbag can apologize till their blue in the face! If you're really sorry, then get over here! Come help us fight for peace!"
2113,"Febail: Alright, Patty. I'm with you. You've certainly come a long way lately..."
2114,Patty: Hee hee... I guess I have!
2115,Julius: Ishtar. Return with me to Belhalla. You've no business dying in a place like this.
2116,Ishtar: Oh! Lord Julius... ...But why are you-
2117,"Julius: Come, Ishtar. I need you."
2118,"Ishtar: Y-yes, milord! Anything you wish!"
2119,"Lewyn: Looks like we just dealt a critical blow to the Empire's control of the area, Seliph. Their survivors are fleeing in droves!"
2120,Seliph: Excellent! I suspect liberating Munster has become far simpler than we'd hoped.
2121,Lewyn: Don't get too excited just yet. The real problem here is still Thracia.
2122,"Seliph: What makes you think so? What would cause Thracia to break neutrality now, of all times?"
2123,"Lewyn: You've never had to deal with King Travant before, have you? Just ask Prince Leif. If not for Travant, he would still have his parents. Travant's murder of them was a cruel ambush, an insult to the honor of a knight like Quan. Who knows what dirty game he's planning now..."
2124,"Travant: Bloom's gone and died, has he? Heh heh... At last! Thracia has been scrubbed clean of the Imperial taint! Now's our chance to help ourselves to the north, starting with Munster! Altena! I leave the capture of Munster to you. I'll send General Coulter with you. If anyone stands in your way, suppress them without a second thought. I don't care if it's a little kid with a wooden stick. Cut them down!"
2125,"Altena: Hold on a moment, Father! I'm as eager to challenge the Empire as you are, but killing innocents makes no sense at all! We'd be much better served forging an alliance with the liberators. We're already surrounded by enemies. Why make more?"
2126,Travant: Altena! I have no interest in one of your little lectures. Keep your mouth shut and do as you're told!
2127,"Altena: But, Father-"
2128,"Arion: Please, Altena. Just listen to him. Father and I must return to the capital. We've some further preparations to make. Best of luck holding our border, Altena."
2129,"Altena: Arion... Very well, I'll do it..."
2130,Travant: Then don't waste your time dawdling! Go!
2131,"Travant: She's finally gone? Good... Stubborn little thing, isn't she? I haven't seen a woman so brash since her mother... Quite the family resemblance there!"
2132,"Arion: Father, surely you must realize that Altena means you no ill will. You needn't be so harsh on her."
2133,"Travant: Yes, that much is obvious, thank you! ...Let's head back to the capital, Arion. We need to ready the army to claim this peninsula as ours, once and for all! Maykov! Meath Castle is in your hands. Work with Altena's unit and defend the border, no matter what happens!"
2134,"Maykov: Understood, milord!"
2135,"Man: Dire news, Sir Ced! Thracia's dispatched a wyvern knight unit from Meath, and they're coming our way!"
2136,"Ced: Just our luck... We've only just finally cleared the Empire out of Munster, and now we've got Thracia to grapple with as well?! I suppose it was only a matter of time before Travant showed his true colors..."
2137,"Man: The liberation army's sure to want to aid us, but they still haven't crossed the river! What do we do?"
2138,Ced: Everyone! Get out of here and run for Conote! I'll stay here and fend off the wyvern knights for as long as I can.
2139,"Young woman: B-but that's impossible, Sir Ced! Not even you could survive a wyvern knight assault by yourself!"
2140,"Ced: I know, but I won't risk any lives but my own. Don't worry. I won't go down without bringing few Thracians with me! Go on, please! We've no time to waste!"
2141,Young woman: Sir Ced...
2142,"Coulter: Is everything ready, my liege? We'll be closing in on Munster shortly. Let's waste no time in besieging them!"
2143,"Altena: Hold, Coulter! Those are nothing more than common citizens standing in our way. Killing them would be the foulest of crimes. Wait here with the squad. I'll see if I can negotiate a surrender."
2144,"Coulter: You know I can't do that. My orders come from over your head. You may spout all the lovely nonsense you wish, but the king forbids me to stay my hand."
2145,"Altena: Are you questioning a direct order from your commander and your princess, General?!"
2146,"Coulter: These are my men, princess! If you don't wish to partake yourself, then stand aside, make yourself useful and watch our backs! Now, then... Is everyone ready? All hands, prepare to strike Munster! Leave no survivors!"
2147,Altena: C-Coulter! Get back here at once!
2148,"Seliph: Ced the Brave, I presume? I couldn't possibly thank you enough for all you've done for the people of Munster."
2149,"Ced: Lord Seliph... I'm so glad you're here at last. Sire, I implore you! Save this world! Too many of us have already given into despair... The city of Munster has been robbed by the Empire of countless young children. All were sent to the shrines in Miletos... I... I couldn't save even a single child. Me, brave? Hah! I hardly deserve such a lofty label. I'm just another coward..."
2150,"Seliph: That isn't true, Ced! If I were to fight alone, I know that there'd be precious little that I could do. It was uniting the strength of my friends, a team effort, which brought us this far! And I believe that your strength could be a valuable part of our cause. Please, Ced the Brave. Grant us your power!"
2151,"Ced: Thank you, sire... You'll have my loyalty, no matter what!"
2152,"Maykov: The rebels have made it to Munster? What in the blazes is Princess Altena doing? Men! Bolster our defensive line! Until His Majesty the King returns, we must protect the border at all costs!"
2153,"Seliph: The Thracians are on such a different level to anybody we've fought before, Lewyn. It almost feels as if each blow is fueled by pure desperation..."
2154,"Lewyn: See, Thracia's always had a bad lot in life. Much of its land is consumed by mountains. Farming its own food is a near impossible task, so they struggle to keep themselves fed. Thracia's men seek mercenary work to find the money to stay alive, while its women are stuck in whatever dreary jobs they can dig up. Don't get me wrong, Seliph. King Travant is still an awful man, but there's far more than his own petty gain at stake in his schemes. The Thracian army is as loyal to Travant as they come. They ardently believe it's Travant who'll guide Thracia out of its endless famine."
2155,Seliph: I see... That does make sense...
2156,"Lewyn: The thing is, no amount of poverty will ever justify Thracia's aggression. Travant's brand of nobility and justice would never be accepted anywhere else in the world. All the peninsula's north can see are rowdy aggressors, who threaten their peaceful lives. As harsh as it may seem, Seliph, I trust you know you can't afford to stay your hand here. The Thracian royal family is the enemy, and a grave threat to the north's peace. Stripping them of power is the only choice. That task falls to us, and we can't fail now."
2157,"Altena: The liberators have seized Meath?! Could I have been wrong about them? Oh, Arion..."
2158,Young man: You're with Lord Seliph's liberators? Gods be praised! You've come at last.
2159,"Young man: We're saved! Oh, thank you!"
2160,Young man: Three cheers for Lord Seliph!
2161,"Young woman: Thank you so much, noble warrior!"
2162,"Young woman: Please, we beg of you... Do all you can to help sir Ced!"
2163,"Young woman: Thracia's wyvern knights are still on the prowl 'round these parts. Be careful, won't you..."
2164,"Man: I've heard tell that over in Munster, people're planning a revolt against the Imperial rule. Apparently the ringleader there's some Silessian mage called Ced... The people there are so sure that he's the man for the job. Of course, the real problem for Munster is that Thracia's got their grubby eyes on the city... I hope they'll be alright."
2165,"Young woman: Ohh, thank you so much! I've heard all the stories about your army, and I've been praying that you'd come someday. Lord Seliph is our beacon of hope! Here, take this power ring. It's not much, but it's all we have to show our gratitude."
2166,"Woman: For as long as anyone can recall, Thracia's wanted to claim this region as their own. And for just as long, House Leonster always stood in their way, wielding their holy lance Gáe Bolg to defend our lands. At least, until Gáe Bolg was lost a decade ago in the Aed Desert... The Thracians ambushed and murdered Prince Quan, his wife Ethlyn, and their daughter Altena as they crossed Aed, and the lance vanished..."
2167,"Villager: The Kingdom of Thracia was founded by a wyvern knight named Dáinn. He took the Divine Gungnir in hand and took on the devil himself. Supposedly the founder of the Leonster Kingdom, Crusader Njörun, was Dáinn’s younger sister."
2168,"Old woman: Hoo hoo! What brings you all the way out here? You must be quite the curious one! Either way, I want to thank you for coming all this way for such a small and remote town. This here trinket's a thief's band. She's an odd little thing: slip her on and you'll soon find yourself stealing like you've done it all your life. Hoo hoo hoo! Take care of yourself, dearie."
2169,"Young woman: Long ago, Thracia and the states of the Munster District were a single nation. 'Course, you'd never know that from how they've hated each other so for as long as anyone can recall! I wish they could just try to make peace..."
2170,"Young man: Gaah! I-I don't believe it... The Conote Hitman's back for more blood! Run, everyone! Run for it!"
2171,Asaello: ...
2172,Girl: ...
2173,"Asaello: Er... Shouldn't you be running, too?"
2174,"Girl: But you look so sad, mister..."
2175,Asaello: ...I do?
2176,Girl: Take these! We picked up all these fruits in the woods. Eat 'em! They'll make you grow up big and strong! I hope you feel better soon!
2177,"Asaello: Thanks, kid..."
2178,"Fee: Whew! What a view, huh? I wonder if I can spot Ced from here... Hey, you alright, Annand? Ready to fly yet? Y'know, Annand, you're named for my aunt... She was one of the greatest Silessian heroines. I bet that name's why you just don't give up. Don't you worry. The very instant everything's peaceful again, We'll be going right back home to Silesse! And once it's all done... Hee hee! Maybe I'll find someone really cute, and we'll spend the rest of our lives together! But I guess we've got a little more work to do before the guys or girls come along! Come on, Annand!"
2179,Muirne: Sir Seliph…
2180,"Seliph: Muirne, what’s the problem?"
2181,"Muirne: I know I was all pumped up when we left Isaach, but now I’m… I’m scared. Just seeing everybody fighting and all… Well, one of us is gonna get killed sooner or later."
2182,Seliph: Muirne…
2183,"Muirne: Sir Seliph, you saw that mage, didn’t you? She just vanished into thin air! I just sense an evil power at work here that may just be beyond all of us!"
2184,"Seliph: Muirne, to be honest, I’m scared too. Some nights I can’t even get any sleep… Some days I wish I could just pack up and get out of here! But I can’t… and I won’t. You saw the people at Ulster and Conote. They cried with joy when we liberated them! That just goes to show how cruel the empire’s rule has been on them. We can’t just leave things the way they are. We need to help out any way we can."
2185,"Muirne: I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t mean to make you worry. I’ll try a little harder. But please be extra careful, okay? If we ever lost you….."
2186,"Seliph: Thanks, Muirne. I… I feel the same for you."
2187,Muirne: Sir Seliph…
2188,Leif: Hold on a moment. Over there... Is that a wyvern knight dame? She has such a sad look in her eyes...
2189,Jake: Wow! A human! I’m saved!!
2190,Linda: What are you doing way back in here?
2191,"Jake: Well, I initially set out t’join the liberation army, but I got lost. What’s your story?"
2192,Linda: I’m fighting to restore peace to the land with Sir Seliph.
2193,"Jake: You’re a member of the liberation army!? Hahahaa! T’think I’d find you guys here! Actually, I was just on my way home. This hurts to admit, but I kinda scared myself out here. I’m sure my girl Anna is plenty worried about me, too."
2194,"Linda: Oh, that’s a shame you can’t fight with us."
2195,Jake: Yeah. Problem is I go pretty stiff ’round them ballistas. I wouldn’t have been much help to y’all had I joined anyhow. So… you have a name?
2196,"Linda: Yes, it’s Linda."
2197,"Jake: Linda? Hmm… Where have I’ve heard that name before? Well, I should get moving. Here’s an amulet for ya. I won’t be needing it anymore."
2198,Linda: Thank you…
2199,Jake: Good luck to ya and may the grace of Naga be with you!
2200,Jake: Wow! Another human! I’m saved!!
2201,Amid: What happened to you?
2202,"Jake: Ahh… it’s a long story. Anyway, I was lost, you see… Lucky for me this girl named Linda showed up and got me on the right path. And then… well, this hurts to admit, but I got lost all over again!"
2203,Amid: Is that right? Linda is my sister. I’m Amid. I’ll get you in the right direction.
2204,"Jake: You’re Linda’s brother!? Hahahaa! Of all places to meet… I’m worthless, I tell ya."
2205,"Amid: Look, just stick with me and you’ll be fine. If an enemy shows up get behind me, okay?"
2206,"Jake: Ahh, you’re a good person. You and your sister alike."
2207,"Amid: Well, you’d do the same for me if I were in trouble."
2208,"Jake: I’m not kidding, friend… You’re like as good as they come. Here, I’ve got an amulet for you too. I brought an extra one just in case. Heh heh…"
2209,Amid: Thank you. That’s very thoughtful of you.
2210,"Jake: Once I get home to Anna, we are gonna have ourselves some kids just like y’all!"
2211,"Amid: Well, before that we need to get over these mountains. Follow me."
2212,"Jake: Hey, wait up!"
2213,Julia: Lord Seliph...
2214,"Seliph: Oh, Julia. Is something the matter?"
2215,Julia: I... I'm scared... I sense an evil presence... Something dark... And it's closing in...
2216,Seliph: What do you mean?
2217,Julia: (slowly) ...Seliph... Be on your guard... Ishtar is a fierce foe... You cannot fight her... You must not...
2218,Seliph: Julia! What's happening to you?!
2219,Julia: Ahh... I... W-what in the world just...?
2220,Seliph: Julia... You're...
2221,"Arthur: You need to be careful, Fee. I know you can fly and all, but that doesn't mean you should just take off by yourself."
2222,"Fee: Oh? Are my ears playing tricks on me? Could it be you're actually worried about me, Arthur?"
2223,"Arthur: Er... Yeah, I suppose so."
2224,Fee: Hmmm! Who knew you had it in you? I never would've guessed that you're even able to worry about anyone but yourself! I might have to rethink everything just a bit!
2225,"Arthur: Well, er, you're something of a special case..."
2226,Fee: Huh?
2227,"Arthur: Er, never mind! Anyway, just don't do anything too rash, alright? See you..."
2228,Fee: Arthur...
2229,"Finn: Lord Leif, the protection of the peninsula realm is our duty as House Leonster's remnants. We aren't in for an easy battle, but no matter what happens, we must persevere."
2230,"Leif: I know, Finn. I've always dreamed that this day, the day of Leonster's freedom, would come... I'll do all I can to bring peace to the peninsula and save the people from King Bloom's tyranny. To fulfill Father's final wishes at last... And if I need to lay down my life to make our dream a reality, then so be it..."
2231,"Finn: Please, my lord! It ill befits a future king to do something so rash! You mustn't say such things!"
2232,"Leif: Er, you're right... Sorry, Finn. I know how hard you had to work to protect me from the Empire's pursuit in my youth. I recall how often you'd let yourself starve, just so I wouldn't have to go without food... All my life you've made sacrifice after sacrifice for my sake, and only now do I understand this... I'll always be grateful for all you've done, Finn."
2233,"Finn: My lord, the Thracian region has been plagued by strife for generations, but your father dared to dream of uniting it under a lasting peace. He may be gone, but you still yet live, and so too does the hope of fulfilling his dream. Only you stand a chance of uniting Thracia."
2234,"Febail: Prince Seliph? Please, sir, forgive my foolishness!"
2235,"Seliph: Febail, yes? Patty has already told me your story. Relax! I understand why you did what you did. You've nothing to worry about."
2236,"Febail: I don't think so, sir. Letting myself work for the very same Empire I've supposedly been opposing? That was shamefully half-witted of me... Sir, I swear I'll make up for my bad choices. I'll do everything I can to aid you!"
2237,"Seliph: Thank you, Febail. I'm glad to have you."
2238,"Seliph: Pardon me, Tine. I don't suppose you're acquainted with Princess Ishtar?"
2239,"Tine: I am... When I was growing up, Ishtar was like a sister to me. She was one of the few who treated me well..."
2240,"Seliph: Would you have any idea who the man who came to collect her was, then?"
2241,Tine: That... was most likely Prince Julius.
2242,Seliph: The crown prince himself?! Are you certain?
2243,"Tine: I think so, yes. The two are a couple. That would be why he..."
2244,"Seliph: Have you met Prince Julius before, then?"
2245,"Tine: Once or twice, when I visited Belhalla. He... How can I put this... He has this odd charm which draws people to him... only for them to find that he's colder than ice. He's terrifying! If I didn't know better, I would swear he isn't even human..."
2246,Nanna: Are you Ares?
2247,"Ares: Yeah, what do you need?"
2248,Nanna: I heard you’re King Eldigan’s son. Is that true?
2249,"Ares: Yeah, so what about it?"
2250,"Nanna: It is you, after all! I am Nanna… I’m the daughter of King Eldigan’s sister!"
2251,Ares: What? You’re Lachesis’ daughter!?
2252,Nanna: Yes! She was so worried about you for the longest time… That must have been why she came to Leonster. She was looking for you!
2253,Ares: My father knew Agustria was about to be engulfed in war. So he sent me and my frail mother to her parent’s residence in Leonster. But I lost my dear mother to the flames of war during the empire’s invasion of Leonster.
2254,Nanna: And that’s when you went with Javarro?
2255,"Ares: Yeah, he took me in after that, and I traveled the world with his mercenary troops."
2256,"Nanna: No wonder we never met… Ares, I have something for you."
2257,Ares: What… Is that from my father!?
2258,"Nanna: Yes. My mother passed it on to me. It’s addressed to you, Ares."
2259,Ares: …!!
2260,Nanna: See… Sir Sigurd never once betrayed King Eldigan’s trust. I’m sure they were good friends till the very end.
2261,Ares: Whoa… I’ve had it wrong all this time.
2262,"Nanna: Ares, keep Sir Seliph safe, okay? He needs you on his side more than anything!"
2263,"Ares: Yeah… I’ll do that, Nanna. Hey, I’ll teach you some sword fighting tactics before you go. Now watch carefully…"
2264,"Ced: Huh?! Er, pardon me, Lord Seliph, but... ...That man standing by your side..."
2265,"Seliph: Ah, Ced. I'd like you to meet Lewyn, my tactician."
2266,Ced: Lewyn? I knew it. That's my father...
2267,"Lewyn: Oh, Ced. I guess you've found me. Been a while, huh? How's things?"
2268,"Ced: How's things? HOW'S THINGS?! Father, don't you realize? I've been searching for you for all this time! Do you even realize how long it's been since you ran away from home?"
2269,"Lewyn: Oh, yeah. I guess it has been a few years... Hey, how's Erinys doing these days?"
2270,Ced: How dare you... Mother is DEAD! All we ever wanted was for her to see you one last time before she died... That's why I've been looking for you!
2271,"Lewyn: Huh... Erinys... Such a shame, too..."
2272,"Ced: Are you capable of any emotion at all, Father?! You just heard your wife's dead, and you won't so much as shed a tear... And what about Fee? You've hurt her so much! It still pains her... She's adamant that she won't speak to you. You've known she was here all along, Father. Why didn't you try to fix this?"
2273,"Lewyn: Look, Ced. I left my old life behind long ago for a reason. That goes for my wife and kids, too. End of story. That's all there is to it."
2274,Ced: ...Father?!
2275,Fee: Ced...? Cedsy! It IS you!
2276,Ced: Fee?! What are you doing here? Is something the matter?
2277,"Fee: I've been looking for you, of course! I mean, you've been gone from Silesse for so long, and we had no idea where you were!"
2278,"Ced: I know, Fee, and I'm sorry... See, what happened was I was passing through Munster in my search for Father. I would've moved on, but the people's plight was nothing short of heartbreaking. I couldn't just leave Munster to waste away..."
2279,"Fee: I should've known. That is so like you, Cedsy! And here I was, almost starting to forget why you're so incredible."
2280,"Ced: You're with the liberation army, then?"
2281,Fee: Yep! I just knew I had to help Lord Seliph.
2282,Ced: Is that so... You're even more like Mother than I thought! Not once in her life did she ever turn her back on someone in need.
2283,"Fee: You're just like her, too, Cedsy... Poor Mom, though. Just thinking about how Dad left her... It makes me so mad!"
2284,Ced: Mm... I still can't make sense of his actions. What could he have possibly been thinking...
2285,"Hermina: Hawk? Is that you!? It’s me, your sister!"
2286,Hawk: Hermina!? What’s going on? What are you doing here?
2287,Hermina: I’m here looking for you! What could I do… You never once returned home after you left!
2288,"Hawk: I’m sorry, Hermina. I wandered into Munster while looking for our father, and the people were so bad off I just couldn’t leave them."
2289,"Hermina: That’s just like something you’d do, Hawk. No wonder I love you so much."
2290,"Hawk: So you joined the liberation army, did you?"
2291,Hermina: Yep. I wanted to help out Sir Seliph.
2292,Hawk: Hmph… I’m not surprised. You’ve admired his father ever since you were little.
2293,Hermina: Yeah. My dream has always been to become a Pegasus Knight just like Erinys was. You just watch… I’m gonna make it!

2296,"Chapter 9: For Whose Sake
"
2297,"With the liberation of the peninsula's north, Seliph's liberation army occupies Mease Castle as their headquarters, uncertain of how to next act. Beyond Mease and the engulfing maw of its peaks lies the dracoknights' kingdom, Thracia. This rural nation is ruled by King Travant, who remains bound in coalition to Emperor Arvis. Thracia is the only state anywhere in Jugdral regarded as an ally by the Grannvale Empire. Within Thracia, Travant's minions await Seliph: his children, Altena and Arion, at the capital; the legendary General Hannibal, dubbed ""Thracia's Shield"", at Kapathogia Castle; the king's trusted advisor, General Disler, at Luthecia Castle; and a Loptyrian agent from the Empire, Bishop Judah, at Grutia Castle. Travant has fortified his kingdom for one final, full-scale showdown with the liberators. Thracia's people hardly offer Seliph an eager welcome. Fearing Seliph as a conqueror, they flock in droves to take up arms themselves. How could any justice lie in this conflict? For whose sake is this war being fought? For the first time, these questions now shake both Seliph and his army's resolve to the core...
"
2298,"Villager:
"
2299,"“I can’t verify this, but word is the empire is sending reinforcements this way. They say Musar is commanding them. Apparently, his father was killed by a Silessian knight among your ranks. He has it in for you all, so you better be on the lookout.”
"
2300,"Oh, hey! You've gone and sorted out them Imperial reinforcements already? Wow... I'm pretty dang impressed!
"
2301,"Travant: ALTENA!! What was that sorry display? Why, pray tell, is Manster still standing?!"
2302,Altena: Father... I...
2303,"Travant: I've no interest in any more excuses! Don't you dare belittle me, Altena. You are a warrior beyond compare, and you and Arion embody my will beyond these walls. I expect no less than for you to do your duty! And what do I find instead? You've ignored my orders, left an entire platoon to the slaughter, and strolled home as if nothing ever happened! I've never been more disappointed..."
2304,"Altena: I'm sorry, Father, but at least let me explain! I could never agree with such tactics, which enrich us at the expense of everybody else! How could you ever expect the proud Thracian people to accept prosperity built on the bones of others? Please, Father, rethink your ways!"
2305,"Arion: Enough, Altena. There's no place here for such meddling. Still your tongue and obey Father! Father, bear in mind Altena is still young and unseasoned. I suspect she merely found the last battle too overwhelming a prospect. Please do forgive her, even just this once."
2306,"Travant: You know, Arion? If you'd just hold back on the coddling, perhaps Altena wouldn't be so stubborn! Look, Altena. I'll give you one last chance. Take a dracoknight platoon and retake Mease! If you so much as slip again, then daughter be damned, I will accept no excuses! Understood?"
2307,"Altena: Yes, Father..."
2308,"Travant: Whew... Family resemblance, indeed! It's plainly obvious that she loathes me..."
2309,"Arion: Father, you have to remember that she's still a child. Like all children, she has yet to realize her thoughtless words have real effects."
2310,"Travant: Hmph, I suppose... I'm off to Kapathogia. I hear Hannibal's found himself some funny ideas about my plans. And so it falls to me to ensure he loses those ideas before somebody gets hurt..."
2311,Arion: I've never seen father so fearful... What could possibly have happened...
2312,Travant: General Hannibal! The rebels have seized control of Mease. Altena is en route to counter-attack. Your armored knights will join her at once!
2313,"Hannibal: Your Majesty, I've said it a thousand times and I'll say it again. There is no use fighting this war! We must arrange a truce with the liberators if we wish to recover the strength to endure! Bowing to the Empire was a despicable choice to start, one which now leaves us serving our citizens to the true enemy on a gilded platter!"
2314,"Travant: I did no ask for such dopey nonsense! The rebels have slaughtered my soldiers, and now they've stolen our territory! The hour is far too late for a truce!"
2315,Hannibal: I thought as much... Very well. I suppose I have no choice.
2316,"Travant: What's this, Hannibal? Do I hear traitorous rumblings coming from that mouth of yours?"
2317,"Hannibal: Come now, Your Majesty! Never would a warrior such as I consider turning my cloak. Traitor, indeed!"
2318,"Travant: Really, now? Then I trust you wouldn't object to a test of your warrior's loyalty. Until the war reaches its victorious end, Hannibal, I'll be taking care of your son."
2319,"Hannibal: I beg your pardon, Your Majesty? Do you have such little faith in me?!"
2320,"Travant: You have nothing to worry about, Hannibal. If you don't intend to betray me, then I don't intend to so much as scratch the boy."
2321,Hannibal: Why...
2322,Travant: Men! Bring me Hannibal's son!
2323,Coirpre: P-Papa...
2324,"Hannibal: Oh, Coirpre... I am so sorry..."
2325,"Travant: Remember, Hannibal. You have nothing to worry about, so long as you behave yourself. As soon as this war is won, you'll get him back. I don't get it, though. The boy isn't even your real son. How could he have such sway over you?"
2326,Hannibal: Coirpre has brought so much joy into my life. A true family transcends simple blood...
2327,"Travant: Ohoho! Could it be? Does Thracia's great statesman have a soft spot for children? Now, then. Thracia depends on you, Hannibal!"
2328,Travant: Disler! War is on our horizon. Defense of this castle is in your hands.
2329,"Disler: Oh, Your Majesty! To have your presence is a true honor and pleasure! Rest assured, milord. Luthecia is as an impregnable wall! I've seen to it myself."
2330,"Travant: I'll hold you to your word. Now, I've reason to doubt the loyalty of Hannibal at Kapathogia. I've taken his son hostage, just in case, and I'm leaving him to your custody."
2331,"Disler: Yes, sir! I'll not let him out of my sight. But should Hannibal turn his cloak-"
2332,Travant: Then you'll kill the son. Don't be lulled into offering even a child such as he any mercy.
2333,"Disler: Understood, milord."
2334,"Travant: Bishop Judah, we may be in need of reinforcements. How soon can I expect the Emperor to honor his end of the treaty?"
2335,"Judah: Heh... Even the great King Travant is wary of betrayal, is he? Be at peace. An Imperial unit is on the march to Thracia even as we speak."
2336,"Travant: Good. In that case, I think I'll leave the defense of Grutia to your hands. Try not to get too cocky with the rebels, Bishop. They're of a treacherous sort."
2337,"Lewyn: Looks like they're finally sending more dracoknights our way, Seliph. This must be it. It's time we readied everybody for battle."
2338,"Seliph: I don't know, Lewyn. Our foremost enemy is the Empire, is it not? Waging a war here feels... meaningless."
2339,"Lewyn: The point of a battle comes from how you conduct yourself in it, Seliph. And we hardly have much choice at this point! We're already this far into the fight..."
2340,Seliph: But what of that dracoknight who was watching us from the Manster peaks? I've seldom seen such a sad look in anybody's eyes... How could I fight somebody like her...?
2341,"Lewyn: That's enough, Seliph! This is a war! If you can't stand it any more, then go on! Run home to Tirnanog!"
2342,Seliph: Lewyn...
2343,"Oifey: I beg your pardon, Lord Lewyn?! His Majesty is tired and stressed. Such harsh words are uncalled for..."
2344,"Lewyn: Look, I know... But everyone is just as stressed as he is, yet they all know that we can't afford to stop. With the resurrection of Loptous lurking on the horizon, it's crucial we get to Grannvale and stop the world falling to ruin while we still can."
2345,"Seliph: Thank you, Oifey... but Lewyn speaks the truth. An inevitable battle lies ahead, and if we see in it naught by futility, then my duty is to carve my own purpose into it. Come, Oifey! Lewyn! I'll never again flinch or turn away!"
2346,"Leif: Is something wrong, Finn? You've been awfully quiet since we left Manster... I something on your mind?"
2347,Finn: Oh... Yes my lord. I don't suppose you saw a lone dracoknight lurking atop the mountains of Manster?
2348,"Leif: Oh, the woman? I saw her. I don't believe it's every day that you encounter a female dracoknight, is it? Was there something amiss about her?"
2349,"Finn: It was her weapon... She was wielding Gáe Bolg, Leonster's holy lance. And I sensed an aura cloaking her... The holy aura of Njörun, like your father."
2350,"Leif: What? What are you saying, Finn?!"
2351,"Finn: There is only one explanation, my lord. Your sister, Altena, mustn't have died in the Thracian ambush seventeen years ago. Nor must Gáe Bolg have been lost..."
2352,Leif: Altena?! She... She's still alive?! Then... Then what in the blazes was she doing commanding the Thracian army?
2353,"Finn: I'd surmise that Travant took her back to Thracia as a child, and raised her as his own."
2354,Leif: Huh... Who knew a man as cold as Travant could do something so humane?
2355,"Finn: It isn't so simple, my lord. Altena is the sole inheritor of your father's holy lineage from the earth goddess, Njörun. As such, unlike you, she alone is capable of wielding Gáe Bolg. Power is the only reason a man like Travant would ever be so kind to his enemy's child."
2356,"Leif: So he's tricked my sister just so he can use her like a... like a weapon! Travant... What a disgusting man... ...I want to help her, Finn. If we can tell her the truth, then I know we can work together to avenge our parents."
2357,"Finn: My lord, I believe you're the only one who could possibly convince her now. Even after all these years, my lord, you are still her brother. I'm certain she will open her heart to you if you try. Please, my lord. Please save Lady Altena..."
2358,"Hannibal: Hm... The rebels are on the move, are they?"
2359,Kanatz: Lord Hannibal! We're ready to attack at any moment. We await your command.
2360,Hannibal: Wait. For the time being we should remain on the defensive. I'd prefer to avoid any needless skirmishes with the enemy.
2361,"Kanatz: But sire, what about..."
2362,"Hannibal: ...My son? I know... I know, but... For now, I would rather hold back and let the battle unfold on its own first. My apologies, Kanatz, but I'd like you to take charge of defending the castle."
2363,"Kanatz: As you will, sire!"
2364,"Altena: All units, move in and engage the rebels! We will return Mease to Thracian control!"
2365,"Disler: What a sorry joke... Me, a distinguished general, stuck babysitting some brat?"
2366,"Coirpre: Excuse me, Mister Disler, but... Let me go! Papa doesn't want to fight. He's out there risking his life all because of me!"
2367,"Disler: Silence, boy! If Thracia's legendary Shield refuses to ply his warrior's craft of his own will, then we will force him to, by any means necessary!"
2368,"Coirpre: Oh, Papa... Sorry..."
2369,"Arion: Father, I've received grave news! It's Altena... She has fallen in battle."
2370,"Travant: I see... Very well, then. I suppose there's little choice now... I'm going to join the fray, Arion. You're in charge of defending the castle. I'll entrust this spear to you... And with it, the future of Thracia."
2371,"Arion: Hold on a moment, Father... This is Gungnir! What is the meaning of this? How do you intend to fight without it? Unless... Father, you can't be-"
2372,"Travant: I am. Frankly, Arion, I've had enough. Thracia is yours to do with as you see fit. But we don't need to be hated by their kind..."
2373,"Arion: Are you seriously suggesting I should seek a truce, Father? No! Never! To comply with the rebels now would be unthinkable!"
2374,"Travant: As I said, Thracia is yours. Do as you see fit. All I ask is for you to find a way to liberate Thracia's people from their suffering... Farewell, Areone."
2375,Arion: Father...
2376,"Hannibal: King Travant has joined the battle, has he? Hrm... I suppose I've no choice. My duty as a warrior demands it... Move in on the invaders! We'll let them proceed no further!"
2377,"Leif: Waaaaait! Please, my sister! Stop it!"
2378,"Altena: Your sister?! ...Who are you, and why do you think calling me your sister is a good idea?"
2379,"Leif: I... I am Leif, of House Leonster."
2380,"Altena: Leif? Oh, I see... The famous Prince Leif, is it? In case it wasn't obvious... And, evidently, it wasn't... I am Altena, daughter of Travant."
2381,"Leif: Listen to me, Altena! Your true parents are Quan and Ethlyn, whom Travant slew seventeen years ago. You vanished in Travant's attack, and so too did Gáe Bolg, the sacred earth lance of Leonster. Which, I might add, is the very lance resting in your hand as we speak! Only a true heir of House Leonster can wield Gáe Bolg."
2382,Altena: What are you talking about?! Are you seriously trying to claim my real father is my father's arch-enemy? That could never be... It mustn't...
2383,"Leif: Look into my eyes. If anything can prove the truth of my words to you, it will be my eyes. Please, sister..."
2384,"Altena: Fine... ...What is this?! I know you're lying, but I... I can't bring myself to doubt you anymore!"
2385,Leif: ...Altena!
2386,Altena: Wait! I... I must speak with Father. I need to confirm this...
2387,"Travant: Altena? Oh, you have got to be joking. Why? Why, why WHY did you abandon your post for the second time in as many days?"
2388,"Altena: My apologies, Father... but I have an urgent question to ask of you. Are you my father? Or was my father really King Quan?!"
2389,"Travant: Feh... I see you've found out at last. Well, I suppose it was only a matter of time before this day came. It's true. Quan did indeed sire you, but what difference does it make now? It doesn't change that it is I who raised you."
2390,"Altena: So you... You murdered my parents, Father..."
2391,"Travant: Heh heh... I suppose I did. Quan and Ethlyn died at my hand. Do you take issue with that? War is hell, Altena. War claims lives. Worrying now won't change a thing."
2392,"Altena: Gah... How dare you! How dare you mislead me all these years, Father! Er, no... Travant!"
2393,"Arion: That's enough, Altena!"
2394,"Altena: Get out of my way, Arion! This man dies here and now, and nobody can stop me! Not even you!"
2395,"Arion: I cannot allow this. If you dare to turn on Father, then you'll have to contend with me first!"
2396,"Altena: W-wait! I can't fight you, Arion! I could never-"
2397,"Arion: It's too late for you to stand down now... Farewell, Altena!"
2398,Altena: Nngh... Arion...
2399,"Travant: ...You didn't just kill her, did you, Arion? You know, you didn't need to go quite so far... Eh, no matter. I'm going to join the fray, Arion. I suppose there's little choice now... You're in charge of defending the castle."
2400,"Arion: Understood, Father."
2401,"Travant: I'll entrust this spear to you... and with it, the future of Thracia."
2402,"Arion: Hold on a moment, Father... This is Gungnir! What is the meaning of this? How do you intend to fight without it? Unless... Father, you can't be-"
2403,"Travant: I am. Frankly, Arion, I've had enough. Thracia is yours to do with as you see fit. But we don't need to be hated by their kind..."
2404,"Arion: Are you seriously suggesting I should seek a truce, Father? No! Never! To comply with the rebels now would be unthinkable!"
2405,"Travant: As I said, Thracia is yours. Do as you see fit. All I ask is for you to find a way to liberate Thracia's people from their suffering... Farewell, Arion."
2406,Arion: Father...
2407,"Hannibal: King Travant has joined the battle, has he? Hrm... I suppose I've no choice. My duty as a warrior demands it... Move in on the invaders! We'll let them proceed no further!"
2408,Arion: Altena! Are you alright?
2409,Altena: Nngh? ...Oh... Arion...
2410,"Arion: My apologies, Altena. I had to give Father a convincing show, that I might ensure your survival. I had no choice but to deal such a powerful blow."
2411,"Altena: Don't worry, Arion. I understand. But where is Fath... er, King Travant now?"
2412,Arion: You won't see him again... Father has died in battle.
2413,Altena: He has? ...How did it happen?
2414,Arion: You'd be better off not knowing. Father's heart was an enigma at the best of times...
2415,"Altena: ...Listen, Arion. What do you think I should do now?"
2416,"Arion: Join Prince Leif, your true brother. I'm certain he is still waiting for you."
2417,Altena: Then what will you-
2418,Arion: Altena... This is my fate. There's no helping it.
2419,"Altena: No! You can call for a truce, Arion! Now that Travant's dead, there's nothing at all to stop you from seeking peace! And I... I could never fight you!"
2420,"Arion: I wish I could, and I would were it not for Father's final words to me... Please, Altena... Go! However, be prepared. Our next meeting shall be on the battlefield, and I will not stay my hand!"
2421,Altena: Oh... Arion...
2422,"Altena: Pardon me, Lord Seliph. My name is Altena... Daughter of Quan of Leonster. My brother, Prince Leif, has explaned the truth to me, and I can no longer oppose you. If you please, I'd like to join your ranks."
2423,"Seliph: Princess Altena?! ...Ah, yes. That's right! Prince Leif has told me everything, and we've both prayed you would come... He'll be so glad to know you've joined us. You've made a difficult but wise decision."
2424,"Altena: ...I can still scarcely believe this has all happened. And yet, the moment I gazed into my brother's eyes, I understood everything. His eyes revealed my father's warm gaze... And as clear as if it were only yesterday, I felt for a split second as if I were a mere baby, once more swaddled in my mother's gentle arms..."
2425,Seliph: I admit I'm still not entirely sure what King Travant was trying to do with you. I still cannot see what would have led him to spare you and bring you home after murdering your parents...
2426,"Altena: I've heard he once told my brother, Arion, that he sought to use the might of Leonster's holy lance, Gáe Bolg, as his own. For that alone, he needed me..."
2427,Seliph: You were a little more than a tool to him?
2428,"Altena: I... I'm still not entirely sure. For all his cruelty, he still treated me as if I were his true daughter. He was still a father to me."
2429,"Seliph: Did he, now... I suppose I've never known much of his ways."
2430,"Altena: I must ask a favor of you, milord. It's about Arion... We need to help Prince Arion!"
2431,"Seliph: Certainly! I'm hardly eager to fight a man of his fine caliber, if what I've heard is true. The only question is, can we convince him?"
2432,"Altena: I'll do my best to persuade him again. All I ask is a little time: Please, milord!"
2433,"Lewyn: Bad news, Seliph. Looks like General Hannibal only opposed us because they're holding his son hostage. He never wanted to fight..."
2434,"Seliph: This cannot be... I've made a horrid mistake! Oh, General Hannibal... Please forgive me..."
2435,"Judah: The enemy has got their grubby paws on Kapathogia?! I should've known better than to trust those worthless Thracians... I suppose it was unavoidable... Fortify our defensive line. Until reinforcements arrive, we must defend the castle at all costs."
2436,"Musar: So this is the infamous Thracia... I've never seen such a bleak wasteland! Heh, no matter. The rebels' little rampage ends here. Ready, men? We're going in. The Emperor himself's put a handsome bounty on each rebel head. We mustn't waste a chance to claim it for ourselves!"
2437,"Lewyn: It looks like they've been holding a child in the dungeon, Seliph."
2438,Seliph: Who are you? What's the matter?
2439,"Coirpre: I'm Coirpre... I'm General Hannibal's son. And... Wait... Aren't you Lord Seliph, the liberator?!"
2440,"Seliph: Indeed I am. If I may ask, Coirpre, why would Thracia imprison one of their own general's sons?"
2441,"Coirpre: King Travant took me hostage. Papa didn't want to fight your army at all, sir! The king threatened my life to force Papa to fight... Please, sir... Please take me to Papa! If Papa knows I'm safe, then he won't have to keep fighting! Please! We've gotta save him!"
2442,"Seliph: I see... Don't worry. I promise we'll find him. Move out, everyone. I pray we'll still be in time to save General Hannibal!"
2443,"Lewyn: Bad news, Seliph. By the sound of it, they were holding General Hannibal's son hostage here."
2444,Seliph: Hannibal must have been forced to fight solely to protect his son! How appalling...
2445,"Lewyn: The son, Coirpre, seems to have vanished. He must've heard of his father's death. He probably couldn't stand to see any of us right now."
2446,Seliph: Blast...
2447,"Coirpre: Papa, stop! It's me! You don't have to fight now! The liberators have gone and captured Luthecia!"
2448,Hannibal: Coirpre?! You... You're safe!
2449,"Coirpre: Yep! Listen, Papa... I want to join Lord Seliph's army. Thracia's changed so much lately... I want to fight to help all its people, and bring back the old Thracia!"
2450,"Hannibal: You've grown into such a splendid young man, Coirpre... Very well! I, too, shall serve Lord Seliph."
2451,"Coirpre: Yes! Thank you, Papa! First we'll help free Thracia, and then together, we'll challenge the Empire!"
2452,"Judah: The enemy has got their grubby paws on Kapathogia?! I should've known better than to trust those worthless Thracians... I suppose it was unavoidable... Fortify our defensive line. Until reinforcements arrive, we must defend the castle at all costs."
2453,"Musar: So this is the infamous Thracia... I've never seen such a bleak wasteland! Heh, no matter. The rebels' little rampage ends here. Ready, men? We're going in. The Emperor himself's put a handsome bounty on each rebel head. We mustn't waste a chance to claim it for ourselves!"
2454,"Seliph: Lewyn, do you think Arion still intends to fight us?"
2455,"Lewyn: Looks like it. I've sent envoy after envoy offering a truce, but he's not responding. I guess his stubborn dracoknight pride compels him to fight to the bitter end. And here I was hoping the legendary Arion of Thracia'd be a wiser man than this... Seliph, I hope you understand we can't turn back now. This last battle needs to be fought."
2456,Seliph: I don't understand him... Why? Why must Arion insist on fighting such a futile battle...
2457,Seliph: Arion... How can he be so callous? Does he not understand the grief he is inflicting on Altena?!
2458,"Arion: The enemy has come as far as Grutia... Very well. All hands, deploy at once! Engage them in the Dragon Trinity Strike formation! This is our final chance. Thracia's destiny hangs in the balance of this final assault!"
2459,"Arion: They've come at last... Move out! Whether we win or die, we'll have fought in our fatherland's name! Dracoknights! Descend upon the enemy!"
2460,Julius: Arion. This place will not be your grave. I forbid it. Heh heh... Join me.
2461,"Seliph: Say, Lewyn... Did my eyes deceive me, or did Arion really vanish like that?"
2462,"Lewyn: Yeah, he did. Witnesses to the fight are saying Prince Julius appeared and took Arion."
2463,Seliph: The Emperor's son himself?
2464,"Lewyn: Mm... and your half-brother, at that..."
2465,Seliph: I can hardly believe we share a mother...
2466,"Lewyn: And yet you do. Empress Deirdre was a talented priestess, and it looks like he inherited her skill with white magic. For Prince Julius, common warping and healing spells are the merest of trifles. He doesn't even need staves! But that's not the whole story, Seliph. Prince Julius's true power comes from something else entirely..."
2467,Seliph: How do you mean?
2468,Lewyn: Loptous... It's the power of the dark lord...
2469,"Man: It wasn't all that long ago that the region here was under House Leonster's rule. Oh, what a peaceful time that was... As soon as the last war was over, though, the Thracians pounced on us like a starving cat..."
2470,"Old woman: King Travant's as heartless as men come, he is. But oddly enough, his two kids, Arion and Altena, are the kindest souls you'll ever meet. Like peas in a pod, those two are! Always have been. Oh, I pray nothing ever changes that..."
2471,"Woman: Thracia has many generals in its service, but Lord Hannibal is the most revered of 'em all. The man has devoted nigh on his entire life to the battlefield, so he never found a wife. Mind, twelve years ago or so, he did take in an orphan. He treats the boy as if he's his own flesh and blood. What a wonderful guy!"
2472,"Young man: General Disler of Luthecia's nothing more than a slimy toady to the king! Useless as he is, he still acts all like he's some almighty tyrant... What a foul little man."
2473,"Old man: They say a priest from a dark cult has got his foul hands on Grutia. Could it be true? Make no mistake. I know well the life King Travant is trying to crawl free of... But to allow a fell agent of the Loptyrian Order free run of his country... How could he make such a foolish choice? Accept this here barrier ring... And with it, please, save our beloved nation!"
2474,"Shannan: Wow, what a beauty..."
2475,Jeanne/Hermina: ...Excuse me?
2476,"Shannan: Oh, how rude of me! Y'see, I'm the prince of the great state of Isaach. Call me Shannan. And you're just too pretty, miss! I had to meet you, y'know? If I may be so bold, how'd you like to go get a nice, hot meal with me? I know the most charming little tavern..."
2477,Jeanne/Hermina: .....
2478,"Shannan: Something wrong, miss? Oh, I see! You're all nervous 'cause you stand before me, the great Prince Shannan, aren't you? Don't worry about it! How I look doesn't matter, 'cause to me, stayin' close witht the peasants is the most important thing there is."
2479,"Jeanne/Hermina: Huh... So you're... Alright, then. Show me Balmung! I've always wanted to see it for myself!"
2480,"Shannan: Huh? B-Balmung? Oh, yeah! The Balmung... Oh, er... Here you go! Look! It's the Balmung, the great dracoshield! How about that, huh? Now, where were we? Dinner, right?"
2481,"Jeanne/Hermina: Oh, you imbecile! Everybody knows that Balmung isn't a shield! You're nothing like the real Prince Shannan!"
2482,"???: Oh, geez... You're part of that liberation army, aren't you? Look, I'm real sorry! It's just... Women've been fawnin' over me left and right ever since I took to callin' myself Shannan. Here, take the bloody shield. Let's pretend this never happened, alright?"
2483,"Jeanne/Hermina: Honestly... What a pig! Oh, well. I guess this shield'll help me to toughen up a bit."
2484,Youth: Heh heh heh…
2485,Hawk: …?
2486,"Youth: Over at the public square, I just had a girl confess her love to me while sitting under a tree. Man, I wish I could share this feeling with ya!"
2487,Hawk: …
2488,"Youth: Of course! You’re with the liberation army! Here, I have some medicine and also the village’s secret text for ya."
2489,"Hawk: Er, thanks."
2490,Youth: Love sure is a beautiful thing. Now get out there and find yourself a woman!
2491,Hannibal: Charlot…
2492,Charlot: Father? What’s the matter?
2493,"Hannibal: Son, I feel terrible for what I’ve put you through. You may have been better off being raised in a normal home than by a soldier like me."
2494,Charlot: Father! What’re you saying!? You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to be with. And now I can work to help bring about peace. That makes me so happy.
2495,Hannibal: Is that so?
2496,Charlot: And that’s not all.
2497,Hannibal: Yes?
2498,"Charlot: I’m proud of you, father. The citizens of Kapathogia admire you greatly, and you raised me after all."
2499,"Hannibal: That’s very kind of you to say, Charlot. You’ve turned into a fine young man indeed. Oh yes, I almost forgot. This staff was found lying in the castle. I believe you can use it."
2500,"Charlot: Wow, that’s a nice staff. Thanks, father."
2501,Febail: Patty! Are you stealing again!?
2502,"Patty: Yeah, just a little."
2503,"Febail: Well, knock it off! I don’t care if it is coming from the enemy."
2504,Patty: You think I like doin’ this!? Do you have any idea just how low our army’s food supply is? That takes money!
2505,"Febail: Yeah, well, I caught a guy making fun of you. He said ‘It’s no wonder you became a thief with a pirate for a mum’. Of course, I floored the guy for saying that."
2506,"Patty: Let ‘em say whatever they want, Febail. It doesn’t bother me. ‘Cause now we know our mother was a warrior… and of Crusader Ulir descent to boot! I was so happy I started cryin’ when Lewyn told me that…"
2507,"Febail: Yeah, me too. With all we’ve gone through… growing up as orphans and all… I never would’ve dreamed our mother was of noble rank. Do you remember her at all?"
2508,"Patty: Nope, not one bit. How about you?"
2509,Febail: Just a little… just that she was beautiful and very kind.
2510,"Patty: …So she’s dead, then?"
2511,Febail: I don’t know… But you and I are going to look for her when we’re all done here. …And then we can finally find out who our father is.
2512,Asaello: Daisy! Hey! DAISY! Don't tell me you've been stealing again!
2513,"Daisy: Oh, er... Yep. Just a bit, though!"
2514,"Asaello: Ugh. Look, I don't care if you're just stealing from the enemy. I don't like you stealing at all! Knock it off, okay?"
2515,"Daisy: What, d'you think I like doing this? That I'm stealing for the fun of it?! This army needs to eat, y'know, and we need gold for that! We don't exactly have many options here!"
2516,Asaello: But-
2517,"Daisy: And what about the kids back in Conote, huh? They need money to get by as well, and I can't just leave them to starve!"
2518,"Asaello: Yeah, I guess you're right... I hope they're doing okay."
2519,"Daisy: Don't act like you don't have to help too, Asaello! You're sitting on a tidy little fortune from arena prizes. You'd better not waste it!"
2520,"Asaello: Gah, I knew that'd come back to bite me..."
2521,"Patty: Hmph... So you're that Coirpre guy? Here I thought the son of the great General Hannibal'd be this amazingly hot guy, but you're just some snotty kid..."
2522,"Coirpre: You're not any better yourself, you know."
2523,"Patty: Oh, excuse you! Are you really trying to say I just look like a child?"
2524,"Coirpre: Yeah. I really am, because you really do."
2525,Patty: Nrrrgh... Y-you little... You JERK!
2526,"Seliph: General Hannibal, it is an honor to meet you at last. Please accept my apologies for engaging you in such a pointless battle."
2527,"Hannibal: Lord Seliph... it is I who need apologize, not you. You have my deepest gratitude for all you've done to rescue my son..."
2528,"Seliph: Your reputation precedes you, General. We've all heard of Thracia great Shield. That a warrior of your caliber was coerced onto the battlefield by use of hostages... King Travant is an utterly sickening man!"
2529,"Hannibal: Indeed... And a pitiful man, at that. All he has accomplished is shattering any trust his subjects once held in him. The people's hearts can only endure so much abuse before they break..."
2530,"Seliph: If I may, General, would you join us? To have the power and wisdom of a great general like you would be the finest boon."
2531,"Hannibal: Very well! If you have a use even for these old bones, Lord Seliph, then you have my fealty."
2532,"Lene: You're Coirpre, right?"
2533,"Coirpre: Oh, y-yes... I am."
2534,"Lene: I hear you're an orphan too, right? D'you remember anything at all from being a kid?"
2535,"Coirpre: No, sorry. Nothing at all. I think I was still just a baby when Papa came to Darna and took me in..."
2536,"Lene: Wait, you're from Darna, too?!"
2537,"Coirpre: Are you familiar with Darna, Lene?"
2538,"Lene: Yep. I grew up in the Darna abbey. They told me my mom, who I think was a dancer as well, left me there when I was just about two years old. And that's why I'm a dancer now. See, what I was thinking was that maybe, if I did the same thing as her, one day I might find my mom again. It's a bit embarrassing, but I taught myself everything I know about dancing."
2539,"Coirpre: Huh. That's really great of you, Lene! I, er, guess I thought wrong about you..."
2540,"Lene: Not a big fan of dancers, Coirpre?"
2541,"Coirpre: Not really, no... At least, I wasn't until I met you, Lene."
2542,"Lene: Aww! Thanks, Coirpre!"
2543,"Laylea: Hey, you’re Charlot, aren’t you?"
2544,Charlot: Huh… Have we met?
2545,"Laylea: I’m Laylea. You’ve never seen a dancer before, have you?"
2546,Charlot: No… you’re my first.
2547,"Laylea: Haha! Well, if you ever have some free time, come on over and I’ll dance for you."
2548,Charlot: Oh… okay.
2549,"Julia: Are you at all hurt, Lord Seliph?"
2550,"Seliph: Ah, Julia! No, I'm fine, thank you. I pray you're taking care of yourself."
2551,Julia: Lord Seliph...
2552,Seliph: Is something amiss?
2553,"Julia: Er... No, it's nothing..."
2554,"Seliph: Listen, Julia. You've been acting oddly all day. Is something troubling you?"
2555,"Julia: I... All I can feel is dread... I feel as if I'll be torn from you, and we'll never see each other again... I... I'm terrified..."
2556,"Seliph: You've no need to worry, Julia. I swore to you all those months ago that I'll protect you, no matter what. Have faith, Julia. I'll never let you down."
2557,"Julia: I know... I do believe in you... I'm so sorry, Lord Seliph... I've never been more than a nuisance to you."
2558,"Seliph: You must be weary. We have been on the march for weeks on end, after all! Listen. Once we're done here, we'll be headed for the free city of Miletos. You can have a nice, long rest there. Oh, that's right! Miletos is famous for its merchants, no? I can take you shopping while we're there. I'll buy you anything you desire. Well, so long as it's not too pricey. Heh... I can only imagine how poorly Lewyn would handle any over-spending!"
2559,"Julia: You would do that...? Oh, thank you, Lord Seliph... Thank you..."
2560,"Seliph: Is that a little smile I see before me? Heh, now that's more like it!"
2561,"Julia: Lord Seliph... Close your eyes, please."
2562,Seliph: Hm? Why do you ask?
2563,Julia: I wish to cast a Ward spell upon you... It will help you better resist enemy magic.
2564,"Seliph: Are you sure, Julia?! Wouldn't the use of such a spell endanger you?"
2565,Julia: Everything will be alright... I've done naught but take and take so far. All I want is to give something back.
2566,Seliph: Julia...
2567,"Julia: Oh, lords in the heavens above... I implore you, confer your blessings upon Lord Seliph..."
2568,"Finn: Pardon me, my lady... I am Finn, a knight of House Leonster. It is an honor to meet you once more."
2569,"Altena: So you're Sir Finn, then? Leif's told me about you already. I can't thank you enough for all you've done to protect him all these years."
2570,"Finn: Thank you, my lady, but it is I who owes you an apology. Not once in the past seventeen years did I ever suspect that you yet lived on, let alone just across the border! My failure to search for you is... is inexcusable..."
2571,Altena: Sir Finn... Are those tears I see? Why... Why are you crying?
2572,"Finn: I... My apologies, my lady. You shouldn't have to see me in such a state as this..."
2573,"Altena: Hold a moment... I remember something... Yes, I... I was incredibly fond of you... And I always sought your attention, didn't I? That's right... Sir Finn..."
2574,"Finn: My lady, I..."
2575,Hannibal: Princess Altena. I've been filled in on your situation. You have my deepest condolences.
2576,"Altena: General Hannibal... You've chosen to ally with Lord Seliph as well, have you? Thank goodness... I was dreading the very idea of considering you an enemy as well."
2577,"Hannibal: Hm. Pray tell, milady, what has become of Prince Arion?"
2578,"Altena: My broth- Er, no... Arion simply refused to listen to anything I said. Perhaps you would have better luck persuading him, sir?"
2579,"Hannibal: If you couldn't convince him, milady, then nothing has a chance. I would surmise that Prince Arion is resolving to die a warrior's death, not giving in to the indignity of a truce. We've no choice left."
2580,Altena: But sir-
2581,"Hannibal: I know how you feel, milady... But some men like Arion are stubborner than mules. Most likely, Prince Arion would never wish to reveal such perceived weakness before you. Please understand this at least, milady..."

2583,"With Thracia's downfall, Seliph sets his sights on his final destination: Grannvale. His route to the Empire takes him through the Miletos District, a collective of free cities which was once a vibrant and wealthy hub of commerce for all of Jugdral. Now, though, only a dying land choked by the Empire and Loptyrian Cult lies before Seliph. At Chronos Castle, the seemingly mad rule of Queen Hilda has condemned countless citizens to savage, merciless deaths. And in the Rados region, Bishop Morigan, under the command of Archbishop Manfroy, conducts child hunt after child hunt. Wealth. Liberty. Hope. Even life itself... All crumbled through the people's fingers. As the evil cult plies its sacrificial rituals and pile the bodies of their victims even higher, Seliph knows he cannot leave Miletos be. Greeted by raucous cheers from the people, the liberation army routed the Empire's men, freeing the city of Peruluke. The hope of Miletos had slowly been rotting away in the Empire's hands, but at long last, the arrival of Seliph and his liberation army breathes new life into the nation's future.

2584,"Febail:
“Hey, you’re pretty tough for such a small thing. You’re not scared being out here?”
"
2585,"Lana:
“Well, I’d be lying to say I wasn’t. But when I think of those poor children…”
"
2586,"Febail:
“You like kids, huh?”
"
2587,"Lana:
“Yeah, I really do. You were taking care of orphans before, weren’t you? That’s so wonderful, Febail.”
"
2588,"Febail:
“Yeah, well that was Patty‘s idea, not mine. I’m really not all that big on kids, you see.”
"
2589,"Lana:
“Hah… I know better than that. I saw all those crying children clinging to you when we were leaving the Manster District. You’re like a father to them, you know.”
"
2590,"Febail:
“S, stop it, would you? I just… Look, I gotta get going. I’ll see you around.”
"
2591,"Lana:
“Haha… You’re a good guy, Febail.”
"
2592,"Seliph:
“Lene, Lewyn wants a word with you. I’ll be right over here if you need anything.”
"
2593,"Lewyn:
“Lene, take it easy out here. You’d send the boys crying if you ever scratched that beautiful face of yours.”
"
2594,"Lene:
“Hey, Lewyn. Did you know my mum?”
"
2595,"Lewyn:
“Huh? Why would I know your mum?”
"
2596,"Lene:
‘Cause you seem to know everything.
"
2597,"Lewyn:
“You want to know about your mum, huh…”
"
2598,"Lene:
“Yes! And my dad too!”
"
2599,"Lewyn:
“Lene, you are who you are… Don’t worry yourself too much about who your parents were. I will tell you this, though. Your parents loved each other like nothing else. They parted during a very rough time, but they still look over you, Lene. Trust me, they do.”
"
2600,"Lene:
“Yeah… Ever since I was little I felt as if someone was watching out for me. That was my father, wasn’t it… Why won’t he show himself to me!? It’s lonely not knowing who your parents are your whole life…”
"
2601,"Lewyn:
“Lene…”
"
2602,"=== Seliph:
“Tine, Lewyn wants a word with you. I’ll be right over here if you need anything.” ===
Lewyn:
“Tine, Hilda was your aunt, wasn’t she? It must be tough being out here.”
"
2603,"Tine:
“No, I’m fine with it. Queen Hilda was an evil, evil person.”
"
2604,"Lewyn:
“What, did she treat you bad or something?”
"
2605,"Tine:
“Yeah. She always used to beat me and call me names, and she said my mother a traitor.”
"
2606,"Lewyn:
“That would’ve been Tailtiu…”
"
2607,"Tine:
“Yes. She and Arthur escaped to Silesse after the Battle of Belhalla. Then she had me. But I was told my father passed away…”
"
2608,"Lewyn:
“Is that right… So you came to the Alster Kingdom after all that?”
"
2609,"Tine:
“Well, we didn’t go there willingly. We were taken by force by King Bloom’s men. And then that’s where my mother died.”
"
2610,"Lewyn:
“You sure haven’t had it easy, have you…”
"
2611,"Tine:
“Yeah… Anyway, Hilda really had it in for my mum. My mum put up with so much to keep me safe. A day didn’t go by that she wasn’t crying…”
"
2612,"Lewyn:
“Geez… That’s horrible.”
"
2613,"Tine:
“Lewyn… are you okay?”
"
2614,"Lewyn:
“Huh? Why do you ask?”
"
2615,"Tine:
“I don’t know. It kinda looks like you’re crying.”
"
2616,"Lewyn:
“No, I’m… it’s… it must just be sweat. It’s nothing…”
"
2617,"Julius: Ishtar, what's the status here?"
2618,"Ishtar: Everything is moving smoothly according to your plan, Lord Julius."
2619,Julius: Heh... I wonder what it must be like to be as terrified of our sacrifices to the dark lord as the peasants must be.
2620,Ishtar: I've seen it myself. Knowing their children are doomed to the stake nigh drives them mad with grief... Particularly the mothers...
2621,Julius: Hmhmhm... Magnificent. Let them learn now the true meaning of despair. Let their will to live erode and crumble. Let them become little more than ragdolls. Let them become the ideal slaves for the rise of the Loptous Empire.
2622,"Ishtar: Also, it seems we've captured far too many children. This castle simply doesn't have the room for them all. How shall I handle this?"
2623,"Julius: Send them to Belhalla at once. I will groom them personally, I think. Friends, family... it matters not. By the end they will despise each other, ready to kill their own in power's name. Only the fittest will survive, and these fittest will become the ideal citizens of Loptous's new world."
2624,Ishtar: But Lord Julius... What of your father? What of Emperor Arvis? The emperor refuses to allow any child hunts under his watch.
2625,"Julius: My father? Heh... My father is not worth fretting over, Ishtar. I will persuade him easily..."
2626,Ishtar: Lord Julius...
2627,Hilda: Ishtar! Where is His Highness?
2628,"Ishtar: Oh, Mother... The prince just departed for Belhalla."
2629,"Hilda: He did, did he? ...You know, Ishtar, I daresay the prince has quite the love for you. Hell, I'm already hearing the wedding bells ring!"
2630,Ishtar: I... I don't-
2631,"Hilda: Open your ears, Ishtar! Friege is by far the most esteemed of Grannvale's noble houses, and I, like the Emperor himself, am of House Velthomer. There is nobody in this land who could ever be worthier to the prince's hand than you!"
2632,Ishtar: A-as you say...
2633,"Hilda: Now, then! We have more pressing matters ahead. Those rebels, murderers of my dear husband and son, are coming our way, Ishtar! Not only that, they dared to steal Alster from us! Never has history given Friege a more dire enemy than Seliph, his father and all of his kin! I shall await them here at Chronos, that I may give them the welcome they deserve. You run along to Miletos. After all, those brats won't arrange their own journey to Belhalla!"
2634,"Ishtar: Yes, Mother..."
2635,"Dark mage: Your Majesty, the mages are in position. However, er... we have a slight problem. A small few children escaped our hold amidst the cover of confusion from our deployment. What are your orders?"
2636,Hilda: Excuse me?! How dare anyone under my command be so incompetent... No matter. Kill them all. Teach them all a lesson. Relay this command to General Ridale at Rados. He is to put them all down at once.
2637,Girl: Er... Where do we run now?
2638,"Boy: Sorry, I dunno."
2639,Girl: But... But if we get...
2640,Boy: Don't cry! It... It'll all be fine! Don't ya know? The crusaders are coming! They'll save us all. I know it!
2641,Girl: Sniff... I guess you're right. The crusaders'll come. They will... They will...
2642,"Morigan: Ah, General Ridale. We've got orders for you from Queen Hilda. She wants you to move out at once."
2643,"Ridale: Excellent. It's high time that we had work which better befits knights. I am absolutely fed up with hunting children! I swear, if I have to hunt even one more child..."
2644,"Morigan: Oh, what a pity that is. You see, we've a handful of escaped brats who are all in sore need of an execution."
2645,"Ridale: Oh, for the love of..."
2646,"Morigan: What's this? Are you, a loyal Imperial general, dissatisfied with your orders? Do I smell a filthy traitor to the trust of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Arvis?"
2647,"Ridale: ...No, sir. I could... I could never consider betraying His Majesty... Very well. I suppose I have no choice..."
2648,Morigan: Hmph... Honor of a knight? How quaint.
2649,"Manfroy: Princess Julia. At last, I've found you..."
2650,Julia: Huh? Who are you?
2651,"Manfroy: Heh... The shock stripped you of your memory all those years ago, did it? Perfect. Now, come!"
2652,Julia: N-no! Take your hands off me!
2653,"Manfroy: Heh heh... You cannot resist fate, my dear. Now, cease your struggle and come along..."
2654,Julia: No! Ahh... Lord Seliph... Help... me...
2655,"Lewyn: Seliph, I'm hearing that a couple of children have just fled Chronos. Unless we step in now, they're sure to meet a gristly end."
2656,Seliph: Children?! Very well. We'll move out at once. I won't rest until every last one is safe.
2657,"Lewyn: We've got another problem, too. It's Julia... She's gone. I've searched high and low, but she's nowhere in sight."
2658,"Seliph: No! Oh, no... How could this be..."
2659,"Lewyn: I can't believe it, either, but that's how it is... My guess is the enemy seized her. But why... Why would they only target Julia? This doesn't make any sense..."
2660,"Seliph: Gah... Hold on, Julia, wherever you are... No matter what happens, we'll find you!"
2661,"Ridale: Well, we've no need to make haste here. Men, move out... but at a leisurely pace."
2662,Girl: You're the liberation army? Wow... You're all amazing!
2663,"Boy: Whoa, the liberators! You're the best!"
2664,"Boy: Wait, you're a crusader? Really? Huh..."
2665,Girl: Ohh! You're a crusader... I was really scared there...
2666,Boy: Huh? You're with the liberators?! Wow! You came for us after all!
2667,Girl: Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!
2668,"Seliph: Any luck finding the children, Lewyn?"
2669,"Lewyn: Nope, no luck. Looks like they've already been sent to Miletos. Let's move! There's no time to lose while they're still in danger. But it looks like we'll need to capture Rados as well, if we're going to get the gates to Miletos open."
2670,"Seliph: Understood. Castle Rados is our next challenge, then!"
2671,"Seliph: Any luck finding the children, Lewyn?"
2672,"Lewyn: Nope, no luck. Looks like they've already been sent to Miletos. Let's move! There's no time to lose while they're still in danger."
2673,Seliph: This is... It's like a ghost town...
2674,"Lewyn: The handiwork of Morigan's mages, I hear. Any who dared to resist met a grisly end..."
2675,Seliph: How could they... How could anyone be so savage...
2676,"Lewyn: And that's why we've got to fight this war to the end, Seliph. This is something you've got to understand. This is the way of the Loptyrian Empire. They have no place at all for the good-hearted..."
2677,"Lewyn: Now, it shouldn't be too long before the gate through to Miletos opens for us. What's your next move, Seliph?"
2678,"Seliph: Needless to say, we must march on Miletos. We can't afford to rest while those children are still at risk... Or Julia for that matter."
2679,"Lewyn: Good. And after that, Grannvale awaits!"
2680,"Arvis: It has been a long time, Ishtar. How fare you of late?"
2681,"Ishtar: Oh, Your Majesty! What brings you here?"
2682,"Arvis: Listen, Ishtar. Release the captive children. I know you care no more for these foul deeds than I do."
2683,"Ishtar: My apologies, sir, but I'm on Prince Julius's-"
2684,Arvis: Pay Julius's orders no mind. I'll be having a word with him soon.
2685,Ishtar: But...
2686,"Arvis: This is an order from your emperor, Ishtar! Has Julius bent you such that you will no longer listen to the word of your liege?"
2687,"Ishtar: No... Never, Your Highness..."
2688,"Julius: I think not, Father. Ishtar is mine. Your selfish ways are so bothersome."
2689,Arvis: Julius! How dare you-
2690,"Julius: Why, Father, it almost sounds as if you still don't know any better! Old age must already be dulling that once brilliant mind of yours. Why not retire before it grows still feebler? Unless... Ohoho! Don't tell me you still seriously believe that you can banish me?"
2691,Arvis: No... I know better than to try something so futile again... I... I have no further objection.
2692,"Julius: That's better. Now, then. Begone! Return to your post and haunt my sight no more. Defending Chalphy is crucial. Don't fail me for once in your sorry life, Father."
2693,"Arvis: Y-yes, Julius. At once..."
2694,"Manfroy: Hmhmhm... How the mighty have fallen! Never would you think this wretch, now clinging only to the ghost of a crown, was once the most powerful man in Jugdral."
2695,"Julius: Ah, Manfroy. Where's Julia? Have you restored her memory yet?"
2696,"Manfroy: Your dear little sister is in Chalphy, burdened once more by her old memories. Never have I seen such horror as when she recalled how you, her brother, almost killed her! Or how her dearly departed mother spirited her clear of the castle and your clutches..."
2697,"Julius: Indeed... Near everyone puts up some defiance to death by my hand, yet Deirdre never so much as flinched in the end. She accepted her own demise, all to save Julia with what little strength she still had... Julia possesses the foul powers of that ghoul, Naga, just as Deirdre once did. Nothing is more crucial than killing her now, Manfroy, lest we lose the chance."
2698,"Manfroy: You overestimate her threat, milord. After all, the Book of Naga remains under the strictest lock and key in Belhalla. Without it, I cannot fathom how Naga's soul could ever come to dwell within that girl..."
2699,"Julius: How many times must I explain, Manfroy? Every last one of the avatars of Naga, the heirs of Heim, must be purged from existence!"
2700,"Manfroy: Understood, milord. I'll have my men see to it that Julia is dead by sundown."
2701,"Julius: Do not fail me Manfroy. Now, then. I suppose I'm needed in the capital. I shall ensure that holding the Miletos territory is the Order's highest priority."
2702,"Manfroy: Before the week is done, Your Majesty, the corpse of Seliph will lie before you."
2703,"Julius: Seliph? ...Ah, of course. The one the peasants call the ""scion of light""... Feh, just as they call me the ""scion of darkness"". The alleged eldest son of Deirdre, and the alleged true heir of Grannvale... A fairy tale, told to inspire hope amongst fools!"
2704,"Manfroy: He poses a threat to us nonetheless, milord. The sooner we dispose of him, the better."
2705,"Julius: Surely he doesn't truly bear the power of the crusader Baldr... He couldn't possibly... I might not care about him, Manfroy, but you're welcome to do with him as you will."
2706,"Manfroy: Very good, milord..."
2707,Ishtar: Lord Julius...
2708,"Julius: Ishtar. Shall we be off, then? I've tasked the Order to defend Miletos. Say... I have a better idea. I want to play a game. Rumor has it that a small army of fresh sacrificial meat is headed our way. Let's see who can claim the life of a rebel first."
2709,"Ishtar: Yes, Lord Julius. I'd love to!"
2710,"Julius: Heh... Such an easy win, Ishtar."
2711,"Ishtar: Masterfully done, Lord Julius! I expected no less of you."
2712,Julius: I grow weary of this silly game.
2713,"Ishtar: Heh! That's the end of it, Lord Julius. I've won."
2714,"Julius: Hrm... Not bad at all, Ishtar."
2715,Ishtar: Nng! Why...
2716,"Julius: You've lost, have you? Hmph... We leave at once!"
2717,"Lewyn: Looks like we're too late, Seliph. The kids are already gone. I'm guessing they're well on their way to Grannvale."
2718,Seliph: Blast... Not again...
2719,"Lewyn: I hate to admit it, but I doubt we could've gotten here soon enough either way. Now, then. It sounds like they're just finishing up repairs on the Miletos Strait bridge. Ready to move in on Chalphy?"
2720,Seliph: Chalphy... My father's homeland...
2721,Lewyn: So it is. I'm betting the citizens there will be even happier to see you than usual. Let's not let them wait any longer!
2722,"Seliph: Indeed! Everyone, move out. Onward to Chalphy!"
2723,"Arvis: Ah, Bishop Palmark... Your Grace, I need you to escort these children to safety."
2724,Palmark: Come again?! Are you setting them free?
2725,"Arvis: Indeed. More of Julius' minions from Belhalla will be here at any moment. You need to move, and quickly!"
2726,"Palmark: Y-yes, of course! Thank you, Your Majesty... Thank you so much..."
2727,Arvis: I... I also wish to entrust you with this.
2728,Palmark: Hold on a moment... Isn't this-
2729,"Arvis: Once, long ago, you were a confidante to Sigurd, were you not? ...You already know what you must do."
2730,"Palmark: Y-yes, sire..."
2731,Arvis: Now go! Protect the children with your life!
2732,Julia: Father...
2733,"Arvis: Julia, I... I beg your forgiveness. For all the misery I've wrought, you must hate me so..."
2734,"Julia: That's not true! It doesn't matter what happened, Father. Not even for a moment have I hated you! To me, you've always been one of the kindest men I've ever known!"
2735,"Arvis: No... I am a fool. I've been a fool from the outset. All this time, I've been Manfroy's puppet. When I finally saw the strings he was pulling, it was too late. I was powerless to do a thing. I had already given the Empire to Julius... The embodiment of Loptous, the dark god. He... He took the love of my life from me... And you are next..."
2736,"Julia: Mother sacrificed herself for me... She gave the last of her strength to ensure I made it as far away from Julius as possible. I think the trauma must have wiped my memory... And if Lewyn hadn't found me... But just knowing that Julius did that to his own mother... Now I remember, I almost wish I didn't... It hurts so much..."
2737,"Arvis: Oh, Julia... We have so much more to talk about. I wish we could, but time is short. You are in grave danger so long as you stay here. Run. Run with Bishop Palmark. Please..."
2738,"Manfroy: Tsk tsk... I think not, Arvis. The only place Lady Julia is going is back with me to Velthomer. Now, I do believe His Imperial Majesty should keep to Prince Julius' orders. That is, unless you want your dear daughter to meet the axe."
2739,"Arvis: How dare you, Manfroy! You address your emperor! How dare you seek to use my daughter as a common bargaining chip!"
2740,"Manfroy: Hmhmhm... So you still feebly cling to your titles and thrones, do you? Your time has long passed, Arvis. You, and this world, now belong to Prince Julius. Unless you wish to know pain beyond the ken of mortal men, still your tongue and obey your new liege without question. It is almost a pity your heroics are for naught. Every last child you freed shall be a festering corpse before this day is done! Hee hee hee..."
2741,Julia: F-Father!!
2742,Arvis: Julia... I am so sorry... Julius' thugs are too powerful. I cannot protect you... All I can do now is give you this... This circlet once belonged to Deirdre. This... Only it could possibly save you n-
2743,"Manfroy: Enough! We leave at once, Julia!"
2744,Julia: Father! Oh...
2745,"Palmark: Come along, children! Hurry!"
2746,"Girl: But there's nowhere for us to go, sir..."
2747,"Boy: The dark priests are right behind us! We're gonna die, aren't we?"
2748,"Palmark: Be at peace. All will be well. Lord Seliph will be here at any moment to rescue us. Have faith in the crusaders, my children!"
2749,"Seliph: Are you unharmed, Your Grace?"
2750,"Palmark: Lord Seliph! Ohh, bless you! We've awaited you for so long. I've done all I can to survive, all to ensure you receive your birthright. Here... Take it, milord."
2751,Seliph: W... what is this?
2752,Palmark: It is the sacred relic of House Chalphy. The divine blade... Tyrfing.
2753,"Seliph: But... How could you have it, Your Grace?"
2754,"Palmark: My apologies, milord, but I cannot say. I swore an oath..."
2755,"Seliph: I see... Fair enough, then. I couldn't possibly thank you enough, Your Grace. So this is Tyrfing, then... I've never felt power quite like this..."
2756,"Palmark: Milord, I beg of you... Please, retake Chalphy at once! Your subjects have endured for so long, in hope of one day seeing your return..."
2757,"Seliph: Rest easy now, Your Grace. So long as I have Tyrfing in hand, we have nothing more to fear!"
2758,"Lewyn: A job well done indeed, Seliph. And would you just look at that! The locals are so happy to see you. Look! They're already pouring into the streets to rejoice at your return."
2759,"Seliph: Mm. I'm home. At long last, I'm home... Nothing has ever felt this good. But... I mustn't celebrate just yet..."
2760,"Lewyn: Julia, right? You must be worried something fierce. Heh... Got a little thing for her, do you?"
2761,"Seliph: Oh! Er... No, nothing of the sort..."
2762,"Lewyn: I've had a word with some locals who've seen her. Archbishop Manfroy's got his grubby hands on her, by the sound of it. It's a pretty safe bet that Julia's still somewhere in Grannvale."
2763,"Seliph: Say, Lewyn... Something feels amiss. We've defeated Arvis and avenged my father, and yet I still feel... Empty."
2764,"Lewyn: That'd be because we still have a while to go until we reach the end of all this. If anything, the real battle here's only just about to get started. Trust me. By the time this holy war has come to a close, Seliph, the truth behind it all will be clear as day."
2765,"Woman: Ohh! Oh, noble crusader! We beg of you, save our children! The children... the dark priests want to sacrifice them to their god!"
2766,"Man: Few folk livin' today are as vile as that Queen Hilda of Chronos. She's real cozy with them dark cultists. She goes 'round stealin' kids, then if they so much as cry, she kill the mams so calm-like, you'd think she was just swattin' flies! There's no way that woman's human! It's a fiend that's rulin' us now..."
2767,"Old man: Long ago, the Twelve Crusaders waged holy war against the Loptous Empire for fifteen years. Nary a single corner of the land of Jugdral escaped the war's clutches. It was Saint Heim who smote the dark god's avatar, Emperor Galle XVII, restoring light to this land at long last. And yet... the dark god is upon us once more. Oh, great crusaders, protect us all!"
2768,"Man: 'Tis only been lately that we've had t'deal with these rites of sacrifice. Not so long ago, from what I hear, Emperor Arvis himself forbade 'em entirely. What the devil could've changed his mind? Please, I'm beggin' you! You've gotta save our children! Here, this Magic Ring oughta help you out."
2769,"Young woman: A terrifying man, that Prince Julius is... Just a single glance into those eyes of his and you're gone... You lose yourself. So many of my friends and others my age've all left for Belhalla to serve him. I've heard nothing from any of 'em since..."
2770,"Old man: None of yeh come even close t'being strong enough t'fight Prince Julius. Hate t'say it, but sometimes, yeh need t'make sacrifices if yeh wanna keep goin'..."
2771,"???: Seliph... Oh, Seliph..."
2772,Seliph: I-is somebody there?
2773,"???: Oh, Seliph... How you've grown..."
2774,Seliph: Could it be... M-Mother?! Mother! Is it truly you?
2775,"Deirdre: What a fine young man you've become... Bless Lewyn for all he's done to guide you this far... ...Seliph, never forget. Your friends... Your companions... You must always cherish them... You owe them so..."
2776,"Seliph: ...Y-yes, Mother. I understand. Oh! I've defeated Emperor Arvis! At long last, Father has been avenged!"
2777,Deirdre: You did... But what of Julius and Julia...?
2778,"Seliph: I still don't know... Wait! Mother, how could you know of what happened to them?"
2779,Deirdre: ...
2780,Seliph: ...Mother?
2781,Sigurd: Seliph.
2782,"Seliph: Who's there? Wait... Is... Is it you, Father?!"
2783,"Sigurd: Listen, Seliph. You must stay humble, no matter what. Remember, your power alone was not what put an end to Arvis..."
2784,"Seliph: What? How do you mean, Father?"
2785,"Sigurd: You must learn the sorrow of the common man, Seliph, Your truth is not the reality of all. Unless you know their pain, these long years of war will have been for naught..."
2786,Seliph: F-Father! Come back... Please!
2787,"Deirdre: Seliph... Take care, my son..."
2788,Seliph: Oh... Mother...
2789,"Lester: Hey! Hey, Patty! Looking good as ever, I see."
2790,"Patty: Oh. It's you, Lester. Look, just go away, okay?"
2791,"Lester: Oh, come on! You're always so harsh and mouthy. What gives?"
2792,Patty: You're one to talk! You've never said anything that isn't teasing me in the most mind-numbing ways imaginable!
2793,"Lester: Wait, I haven't?"
2794,Patty: Of course you haven't! How can't you see that? You don't treat any other girls like this!
2795,"Lester: Hang on! What do you mean you're a girl, Patty?"
2796,Patty: Oh! You... You twit!
2797,"Lester: Hey, I was joking! I'm sorry... C'mon, calm down, okay? Look, I guess I kinda care about you. That sort of turned into... Er, sorry."
2798,Patty: Care about me? What's that supposed to mean?!
2799,"Lester: It means that I sort of like you, okay! You can't be that thick, can you?"
2800,"Nanna: Say, Lord Leif... All my life I've been hearing how Miletos' cities are so fabulously rich. But look at it now... Look at all these ruins..."
2801,"Leif: Mm... No matter how awful the Empire is, I never thought them to be quite so brutal. To think, just two decades ago one could buy almost anything one could ever desire from this region's many merchants... I suppose that nothing can thrive, so long as the Empire remains in power."
2802,Nanna: Ever since I was little I've always wanted to wander the beautiful cities of Miletos and sample all the rare goods on sale... It must have been so lovely once...
2803,"Leif: Nanna... The instant this war is over and we've restored peace to the world, let's come back here... Just the two of us."
2804,Nanna: Why?
2805,"Leif: I once heard a story about my parents... On a visit to Miletos, my father gifted my mother with the most stunning pearl tiara."
2806,Nanna: Did he?
2807,"Leif: He did indeed, and someday... Someday, I'd love to do the same for you, Nanna."
2808,"Nanna: Oh, Lord Leif..."
2809,"Leif: Heh, I suppose I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. We still have an empire to bring down before we do anything else, after all! The end of this blasted war is in sight, Nanna. Now, shall we?"
2810,"Nanna: Of course, Lord Leif!"
2811,"Shannan: You've grown so strong of late, Seliph! You really are your parents' son. There's nothing left for me to teach you."
2812,"Seliph: Thank you, Shannan... For everything. Any might I have springs from your teachings. To me, swordplay is every bit as natural as breathing, and I owe it all to you."
2813,"Shannan: Heh... You think so, do you..."
2814,"Seliph: You look awfully weary, Shannan... Is something amiss? If only I could lend you my strength..."
2815,"Shannan: Hey, come on! You needn't treat me like some old man. I'm as young and spry as ever, you know!"
2816,"Seliph: Oh! My apologies, Shannan... That wasn't what I was-"
2817,"Shannan: Heh, it's fine. ...Thanks anyway, Seliph. It heartens me to know that you care."
2818,"Leif: Is everything alright, Altena? You look rather weary."
2819,"Altena: Oh, Leif... No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
2820,"Leif: Well, if you say so... Listen, Altena. Don't be afraid to ask for my help. If you ever need anything, I'll gladly do all I can."
2821,"Altena: Thanks, Leif. Er, actually... I was thinking of Arion."
2822,Leif: I thought as much... Is it true that someone came to spirit him away after we brought him down?
2823,"Altena: It is, and from what I hear, that someone was Prince Julius..."
2824,Leif: The Empire's crown prince himself?! But why... Why in the world would he do that?
2825,Altena: Perhaps he's trying to win himself a new ally by appealing to Arion.
2826,Leif: That makes sense... And I suppose it means we'll be crossing blades with Thracia's dracoknights again.
2827,Altena: Mm. I'm afraid so. So long as this war continues...
2828,"Leif: To be honest, Altena, I believe this is actually good news."
2829,Altena: Huh? How so?
2830,"Leif: Think about it. So long as Arion is still alive, there is still hope that we can help him. Never give up, Altena. So long as we keep moving forward, surely everything will be fine in the end."
2831,"Altena: Thank you, Leif... I think I'm feeling better already."
2832,"Leif: Oh, thank the gods. I couldn't bear knowing that my sister was in such grief. I'm here for you, Altena. All I want is to ensure your happiness, and I'll do whatever it takes to help you."
2833,"Oifey: Look, sire! The territory of Chalphy awaits us just across the Miletos Strait."
2834,"Seliph: Chalphy... My father's fatherland... I can only imagine all the memories you must have of it, Oifey."
2835,"Oifey: Mm, of course. I don't think there's a single corner of Chalphy which I don't recall fondly... Lord Sigurd and Lady Ethlyn... Naoise, Alec, and all of my other peers among the young knights of Chalphy... Every last face there was a friendly one..."
2836,"Seliph: Hm... I can only imagine, Oifey. I've never so much as set foot in Chalphy, have I?"
2837,"Oifey: Indeed, sire. You were born in Agustria, and raised in Silesse and Isaach. Come ot think of it sire, you've never been anywhere near Grannvale till now."
2838,"Seliph: Quite the sorry excuse for a prince of Grannvale I make, wouldn't you say? It almost feels as if I've tricked the world."
2839,"Oifey: I know, sire, but I pray you understand. This is the will of your citizens, all long abused and stripped of power by the Empire. They've endured decades of suffering beyond compare at the Empire's hands, all in the hope of, one day, seeing the coming of their savior."
2840,Seliph: This savior... Do they believe it to be me?
2841,Oifey: They do. The common folk have long prayed for the second coming of the hero Sigurd. The folklore claims he comes once more in the form of a legendary child whom Sigurd begat with Empress Deirdre.
2842,"Seliph: A legendary child... It's terrifying to know that people have taken to seeing me as some sort of god, Oifey."
2843,"Oifey: Think of it as a product of the sheer brutality of the Empire's regime, sire. Look around you. We stand in a realm where children are snatched from their parents in droves, and all who resist are put to slaughter. No mere human could ever wreak such madness. A great evil lurks behind it all..."
2844,"Seliph: Say, Oifey... I've been hearing tales that Emperor Arvis is the dark god itself. Where do you stand?"
2845,"Oifey: I've heard the same from countless others in our travels, sire, but I doubt it."
2846,"Seliph: Then who could it be? Manfroy, perhaps?"
2847,"Oifey: Sire... Whoever it may be, the dark god's return is fast approaching. We must hurry. Your people have come to revere you as a crusader destined to save them. The time to heed their call is upon us."
2848,"Seliph: Pardon me, Fee. Lewyn would like a word with you. If you need me, I'll be waiting over there."
2849,"Lewyn: Geez, Fee. I haven't seen anyone as stubborn as you since I last saw Erinys!"
2850,Fee: ...
2851,"Lewyn: C'mon, there's no need to get angry! I'm here to apologize, okay? Ignoring you clearly wasn't the best idea I've ever had."
2852,"Fee: What kind of monster are you, Dad?! I... I could've sworn I was seeing things when you first popped up in Rivough! I hadn't been that happy in years, and... And seeing you again had me in tears... But then when I tried talking to you, you wouldn't so much as blink at me! Do you have any idea how it feels to be shunned by your own father, Dad?!"
2853,Lewyn: So you went about pretending you didn't notice me either? Is that it?
2854,"Fee: I figured, why should I bother if you're not gonna bother? I told myself I'd only talk to you if you took the initiative here."
2855,"Lewyn: Heh... Bratty little thing, aren't you..."
2856,"Fee: EXCUSE ME?! Ohh, that does it! I'm not listening to another word of this! Maybe if she hadn't married such an awful man, Mom'd still be with us..."
2857,"Lewyn: Look, Fee. I get it. I really messed things up with Erinys. But what happened is my business and hers. Nobody else's. You and Ced have no right to meddle!"
2858,Fee: Dad-
2859,"Lewyn: There's a war going on here, Fee, and that's the only thing you should be worrying about right now. Understood?"
2860,"Coirpre: Are you hurt at all, Your Highness?"
2861,"Altena: Ah, Coirpre. Thank you, but everything's fine. Don't forget to take care of yourself as well. You shouldn't do anything too risky."
2862,"Coirpre: Er... Say, Your Highness..."
2863,"Altena: Is something wrong, Coirpre?"
2864,"Coirpre: Your Highness, I want to cast a Ward spell on you."
2865,"Altena: Oh, right. You're concerned about my low resistance to magic, aren't you? Are you sure? I've heard that few spells endanger the caster as much as Ward does. Look, Coirpre. I'm honored, but I don't want you risking yourself for my sake."
2866,"Coirpre: But you've always been there to help me, Your Highness. You're the closest thing I've ever had to a mama. Please, Your Highness! All I want is to do anything I can to help you!"
2867,"Altena: Oh, Coirpre... Very well. I can hardly refuse if it's so important to you, now, can I? All I ask is that you stop casting the spell the instant it puts you at any risk at all. Promise me this, Coirpre."
2868,"Coirpre: Okay! It's a promise, Your Highness. Don't worry, I won't let myself get hurt."
2869,"Altena: Thank you, Coirpre. Now, shall we? I'm ready when you are."
2870,"Coirpre: Right, I'm ready! ...Hear me, O great Saint Bragi. ...I implore of you! Bestow upon this woman your exalted power..."
2871,"The reason given was: Needs more html markups as seen on Birth of the Holy Knight/Script, as well as translations and formatting..
"
2872,"Seliph's long journey is drawing to a close. His army's victories are a beacon of hope to the Empire's victims, and a wave of further rebellions sweeps across Jugdral. First, Silesse was wrestled back from imperial control by its citizens, and soon after Agustria's people flocked to arms, burning to fight for their country. But Grannvale itself yet stands. Duke Brian of Dozel and the axe knights of the Grau Ritter; Duke Scipio of Yngvi and his elite archers, the Beige Ritter; and Friege's Queen Hilda and the war-mages of the Gelb Ritter stand between Seliph and the capital. Belhalla itself lurks under an eerie silence, as Ishtar and the enigmatic twelve Deadlords lie in wait to defend Prince Julius himself. Over a year has passed since that fateful first battle in Isaach. The tragic struggle pitting kin versus kin wears on, splitting the Twelve Crusaders between the light and the dark... So begins the final holy war...
"
2873,"Not bad, innit?
"
2874,"Julius: Father died, you say..."
2875,"Manfroy: The Emperor had long served his purpose, Your Majesty. He was little more than an obstacle to your ambitions. He had to die."
2876,"Julius: Pfeh. I almost feel sorry for him. All his life he was your tool, Manfroy, only to be thrown away so casually..."
2877,"Manfroy: All in your empire's name, Your Majesty. Arvis was a lost cause. To think he, a man of Loptous's blood, dared to challenge the revival of the empire! The righteous heart of the crusader Fjalar burned too fiercely within him. It was only a matter of time until he turned on you."
2878,"Julius: I know, I know... Now, then. I hear those rebels have stumbled as far as Chalphy. Are our defenses really that pathetic?"
2879,"Manfroy: Rest assured. I've already tasked Edda's Bishop Rodan and Brian of Dozel with purging Chalphy of those vermin. You've no need to worry, Your Majesty."
2880,"Julius: Don't I, now... Where's Julia?"
2881,Manfroy: She awaits her end in the dungeon... You there! Bring us Princess Julia!
2882,Julia: ...
2883,"Julius: Ah, Julia. It's been a while, hasn't it? Tell me, do you know who I am?"
2884,"Julia: Julius... My brother, Julius..."
2885,Julius: Oho! So you do still remember! I can hardly believe seven long years have passed since you slipped away.
2886,"Julia: I... That night is seared into my memory, clear as if it were only yesterday..."
2887,Julius: Fehehe... Good. I trust you remember your mother's final kindness as well?
2888,"Julia: Who... No, what are you? That night... The night Manfroy came with that eerie black tome... Nothing was ever the same again. My real brother, the kind and caring boy I once knew and loved so, died that night. In his place stood a demon of terrifying power... My brother in name only. You... You monster... You've taken my mother and my brother from me! Who are you? WHAT are you? Why... Why must you torment us all so?!"
2889,"Julius: I am the heir of Loptous's kin, and the inheritor of his limitless power. This world belongs rightfully to me. And you, Julia? You are the heiress to the power of Naga, my eternal foe. I cannot allow you to live any longer!"
2890,"Manfroy: Hold a moment, Your Majesty. I believe I have a use for this girl's power. If I may, spare her and leave her to me."
2891,"Julius: Using Naga's power to serve me? Interesting... Very interesting. Very well! I must return to Belhalla. Julia is yours, Manfroy. But be warned. Be extremely careful! Even a single mistake with her could cost me dearly."
2892,"Rodan: His Majesty has issued his command. Priest and sellsword units! Defend Edda itself with your very lives! Cavalry unit, move in on Chalphy! Reclaim our land from the rebels!"
2893,"Lewyn: This is it, Seliph. The final holy war begins now."
2894,Seliph: A holy war?
2895,"Lewyn: Yeah, that's what this is. Julius is descended from Loptyrian royalty, and he's been working to revive the dark empire. No matter what it takes, we must stop him."
2896,"Seliph: It feels as if you know everything, Lewyn. I'm beginning to feel left out... Please, what in the world are you talking about?"
2897,"Lewyn: Yeah, sorry about that, Seliph. I know there's a lot I've not been telling you. I've spent over a decade on a journey to figure out the truth behind all this, and I'm finally onto a hidden bigger picture here."
2898,Seliph: ...The bigger picture?
2899,"Lewyn: It seems the old Loptrian Empire's founder, the Bishop Galle, dedicated his youth to a world-exploring voyage across the seas. He desired nothing less than to drink the blood of a legendary beast. Even a single drop, he believed, would bestow upon any human limitless power."
2900,Seliph: Do... do you mean the dragonkin of old? It couldn't be... Is that not a myth?
2901,"Lewyn: You'd think so, but... When Galle returned to Jugdral, he bore bizarre powers nobody else understood. With these powers, he set to work swaying youths across the land to aid his ambitions. Before anyone else realized, he'd raised a fell legion unflinchingly loyal to his cause."
2902,"Seliph: Where, then, does Loptous enter the tale?"
2903,Lewyn: Odds are Loptous was a dragon himself. Every last one of Galle's heirs has borne the blood of the dragonkin. The dark powers Loptous's kin command are nothing more than the dragonkin's powers.
2904,Seliph: And what of the Crusaders?
2905,Lewyn: I'm sure you know how the legend goes. The gods descended upon twelve warriors of the old liberators at the fortress of Darna. But...
2906,Seliph: But?
2907,"Lewyn: Sorry, Seliph, but this'll have to wait. The enemy's just about on our doorstep."
2908,"Lewyn: Edda, huh... Father Claud would be so happy to know his homeland is finally free..."
2909,Seliph: Mm... Father Claud gave his life for my father's cause. But his children...
2910,"Lewyn: Oh, of course. <Claud's son> and <Claud's daughter>. They're going to be great rulers for Edda. And after all they've been through, I know that'll bring a smile to the people's faces."
2911,"Lewyn: Edda, huh... Father Claud would be so happy to know his homeland is finally free..."
2912,Seliph: Mm... Father Claud gave his life for my father's cause. But his children...
2913,"Lewyn: That’s deplorable, but there’s nobody to succeed House Edda. Seliph, from now on, you’ll have to protect it."
2914,"Brian: It's time, Fisher. Your unit will move in on Edda at once! I'll lead the assault on Chalphy personally. Against the full force of Dozel's legendary axe knights, the Grau Ritter, the rebels stand no chance! They'll drop like leaves!"
2915,"Fisher: At once, milord!"
2916,"Lewyn: What a bloody disgrace... How could a pack of idiots like House Dozel be of Crusader heritage? If it weren't for Lombard, the world wouldn't be in such a mess..."
2917,"Seliph: Lewyn, I cannot wait much longer. Just where did the Crusaders' power come from? What in the world are these gods?"
2918,"Lewyn: I can't say for sure... But whatever they were, they realized that our land's misery was caused by the power of the dragonkin. And so they came to Jugdral from some other world to save the human race. It was they who suddenly appeared at Darna, just as its doom seemed certain."
2919,"Seliph: That would be the legendary descent of Naga and the eleven gods found in scripture, yes?"
2920,"Lewyn: Yeah. They say the gods took human shapes. Naga, the light god, appeared as a little girl, while the fire god Salamand was an old man. With twelve chosen warriors, the gods bound themselves in a blood covenant."
2921,Seliph: A blood covenant?
2922,"Lewyn: Basically, the gods drew their own blood with a scratch to the fingertip and presented it to the warriors."
2923,Seliph: ...I beg your pardon?!
2924,"Lewyn: Long story short, they were dragons. The gods we know only from scripture? They were all of the dragonkin, just like Loptous. With a single taste of the blood of dragons, these once humble warriors of the liberation army were reborn as the Twelve Crusaders. Each dragon presented to their crusader a weapon steeped in their own power. And then, with some final parting words of wisdom to the Crusaders, the dragonkin departed Jugdral."
2925,"Seliph: I see... So our power is, in truth, that of dragons..."
2926,"Lewyn: Now, Loptous himself is actually from a dragon clan whose fell power is amongst the mightiest of all dragonkin. The great dragon Naga, strongest of them all, bestowed their own blood upon the leader of the liberation army, the priest Heim. Naga knew only their power could possibly hope to stand against that of Loptous."
2927,Seliph: So nobody else among the dragonkin would be able to prevail against Loptous?
2928,"Lewyn: It certainly wouldn't be easy, I think. Even if you had every last dragon fighting together, they'd still need Naga's power. This, of course, means that if we're to win today, we'll need the surviving heir to Saint Heim. In other words, one of Deirdre's three children. Of those three, you didn't inherit the full breadth of Naga's blood, and it's pretty obvious that Julius didn't. Actually, I only recently learned who it is. The inheritor of Naga's power is Julius' twin sister... Princess Julia."
2929,Seliph: E-excuse me?!
2930,"Lewyn: Yeah, that was more or less my reaction too at first. Julia is Julius' twin sister... which also makes her your sister, Seliph."
2931,Seliph: So all this time... Julia was my sister...
2932,"Lewyn: I guess now we know why Manfroy took her to begin with. Needless to say, Seliph, we've got to rescue her, no matter what. We absolutely need Julia's powers if we want any hope of stopping Julius!"
2933,"Hilda: Dozel's fallen to the rebels? What the hell were my men doing out there?! Feh, why'd I ever expect any better? Worthless cowards, the lot of them! It's time I took this into my own hands. All I need is to lure these flies into my web. Then I can crush them, once and for all! Send Scipio of Jungby a messenger! Pass on to him this plan. The Gelb Ritter will coax the rebels our way, leaving them wide open to a deluge of the Beige Ritter's arrows from behind! They'll have nowhere to run or hide. Kill them all! No survivors this time!"
2934,"Scipio: Heh, the rebels marched right into the trap. All too easy. Men, cut through the forest and swarm them from the rear! With Friege at their front, we'll choke them like a snake on a rat!"
2935,"Seliph: Friege is ours, Lewyn. We've finally made it this far. But... I can't help but wonder... Are the children at Belhalla still unharmed? I pray they are..."
2936,"Lewyn: Funny you should say that! We've got a visitor who's got a bit of news on that front, Seliph."
2937,Seliph: And who are you?
2938,"Felipe: My name is Felipe, sire. I was once an aide to the late Emperor Arvis. On secret orders from His Majesty, the abducted children were moved here to Friege for safe-keeping."
2939,Seliph: What? Is this true? You've saved all of the children?!
2940,"Felipe: Rest easy, sire. They're all hiding in the city's abbey, and they're all in good health."
2941,"Seliph: And all under Hilda's nose, at that! That you've kept every last child safe in Hilda's own city... Color me impressed."
2942,"Felipe: Actually, sire... Princess Ishtar deserves your thanks. Without her generous aid given in secret, we could never have done this. No Imperial soldiers dared come even close to the abbey, on pain of the princess' wrath."
2943,Seliph: Princess Ishtar?! But why... Why would she-
2944,"Felipe: Few people in this land are as kind and caring as Princess Ishtar. All along, the princess has toiled behind the scenes to aid our cause. It was Princess Ishtar herself who ensured that every last child escaped from the bowels of Belhalla."
2945,"Seliph: I see... At any rate, thank the gods for their safety. I'm certain everyone will be glad to know the children are in good hands. You have my deepest thanks, Lord Felipe."
2946,"Lewyn: Well, Seliph, that's one job done. Good to see we're finally getting some results out of this mess."
2947,"Seliph: Mm. And yet, Julia still eludes us... Where could she possibly be?"
2948,Lewyn: The only options left now are Belhalla and Velthomer. It's got to be one of those two.
2949,Seliph: And Belhalla is where Julius awaits...
2950,"Lewyn: Yeah, we'll have to find Julia first if we want to go anywhere near Belhalla. Without Julia's power on our side, we won't have a hope in hell against Julius."
2951,"Seliph: But no matter what's happened, Julius is still her brother. Will she even want to fight him..."
2952,Lewyn: ...You'll have to convince her.
2953,"Ishtar: If I may, Lord Julius, I'd like to lead the Weissritter to bolster the capital's defense. This will require that I leave your side, even for a while. I beg your forgiveness."
2954,"Julius: Feh. Why the rush to get out there so suddenly, Ishtar? All the soldiers they could ever throw at us could never so much as scratch me. Why even bother with those maggots?"
2955,"Ishtar: Yes, I know... But for me, there is no greater pride than being one of Friege's great mages. My parents and brother lie dead, and I cannot stand to leave their murderers to run amok... Please... All I ask is a chance for vengeance."
2956,"Julius: It sounds as if what you really want is to join your family in death on a rebel's blade! Are you so desperate to escape me, Ishtar?"
2957,"Ishtar: No... Nothing like that, Lord Julius. I love you. Nothing will ever change that."
2958,Julius: Hmhmhmhmhm... I know. Very well! Fight if you must. I won't stop you.
2959,"Ishtar: Thank you... Now, I beg your pardon. Meng! Bleg! Maybell! We sortie at once!"
2960,"Meng: Yes, milady."
2961,"Julius: Now, then. I think it's time we put an end to this sorry show. Deadlords, move out! And someone order Arion's unit to attack! The time for games is over. Every last rebel dies, here and now!"
2962,"Manfroy: Heh heh... The rebels have come to play at last, I hear. Julia, why don't you join them? Purge all those who dare oppose the Empire!"
2963,Julia: YES... MY LORD... YOUR EXCELLENCY...
2964,"Arion: We have no home to return to, men... But we must keep going nonetheless. Chalphy's fall to our blades shall be the first step to winning back our fatherland. Now, move in! Show these liberators one final defiance from the dracoknights of Thracia!"
2965,Altena: That's enough Arion! Why? Why in the world do you still refuse to see reason?!
2966,Arion: Altena?!
2967,Altena: How could you be so craven?! How dare you place your own vanity and pride over what truly matters!
2968,"Arion: What do you want from me, then?"
2969,"Altena: Take a good, hard look at Prince Seliph! Ask yourself this: why is he still fighting? For whom is he out here day after day, setting his own suffering to the side?"
2970,"Arion: So Seliph fights for justice, and I somehow do not? Is that what you're trying to say..."
2971,"Altena: Very well, Arion... If you won't see reason, so be it. Come on. Kill me. End this. My... My life is in your hands, Arion. ...I die with no regrets."
2972,"Arion: A-Altena... Very well. You can rest easy now. I get it. I was wrong... My mercenary days are at an end, and my final task is with Seliph... Wait, no... With you. I now fight for you, Altena."
2973,Altena: Arion...
2974,"Seliph: Julia! What in blazes has happened to you? Come on, wake up!"
2975,Julia: HA HA HA... DEATH TO ALL... WHO DARE TO CHALLENGE LORD MANFROY...
2976,"Lewyn: This isn't going to work, Seliph. An evil spell's got Julia strung up like a puppet. I think we should deal with Manfroy first. We can come back for Julia once he's gone."
2977,Seliph: Julia! Wake up... Please!
2978,Julia: ...
2979,Julia: ......Nnh... Lord Seliph?! I... why am I here?
2980,Seliph: You can thank Manfroy's dark arts. He brainwashed you into his service.
2981,"Julia: Manfroy... Oh, that's right... That man who caught me..."
2982,Seliph: Thank goodness you're safe...
2983,"Julia: Lord Seliph, I-"
2984,"Seliph: It's fine, Julia. I know. Lewyn already told me everything. I'm sorry... I am so sorry. I failed to protect you..."
2985,"Julia: No... It's fine. Don't worry, Seliph. I finally know why I've survived for all these years. I know my fate... I'm fated to fight. I'll never run away again!"
2986,"Seliph: Your strength and courage is such an inspiration, Julia... But you're right. This is the will of fate, tragic as it is. None can afford to cower or flee now. Until the bitter end, we must march on..."
2987,"Seliph: Are we quite certain the Book of Naga is in fact hidden in Velthomer, Lewyn?"
2988,"Lewyn: Yep. All the evidence we have points to Arvis taking it from Belhalla and keeping it hidden here. That's right, isn't it, Felipe?"
2989,"Felipe: Indeed, sir. It should still lie inn the treasury. That said, it is likely sealed in a locked case."
2990,Lewyn: Huh. Any idea where its key is?
2991,"Felipe: My liege concealed the key within his most treasured memento... The circlet once worn by Empress Deirdre. If we can find that circlet, sir, then the Book of Naga is yours."
2992,"Lewyn: Deirdre's circlet, huh..."
2993,"Lewyn: Okay, Julia. This is the treasury. Try fitting the gemstone on your circlet into that niche there."
2994,Julia: Here we go...
2995,"Lewyn: It worked... It really worked! There it is! The Book of Naga! And it's yours for the taking, Julia!"
2996,"Julia: Wow, I... Oh! How strange... It feels so warm... It's almost as if I've known this book all my life..."
2997,"Manfroy: W, what’s happening!? Oh no! The life-force of darkness is fading… Nyaagh… Lopt... ous…"
2998,"Julia: Ah… What was I… Ah, Manfroy… his black magic was controlling me. Seliph came to my rescue… I’m sure of it!"
2999,"Old man: Oh, heirs to the courageous! Hear my ode to the crusaders of old. O Black Knight Hoðr, Mystletainn the demonic in hand, smite the devil O Sword Saint Od, Balmung the divine in hand, repel the blight O Holy Knight Baldr, Tyrfing the sacred in hand, shine a light And at last, O Saint Heim, Book of Naga in hand, pray to the heavens above Prayer begets light, Light begets the white dragon Foe of the shadow dragon Black and white Light and dark An eternal struggle Shall our prayers yield victory Or shall it be death? And yet have no fear For our battle is a beginning And defeat is never the end The flame of light we seek Is eternal, undying, never lost And in all who follow us I shall believe And in all who bear the light I shall believe"
3000,"Old man: Hear me, brave heirs to the crusaders! In your hands lies the task of proving this war to be a holy war of its own. If wisdom, courage and power be your allies, summon them now and give all you have, should you wish to prevail this day. Trust in yourselves to bring forth our destiny, one born where the two trails of light meet!"
3001,"Arthur: This is it, Teeny. We're getting awfully close to Friege... Mother's old home."
3002,"Tine: Mm, but... I have a bad feeling about this. How about you?"
3003,"Arthur: Yes, I suppose... I've had nothing but hatred for Friege ever since they took you and Mother. All I've ever wanted is to crush them all for all they've done..."
3004,"Tine: But... What about Uncle Bloom, Ishtar and Ishtore? Haven't I told you about them before? They were all decent people. At the very least, they were always nice to Mother and I..."
3005,"Arthur: Oh, right. It was Hilda who drove Mother to her death, wasn't it?"
3006,"Tine: It was... Even after all this time, I still hate her so much. All I want is to be the one to put an end to her myself..."
3007,"Arthur: Don't worry, Tine. As long as I live, you won't have to deal with anything like that ever again. I'll protect you, no matter what!"
3008,"Amid: Linda, we’re getting pretty close to mother’s homeland."
3009,Linda: Yeah… I wish I could be happier about it. What’re you thinking?
3010,Amid: I’ve resented the Frieges since the day they took you and mother away from me. I can’t tell you how much I’ve wanted to smash their skulls in…
3011,"Linda: Hey Amid, what made mum defect Friege and join Sigurd’s army?"
3012,Amid: She joined because her sister died fighting for Sigurd’s army. The two were real close.
3013,"Linda: She was our aunt, huh…"
3014,Amid: Yeah. I think her name was Tailtiu.
3015,Linda: She died in battle… How sad…
3016,Tine: Seliph…
3017,"Seliph: Tinny! Get back, would you?"
3018,"Tine: Please, I want to help out, too!"
3019,"Seliph: I know, but… I just don’t want to lose you!"
3020,"Tine: Well, I’m not budging. I’m not letting what happened to Diadora to happen to me too! Please, Seliph… Just let me stay near you!"
3021,"Seliph: …Yeah, you’re right. I’m sorry. We do need to stay close, don’t we? C’mon, Tine. Let’s get going. This is your chance to shine for me."
3022,Tine: You got it!
3023,"Tine: Ced, are you alright?"
3024,"Ced: Yeah, I’m fine. But you need to watch it, Tinny. This enemy is a tough one."
3025,Tine: I know. I’ll be safe as long as I’m with you.
3026,"Ced: You’re beautiful, Tinny. You know that? You mean the world to me."
3027,"Tine: Ced, quit it! You’re embarrassing me…"
3028,"Ced: Hahaha… Sorry, I just had to say it while I had the chance."
3029,Tine: Ced… be careful.
3030,"Tine: Leif, are you alright?"
3031,"Leif: Yes, I’m fine. But you need to watch it, Tine. This enemy is a tough one."
3032,Tine: I know. I’ll be safe as long as I’m with you.
3033,Leif: We both need to be careful. We have the great task of re-unifying Thracia before us.
3034,Tine: I can’t wait to return to Alster. I really want to work for the people when I get back.
3035,"Leif: Not just Alster, Tine… Remember, you’ll be queen of the New Thracia!"
3036,"Tine: That’s right, isn’t it!"
3037,"Patty: Seliph, here you go!"
3038,"Seliph: Wow, you made lunch! This is for me, is it? Thanks a lot, Patty."
3039,Patty: …and here’s your drink.
3040,"Seliph: Wow, really? Geez… thanks! This is just what I needed."
3041,Patty: And this is to top it off… Here.
3042,Seliph: Er… what’s this?
3043,Patty: It’s my own home brewed stamina drink. It’ll give you a little boost. Now don’t waste it!
3044,"Seliph: N, no. I won’t."
3045,Patty: Prince Shannan!
3046,Shannan: Hm…
3047,"Patty: What’s wrong with you? Look, I made us lunch."
3048,"Shannan: What do you think this is, a picnic or something?"
3049,"Patty: I know, but I’m bored. There’s nothin’ to do around here."
3050,"Shannan: That doesn’t give you the right to get in my way now, does it? We’re on the battlefield here."
3051,Patty: How rude! Do I bother you that much!? …And here I went out of my way to make us lunch. You’ve got some nerve!!
3052,"Shannan: Patty, look… I’m sorry I said that. Can you forgive me this once?"
3053,"Patty: Will you eat the lunch then? Really? Oh, I’m so glad! I love you, Shannan!"
3054,"Patty: Lester, lunch is ready!"
3055,"Lester: Patty, you made it! Whew… I seriously thought I was going to pass out there."
3056,"Patty: I knew you were hurtin’, so I made it jumbo size today. So how is it?"
3057,"Lester: Superb! Your cooking is the best, Patty!"
3058,Patty: Hehe… You know it!
3059,Daisy: Hey Deimne. What’re you up to?
3060,"Deimne: I don’t know… Actually, I’m a little depressed."
3061,Daisy: Why’s that?
3062,Deimne: Don’t you feel like we’re kinda not needed here?
3063,"Daisy: Hmm… Now that you say it, I don’t think they need us at all here!"
3064,"Deimne: That’s just what I mean. Look, I’m going to go back to Isaach and find a regular job."
3065,"Daisy: Yeah, I’m pooped. Hey, why don’t we go back together when this is all finished?"
3066,Deimne: Look at us… …We’re so hopeless.”
3067,Jeanne: Leaf!
3068,Leif: Er… Jeanne? I told you to stay back at the castle.
3069,Jeanne: But I…
3070,"Leif: Look, anybody not of Crusader blood should not be out here fighting."
3071,"Jeanne: I know… I don’t mean to be a burden on everyone, but can’t I at least use my staff?"
3072,"Leif: Hmm, you’ve got a point. Alright… but promise me you’ll stay well clear of any combat. As the queen of the New Thracia, I can’t afford to lose you."
3073,"Jeanne: Don’t worry, Leaf. I promise I’ll be careful."
3074,"Muirne: Asaello… Look, I know how you feel, but you really should let them handle this."
3075,"Asaello: Man, if only I had a little Crusader blood in me… I’d be tearin’ the enemy up!"
3076,"Muirne: Well, lots of us wish we were of Crusader lineage, but look on the bright side. We’ve been fortunate just to be able to come this far. Most commoners like us never get such a chance."
3077,Asaello: Commoners… Life’s so unfair. Everyone else around here is either of royalty or nobility.
3078,"Muirne: Cheer up, Asaello! You’ve got a whole fan club of kids who are dying for you to get back!"
3079,"Asaello: Yeah, I guess I can’t complain. I do have you after all, too."
3080,Muirne: Hehehe… Asaello…
3081,Nanna: Seliph…
3082,"Seliph: Nanna… we’ve still got a tough battle ahead of us, so just play it safe, alright?"
3083,"Nanna: I will. But you’ve got me worried, Seliph. Please, don’t push yourself too hard."
3084,"Seliph: I know, but we’ve come this far… I just can’t let up now."
3085,"Nanna: Well, I’ll do my best to look out for you. You’re always in my prayers, Seliph."
3086,"Seliph: Thanks, Nanna. Believe me, I really appreciate all the times you’ve helped me out."
3087,"Nanna: Any time, Seliph. Any time…"
3088,"Nanna: Ares, take it easy out here. You still have a monumental task awaiting you."
3089,"Ares: I haven’t forgotten, believe me. I’ve no intention of dying in this war. I will not rest until Agustria has attained the glory my father envisioned for it."
3090,"Nanna: I know you can do it, Ares. Your father would be so proud of you…"
3091,"Ares: But I can’t do it alone, Nanna. I need you."
3092,"Nanna: Of course, Ares. My life is yours. I’m not making the same mistake my mother did."
3093,Ares: What… his own sister fell in love with him?
3094,"Nanna: Yes… she did. But it’s not all that strange, really. They had different mothers."
3095,"Ares: Hey, that reminds me. You and I are cousins, aren’t we…"
3096,"Nanna: Yeah, that’s right. Hehehe…"
3097,"Nanna: Leif, when do you think we’ll be through fighting?"
3098,Leif: That’s hard to say… but I can’t help but think that our victory is close at hand.
3099,Nanna: Will we be returning to Leonster after all this?
3100,"Leif: That’s the plan. My father’s dream was to bring peace to the Thracia Peninsula and create one nation. I intend to bring his dream to life, and I’ll need your help to see it through, Nanna."
3101,"Nanna: Leif, wherever you go, I shall follow… even to the ends of the continent."
3102,"Lana: Seliph, we’ve just a little more go…"
3103,"Seliph: Yeah. You’ve meant a lot to me out here, Lana. I really mean that."
3104,"Lana: Well, I don’t know if I’ve actually done anything… But I’m content just being by your side."
3105,"Seliph: Lana, we go pretty far back, don’t we… I remember us always hanging out as kids."
3106,"Lana: Uh-huh. I have so many good memories from back then, but I never thought you and I…"
3107,"Seliph: But I’ve always liked you, Lana…"
3108,"Lana: I know… but it’s just hard for me to accept that, Seliph. I feel so awful to Julia…"
3109,Seliph: Lana…
3110,Lana: Ulster…
3111,Ulster: What’s up?
3112,"Lana: You make me proud, you know that?"
3113,"Ulster: Hey, what’re you gettin’ all sentimental on me for?"
3114,"Lana: Ulster, you promise me you won’t get killed out here, okay?"
3115,Ulster: Don’t you worry… I’d never leave you.
3116,Lana: Ulster… …
3117,Ulster: …yeah?
3118,Lana: …I love you.
3119,Lana: Febail…
3120,Febail: What’s up?
3121,"Lana: You make me proud, you know that?"
3122,Febail: Hey… why’re you getting all sentimental on me?
3123,"Lana: Febail, you promise me you won’t get killed out here, okay?"
3124,Febail: Don’t you worry… I’d never leave you.
3125,Lana: Febail… …
3126,Febail: …yeah?
3127,Lana: …I love you.
3128,"Larcei: Seliph, wait up!"
3129,Seliph: Larcei?
3130,Larcei: I’m coming with you!
3131,"Seliph: Sure, that’s fine with me. Everything alright?"
3132,"Larcei: I… I’m just a little scared, that’s all."
3133,"Seliph: Really? Geez, that sure doesn’t sound like you, Larcei."
3134,Larcei: I just…
3135,"Seliph: Hey, don’t worry about it. I’d feel better if you were with me anyway."
3136,Larcei: Seliph…
3137,"Larcei: Iuchar, you alright?"
3138,"Iuchar: I hate to admit it, but even I’m having a hard time keeping up out here. But with your love I shall prevail… you wait and see!"
3139,"Larcei: …right. Hmph… Well, I fell for you, so I guess I’m stuck with you."
3140,"Iuchar: Love makes no mistakes, my darling. Now let’s see a smile!"
3141,"Larcei: Sure. You hang in there, Iuchar."
3142,Iuchar: Ah… Larcei…
3143,"Larcei: Iucharba, you okay?"
3144,"Iucharba: This battle is proving to be a tough one… even for me. At least we got Dozel back… Alright, I’m going back in."
3145,Larcei: You be careful out here! You’re the one who has to get the duchy back on its feet.
3146,"Iucharba: Yeah, I know… Besides, I’d never get over my father’s and brothers’ deaths if I left things as they are. Larcei, you’re with me on this one, aren’t you?"
3147,Larcei: Uh-huh. I guess you could say I sort of owe you.
3148,"Iucharba: Yeow… that’s my girl! You’re the best, Larceei!"
3149,"Larcei: Iucharba, you freak!"
3150,"Larcei: We’ve come pretty far, haven’t we…"
3151,"Shannan: Yeah, it’s been quite a journey."
3152,Larcei: I wonder how everyone’s doing in Isaac… I hope they’re alright.
3153,"Shannan: Sounds like you’re a little homesick, Larcei…"
3154,"Larcei: Absolutely not! I’m not a child anymore, you know."
3155,Shannan: Heh… Could’ve fooled me.
3156,Larcei: Shannan!!
3157,"Shannan: Hahaha… Just calm down, alright? You’re spoiling your good looks."
3158,Larcei: Shannan…
3159,"Fee: Oifey, how about I go get a close up on the enemy?"
3160,"Oifey: That’s not a good idea, Fee. They’d shoot you right out of the sky."
3161,Fee: Oifey.. um…
3162,"Oifey: What’s on your mind, Fee?"
3163,Fee: It’s really admirable that you’ve devoted your life to keeping Prince Seliph safe.
3164,Oifey: Hm… We abandoned Sir Sigurd’s army right at the battle’s peak. It’s not something I’m proud of. But the mission awaiting us was a fate worse than death. That went for your folks as well.
3165,"Fee: I feel I’ve gotten to know my parents better recently… like the kind of lives they lived. All the talks we’ve had together have really helped clear up my past, Oifey."
3166,"Oifey: Well, Erinys helped me out a lot back then. Perhaps I’ve been able to repay some of that debt to her through you."
3167,"Fee: I still have so much to learn from you, Oifey. I want to be more grown-up."
3168,"Oifey: There’s no need to rush yourself, Fee. That’ll happen in good time."
3169,Fee: Oifey! You gotta let me catch up before you get all old on me!
3170,Oifey: Whoa… Hold on a second there!
3171,"Fee: Seliph, how about I go get a close up on the enemy?"
3172,"Seliph: Forget it, Fee! This battle isn’t like the others. Don’t you dare leave my side!"
3173,Fee: If you say so…
3174,"Seliph: Fee, are you worried about Silesse?"
3175,"Fee: Yeah, a little. It sounds like they all started fighting too.”"
3176,Seliph: The Isaachians staged an uprising. It’s going rather well from the sounds of it.
3177,Fee: Really? I’m so glad to hear it!
3178,"Seliph: You probably want to get back home, don’t you…"
3179,Fee: No way! I’m not leaving your side.
3180,"Seliph: Wow… Thanks, Fee. I’m glad to hear it."
3181,Fee: Seliph… you’re like a dream come true for me. I wanna stay with you forever…
3182,"Fee: Arthur, what’re you doing?"
3183,Arthur: I’m fighting! What’s it look like!? Must be nice to be so carefree all the time.
3184,"Fee: Well! It’s nice to see you, too!"
3185,"Arthur: There you go again. See, it’s no wonder nobody…"
3186,"Fee: …wants to be around me? Is that what you want to say!? Well, forget you!"
3187,Arthur: Fee! All I’m saying is people get the wrong impression about you sometimes. But I’m crazy about you…
3188,Fee: Arthur… You really mean that?
3189,"Arthur: Of course I do. Once this war finishes, you and I are moving back to Silesse."
3190,"Fee: Really!? Oh, Arthur! That’d be perfect!"
