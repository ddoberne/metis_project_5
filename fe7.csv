2,??: Are you awake?
3,Girl: I found you unconscious on the plains.
4,"Lyn: I am Lyn, of the Lorca tribe. You're safe now. Who are you? Can you remember your name?"
5,Lyn: Your name is Tactician? What an odd-sounding name... But pay me no mind. It is a good name. I see by your attire that you are a traveler. What brings you to the Sacae plains? Would you share your story with me?
6,"Lyn: Hm? What was that noise? (Lyn turns towards Mark) I'll go see what's happening. Tactician, wait here for me."
7,"Lyn: Oh no! Bandits! They must have come down from the Bern Mountains! They must be planning on raiding the local villages. I... I have to stop them! If that's all of them, I think I can handle them on my own. (Lyn turns towards Mark) You'll be safe in here, Tactician."
8,"Lyn: What? You want to help? Well, can you use a weapon? Ah, I see... So you're a strategist by trade? An odd profession, but... Very well. We'll go together!"
9,"Lyn: Over here! (Lyn turns towards Mark) If you want to help, Tactician, I could use your advice. I'll protect you, so stay close to me."
10,"In-game message: Unit information: Lyn is the blue unit. The enemy units are red. Tactician, you are green. Essentially, battle consists of blue (allied) units and red (enemy) units taking turns moving on the field. You're only here as a strategist, Tactician. You will only appear during special events. Your job as strategist is to place the cursor on blue units to issue their orders. First, select a unit. Place the cursor on Lyn and press the A Button."
11,Lyn: I need to be closer from the enemy!
12,"In-game message: You have selected Lyn. When a unit is selected, the map changes color like so. Lyn can move anywhere in the blue area."
13,"In-game message: Move her to the space with the flashing cursor. Place your cursor there, and then press the A Button to finish."
14,Lyn: Let's advance on that bandit!
15,"Lyn: Yes, this should be close enough."
16,Lyn: Uh-oh! That bandit's spotted me! He's coming this way!
17,Lyn: Let's close in and attack!
18,In-game message: Select Lyn.
19,In-game message: Move to one of the areas adjacent to the bandit.
20,Lyn: I have to be right next to him to attack!
21,"Lyn: Listen, just get me up to that bandit!"
22,In-game message: Press the A Button after placing the cursor next to the enemy.
23,"Lyn: Now, strike!"
24,In-game message: Select attack!
25,Lyn: Victory! But I've been injured. I have need of a vulnerary.
26,In-game message: Select Lyn.
27,Lyn: There's another bandit over by the ger to the west. You don't know what a ger is? It's a type of round hut. Many nomads live in huts like these. Hmm... I would do well to use this time to administer a little first aid.
28,In-game message: Move to the space marked by the flashing cursor.
29,Lyn: I'm carrying a couple of vulneraries in my satchel. They should heal me up. Would you get one for me?
30,"In-game message: Open the Item menu and select a vulnerary. Next, choose Use."
31,"Lyn: Thank you, Tactician! Now, let's go get that brigand over by the ger!"
32,Batta: Who do you think you are? You think you can stand up to Batta the Beast?
33,"Lyn: Whew! He's tough... It all comes down to this next blow. Tactician, if I fall, I want you to flee. You must escape!"
34,Batta: What? How... How did you--
35,Lyn: Whew... That was close. I sorely underestimated him. Sorry if I worried you. I'll need to get stronger if I'm going to survive... Strong enough that no one can defeat me.
36,"In-game message: Lyn gains experience in each encounter. When she has enough experience, she will level up. As she increases in level, her abilities improve. Over time, she will grow much stronger. It's time to bring this chapter to a close. Select Lyn and move her to the gate where Batta the Beast was standing. Select Seize to complete Lyn's victory and your victory!"
37,"Lyn: Good work, Tactician! Let's go home."
38,"Lyn: Good morning, Tactician! Are you awake yet?"
39,"Lyn: That fight yesterday must have taken a lot out of you. Say, Tactician... I want to talk to you about something. You have some experience in the ways of war, I can see. Would you allow me to travel with you?"
40,Lyn: What? You...want me to get permission from my parents?
41,"Lyn: My mother and my father...died six months ago. My people—the Lorca—they don't... I'm the last of my tribe. Bandits attacked, and... they killed so many people. The tribe was scattered. My father was our chieftain, and I wanted to protect our people. But I'm so young, and our people were old-fashioned. They wouldn't follow a woman. No one would follow me."
42,"Lyn: Sniff... I'm sorry. I've been alone for so long... No, no more. I will shed no more tears. ... ... ... ..."
43,"Lyn: Thank you. I'm better now. Tactician, I want—I must become stronger so I may avenge my father's death! Yesterday's battle taught me something. I won't become stronger by sitting here alone. Tactician, tell me you'll train me, that you'll let me travel with you!"
44,"Lyn: You will? That's wonderful! Thank you! Oh, thank you! We'll be better off working together, I know it. You'll be my master strategist, and I'll be your peerless warrior! We can do it! Right?"
45,"In-game message: Travel with Lyn, Tactician. Give her your aid, and master the art of combat. Complete the tasks set out in each chapter, and help Lyn in her quest. Turn the instruction window on or off by pressing SELECT."

48,"The apprentice tactician Tactician and the young swordfighter Lyn. A strange pair on an even stranger journey. To prepare for the long road ahead, they go to Bulgar, the commercial center of Sacae. Unbeknownst to Lyn, she will discover something that will alter her life forever.
"
49,"Lyn: Tactician! Over here! This is Bulgar, the biggest city in all of Sacae. We should purchase supplies for our journey."
50,"??: Oh, my heart! What a dazzling vision of loveliness!"
51,Lyn: Hm?
52,"Man: Wait, O beauteous one! Would you not favor me? Or better yet, your company?"
53,"Lyn: Where are you from, sir knight, that you speak so freely to a stranger?"
54,"Man: Ha! I thought you'd never ask! I am from Lycia. I hail from the Caelin canton, home to men of passion and fire!"
55,"Lyn: Shouldn't that be ""home to callow oafs with loose tongues""?"
56,Man: Ooooh... You're even lovely when you're cruel.
57,"Lyn: Let's go, Tactician. I've nothing more to say."
58,Man: Wait! Please...
59,Man 2: Sain! Hold your tongue!
60,"Sain: Ah, Kent! My boon companion! Why so severe an expression?"
61,"Kent: If your manner were more serious, I wouldn't have to be so severe! We still have a mission to complete, Sain!"
62,Sain: I know that. But how could I remain silent in the presence of such beauty? It would have been discourteous!
63,Kent: What do you know of courtesy!?
64,Lyn: Excuse me! You're blocking the road. If you would be so kind as to move your horses...
65,Kent: Of course. My apologies...
66,"Lyn: Thank you. You, at least, seem honorable enough."
67,"Kent: Hm? Pardon me, but... I feel we've met before."
68,Lyn: I beg your pardon?
69,"Sain: Hey! No fair, Kent! I saw her first!"
70,"Lyn: Tsk! It seems there are no decent men among Lycia's knights! Let's go Tactician, I've run out of patience!"
71,"Kent: Wait, please! It's not like that. ... ...Sain, you lout!"
72,Sain: Huh? Not like that? I thought you were...
73,"Kent: I am NOT you! Come, we must follow her. I suspect she might be--"
74,Sain: Be what? She's our mission? You're joking! Wait!
75,Lyn: Run!!! We're being pursued! Could it be those knights from town? No... It's not them. These men are out for blood!
76,Lyn: ... ...
77,"Zugu: Heh heh hehhh... Aren't you the pretty one! Your name is Lyndis, is it not?"
78,Lyn: What did you call me? ...Who are you?
79,"Zugu: Such a waste. An absolute waste. The things I'll do for gold... Ah, well. Time to die, darlin'! C'mon out, boys!"
80,Lyn: Oh no! There are more than I can handle... But I'll not give up!
81,??: Hey! There she is!
82,Zugu: Huh?
83,Lyn: What?
84,"Sain: Whew... Finally caught up... Hold! You there! What is your business? Such numbers against a girl? Cowards, every one of you!"
85,Lyn: You! You're from--
86,"Kent: We can discuss that later. It appears these ruffians mean to do you harm. If it's a fight they want, let them look to me!"
87,Sain: Stand back! I'll take care of this!
88,Lyn: No! This is my fight! Stay out of my way!
89,"Sain: Well, I can't just stand here and do nothing..."
90,"Kent: I have a solution. You there, command us. I am Kent, a knight of Lycia. My companion is Sain. We will follow your orders in this battle. Is this acceptable, milady?"
91,"Lyn: Yes, it is. Tactician and I will lead! Let's go!"
92,Sain: You! You are called Tactician? I want to impress my beauteous one! Let me attack first!
93,"Sain: O fair and beauteous one! And... Tactician, is it? Allow me to show you the might of a knight of Lycia! Let me be the first to strike a blow in your honor!"
94,"In-game message: Blue units are allies. Direct them on the field as you did with Lyn before. Be warned: if Lyn is defeated, your journey is over, as is your game. If other blue units are beaten, the game will continue, but fallen companions will be unable to return to battle for the rest of the tutorial. Use caution and good judgement. After all blue units have been moved, it automatically becomes the enemy's turn. To begin with, select Sain. Place the cursor on Sain, and press the A Button."
95,Sain: Direct my arm!
96,Sain: Sain is your faithful servant! Command me!
97,Sain: Attack! Move me to a space next to my foe!
98,Sain: Move me up next to the enemy!
99,Sain: Whoa! I missed!?
100,Kent: Sain! Why aren't you using your sword?
101,"Sain: The lance is more heroic. A knight should look heroic, don't you think?"
102,"Kent: You're hopeless. If you don't take fighting more seriously, you're going to find yourself on the end of a blade!"
103,"Sain: Truth be told, I...forgot to buy a sword."
104,Kent: Forgot? Or were you simply too busy dallying with the ladies?
105,Sain: Don't be so mad! I'll be fine with a lance. I'm that good!
106,"Kent: I'd prefer to rely on your skill, not your empty bragging! Take my spare blade and use it to attack next time!"
107,Sain: Are you sure? My thanks Kent!
108,Kent: You're almost more trouble than you're worth. Almost.
109,Kent: Tactician! Allow me to make up for my companion's blunder. I am at your command!
110,"In-game message: Weapons possess a unique hierarchy. Swords best axes. Axes best lances. Lances best swords. This is called the weapon triangle. Remembering this is of the utmost importance. First, let's illustrate that swords are strong against axes. Select Kent."
111,Kent: Command me to attack!
112,Kent: The enemy wields an axe. Use a sword for my attack!
113,Kent: He's almost defeated. Now let's deliver the final blow!
114,Lyn: I must be next to the enemy!
115,Lyn: I want to fight! I must be closer to my foe!
116,Sain: Tactician! Give me another chance!
117,Sain: Tactician! Let me attack again!
118,"Sain: I failed you once before, but give me another chance... I'll not fail you again!"
119,Sain: I'll show you my worth this time. Let me take up arms once more!
120,Sain: Move next to the enemy and attack!
121,Sain: Axe-wielding foes should be met with swords. Brandish your blade!
122,Sain: Gah!
123,Kent: Sain! Are you all right?
124,"Sain: Yes. Yes, I am. I was able to dodge in time. I can't believe he evaded my sword stroke so easily. This is no jest."
125,"Kent: Look closely. The enemy is hidden in the woods. The branches make it difficult to attack, don't they?"
126,Sain: You're right. I was so focused on attacking... I didn't see.
127,Kent: Your lack of attention may someday cost you your life!
128,"Sain: Fine! I understand already! Let it go, Kent!"
129,"Kent: If you truly understand, then act like it!"
130,Sain: Kent worries too much. ...He's going to grow old before his time.
131,"In-game message: Each type of terrain has unique characteristics. For example, look at woods and plains. Battle an enemy from the woods, and the enemy will probably miss you. However, your attacks will be unimpeded, giving you a distinct advantage. The same is true for foes. If an enemy is in the woods, he is more difficult to hit. Factoring in your terrain benefits and the weapon triangle is vital in combat. The window at the bottom of the screen gives information on the terrain the cursor is placed on. Check to see what terrain type is advantageous by using the cursor. Now, let's put this to the test. Select Kent."
132,Kent: I'm ready for battle. Command me as you will!
133,Kent: Move me next to the enemy.
134,Kent: Let's use my sword to attack!
135,Lyn: It seems like a wise decision to leave that bandit to the knights.
136,"Lyn: For my part, if I'm going to take care of the other foe, I'll need to close the distance between us. The knight said that woods are advantageous, right? In that case..."
137,"Lyn: That looks good. Let's move there, Tactician!"
138,"Lyn: You... Your name is Sain, right?"
139,Sain: Yes! Sain the gallant of Caelin. That's me!
140,Lyn: If you insist... Why have you not healed yourself?
141,Sain: Huh? Hey! I've been injured? What a cad I am! To wrinkle that perfect brow of yours with worry for me...
142,"Lyn: Uh... I was thinking of giving you a vulnerary, but... It looks like you're fine. So, never you mind."
143,"Sain: No, wait! I'll take it! Please! I'll take it!!"
144,"In-game message: To give away an item, use the trade command. Trade can only be used by units that are adjacent to one another. Let's use the trade command right now. Select Sain and move him next to Lyn."
145,Sain: I must use the vulnerary and put my lady's mind at ease! Tactician! Bring me to her!
146,"Sain: I mustn't worry my lady any longer. Come, Tactician! Direct me to her!"
147,Sain: I can't keep such a generous offer waiting! The healing power of love awaits with yon angel! Tactician! Tarry no longer!
148,"Sain: I can't keep such a generous offer waiting! The healing power of love awaits with yon angel! Hurry, Tactician! Hurry!"
149,Sain: Move me next to her! I implore you!
150,Sain: Move me next to her! Heed my wishes!
151,"In-game message: Now select the trade command. Sain's and Lyn's possessions will be displayed together Use the cursor to select a vulnerary from Lyn's items, and give it to Sain. After you finished your trade, press the B Button to end the process. The B Button is the cancel button. It can be used to rescind mistaken commands and other things."
152,In-game message: Place the cursor on Lyn's items. Press right on the + Control Pad.
153,"In-game message: Press up or down on the + Control Pad, and select a vulnerary. Then, press the A Button."
154,In-game message: Press the A Button to accept the vulnerary from Lyn.
155,In-game message: Press the B Button to stop trading.
156,In-game message: Sain can now use Lyn's vulnerary. Select the vulnerary from the items and use it.
157,"In-game message: Furthermore, mounted units have the unique ability to move again. Essentially, this allows cavalry to move the number of spaces left in their movement range if they haven't done so already. However, the attack command, among others, nullifies the move again ability, so be careful. Select Sain and order him to move again."
158,"Sain: Ah, much better! Thanks, Tactician! And you have my gratitude as well, my angel!"
159,Lyn: ...
160,"Sain: Ah, much better! You have my gratitude, young ladies."
161,"In-game message: Mission goals change from chapter to chapter. This chapter's goal is to defeat all enemies. Check the chapter goals in the window to the upper right of the screen. To open the map menu, place the cursor on an unoccupied space and press the A Button. You can confirm the chapter goals here by choosing Status from the menu. The map menu also has the Suspend command. This is useful if you have to stop a chapter midway. Time to continue this chapter! Best of luck!"
162,"Zugu: Accursed knights, always tampering in others' affairs."
163,Zugu: Blast... There was only...supposed to be a lone...girl...
164,"Lyn: That's the last of them! Fantastic work, Tactician!"
165,Lyn: And now for these knights of Lycia. You were going to share your story with me?
166,"Kent: Yes. We have ventured from Caelin, in Lycia, in search of someone."
167,"Lyn: Lycia... That's the country beyond the mountains in the southwest, isn't it?"
168,"Kent: Correct. We've come as messengers to the lady Madelyn, who eloped with a nomad some 19 years ago."
169,Lyn: Madelyn?
170,"Kent: Our lord the marquess of Caelin's only daughter. He was heartbroken his own daughter would abandon him so. Eventually, the marquess simply declared that he had no daughter."
171,"Sain: And then this year, we received a letter from Lady Madelyn. It said that she, her husband, and their daughter were living happily on the Sacae plains. The marquess was ecstatic to learn he had a granddaughter of 18 years. I remember the smile on his face when he announced that he'd suddenly become a grandfather. The grandaughter's name is Lyndis. This was also the name of the marquess's wife, who passed away at an early age."
172,Lyn: Lyndis?
173,"Sain: That she should bear this name thawed the marquess's heart. Now, his only wish is to meet his daughter's family at least once. This is why we're here. We didn't know that Lady Madelyn died a few days after sending her letter... We only learned this shortly after we arrived here in Bulgar."
174,Kent: But we also learned all was not lost. Her daughter yet lives. We heard that she was living alone on the plains... I... I knew it immediately. You are the lady Lyndis.
175,Lyn: Why would you think that...
176,Kent: Your resemblance to your departed mother is remarkable.
177,Lyn: What? Did you know my mother?
178,"Kent: I'm sorry to say I never met her directly, but I saw her portraits in Castle Caelin."
179,"Lyn: To the rest of my tribe, I was always Lyn. But when I was with my parents... When it was just the three of us, I was Lyndis. It's all so strange. I was all alone in the world and now I have a grandfather. Lyndis... I never thought I would hear that name again."
180,Kent: ...
181,"Lyn: Wait! That bandit! He called me Lyndis, too!"
182,Kent: What? How could he have--
183,"Sain: ...He was a henchman of Lord Lundgren, wasn't he?"
184,Lyn: Lundgren? Who's that?
185,Kent: He's the marquess's younger brother. Everyone assumed the lady Madelyn was gone forever. This made Lord Lundgren heir to the marquess's title.
186,"Sain: To be blunt, milady, your existence is an obstacle to your granduncle's ambitions."
187,Lyn: That's-- But I have no interest in inheriting any title!
188,"Sain: Unfortunately, your granduncle is not the sort of man to believe that. I believe the attempts on your life will persist."
189,Lyn: What should I do?
190,Kent: Accompany us to Caelin. Continuing on this way is dangerous.
191,Lyn: I feel I have little choice. I will go with you.
192,"Lyn: Tactician... I'm sorry. This changes everything. What will you do, Tactician? You...want me to decide? Of course, your companionship would do much to ease my journey, but... It's going to be so dangerous."
193,Lyn: You'll come? Are you sure? Thank you! Let me ask once again for your friendship and your aid.

196,"A small altar lies on the outskirts of Bulgar. This ancient temple, sacred to the people of Sacae, has long been known for its powerful bond to the world of spirits. Before starting their journey, our travelers come here to pray for their well-being. At this altar, Lyn's hand is directed to a grand inheritance.
"
197,"Lyn: Tactician, hold a moment, and allow me a short detour. There is a sacred sword enshrined in an altar east of here. The people of Sacae go there to pray for safety at the onset of a long journey."
198,Sain: Oh! How quaint!
199,"Kent: The teachings of Elimine have the most followers in Elibe. It is nice to see that, here at least, the ancient customs are still observed."
200,"Glass: Old man! Stay where you are, and hold your tongue!"
201,"Priest: Threaten me as you will, but I'll not give up the Mani Katti. The Mani Katti is a sacred blade, under divine protection. It cannot be removed from its place of rest!"
202,"Glass: You're a fool, old man. What good's a sword if you don't use it?"
203,Priest: Use it? In combat? Sacrilege!
204,"Glass: Sacrilege? I am Glass! The gods fear my name! My swordplay is peerless! And if I want this sword, then this sword I shall have! Now get out of my way!"
205,Priest: Oof!
206,Glass: This is it! It's more magnificient than I'd imagined! This sword was made for a swordsman of my skill. Hmm? What's this? I can't...draw the sword...from its scabbard?
207,Priest: The spirits of the blade have judged you. You have been found wanting. They have rejected you.
208,"Glass: What? Listen, you senile old fool, if you value your own life, you'll get out of my sight!!!"
209,Glass: Curses! Miserable spirits! I care nothing for you! I'll tear this altar down stone by stone!
210,"Woman: I beg your pardon, milady. Are you headed east? To the altar?"
211,"Lyn: Yes, we are indeed."
212,Woman: Then you must hurry and help the priest there. I saw a band of local ruffians head in there not long ago. They seemed intent on stealing the altar's sacred sword!
213,Lyn: The Mani Katti... They're going to steal it? I cannot allow this to happen!
214,"Woman: You look like a virtous group. Please, help him!"
215,"Sain: Lyndis, what are you planning?"
216,"Kent: If you hope to go to the priest's aid, you'll need to prepare."
217,"Lyn: You're right... Say, Tactician. There are some homes to the south of us. Perhaps we should go there and question the residents."
218,In-game message: The three buildings to the south are homes. You can speak with the people who live there. They sometimes give you combat hints or useful information about the land and its people. It pays to listen!
219,"Lyn: Shall I take the lead? All right. Tell me what you would like me to do, Tactician."
220,"Lyn: I'm going to visit that home, right? Just point me in the right direction!"
221,"Lyn: You want me to visit that home, right? I understand."
222,"Lyn: First, I'm going to visit that home, right? Well, let's go!"
223,"Woman: Say, aren't you the... Oh! You're going to help the priest! Well, perhaps you could benefit from something I saw earlier... The bandits may have the main entrance guarded. However, one of the altar's walls is cracked and in poor repair. You might be able to create another entrance by hitting that section with your weapons. We're all counting on you!"
224,"In-game message: Next, send Sain to visit another home. Start by selecting Sain."
225,"Sain: It's my turn to speak with the locals, is it? That's right!"
226,"Sain: Please, I would like to help out however I can. Tactician, direct me to the next residence!"
227,"Sain: I'm next, am I? Well, I'm ready to go!"
228,Sain: It's my turn next? I'm ready to go?
229,"Sain: It's my turn to speak with the locals, is it? That's right!"
230,"Sain: Please, I would like to help out however I can. Tactician, direct me to the next residence!"
231,"Man: Mountains make it more difficult to be hit, but they're difficult to traverse. If you're riding on horseback, you can't cross them at all. Be careful."
232,"In-game message: Remember, your mounted units possess the ability to move again. After moving, cavalry can move the rest of their movement range, unless they've received attack or staff commands. This also goes for units mounted on pegasi and wyverns. Now, give Sain his orders."
233,"In-game message: Finally, let's send Kent to visit the remaining home. This visit isn't necessary for combat purposes. However, its residents may have useful knowledge. I recommand stopping by. Select Kent."
234,"Kent: I'm next to move, am I not? I await your command."
235,"Kent: Am I not supposed to visit that home? Please, give me your guidance."
236,"Girl: Do you know much about the sword held at the altar? It's called the Mani Katti, blessed by the spirits. According to the priest, the Mani Katti is waiting for its rightful owner to appear. It's so odd, don't you think? The idea that a sword can choose who will wield it?"
237,"In-game message: You should know something about fortresses. Fortresses offer more protection than woods do. Fighting from a space in a fortress is beneficial. Remember, this holds true for friend and foe alike. Keep this in mind before engaging your enemy. Fortresses also allow injured units to regain hit points. Your units automatically regain some HP at the beginning of your turn. The HP you recover in one turn is fairly small. As long as you remain in a fortress, you'll regain HP every turn, so a full recovery is possible. There are other places where units can recover HP, including castle gates, thrones, and areas where bosses are found."
238,"In-game message: This chapter's goal is to seize the throne. The leader of the enemy is on the throne now. Defeat him and have Lyn seize the throne to finish this battle. His name is Glass. He's a sword-bearing mercenary. Think of the weapons triangle... What weapon is able to best a sword? Correct! The lance! Using the right weapon is like a shortcut to victory. To get to the altar, try using the method that you heard earlier. It's up to you, Tactician. Good luck."
239,Glass: Who do you think you are? What chance do you think you have against me?
240,Glass: You... You... Urr...urgh...
241,"In-game message: Sometimes, you'll get items after defeating enemies. A single unit can carry a maximum of five items.You might need to drop some old items to pick up new ones. Bear this in mind. You can see what items your enemies will drop by checking their inventories. Place the cursor on an enemy or ally, then press the R Button to view their personal data. This data screen contains information about the unit you've selected. Press the + Control Pad left and right to change pages and view items. If any of the items are glowing yellow, you will get them if you defeat the unit. Don't forget!"
242,"Priest: Ah, your clothing... Are you of the Lorca tribe?"
243,"Lyn: I'm Lyn, the chieftain's daughter. Are you hurt, sir?"
244,"Priest: Thanks to you, I am unscathed. You have my gratitude."
245,Lyn: And the sword? Is it safe?
246,"Priest: Yes, I have sealed the sword safely away. Until I remove my spell, the sword cannot be drawn. Now, as a token of my gratitude, I shall allow you to lay hands upon the Mani Katti. Touch the blade's pattern, and pray for a safe journey."
247,"Lyn: Oh, thank you so much!"
248,Priest: Hm?
249,Lyn: What? Did--
250,Lyn: The sword... It's...glowing.
251,"Priest: Ah. Hm... It's the power of the spirits. Lyn, they have looked into your soul, and they call out to you."
252,Lyn: What does that mean?
253,Priest: You are its rightful owner. You are to wield the Mani Katti.
254,Lyn: No... I can't... I couldn't...
255,"Priest: It is the sword's wish. If you require proof, draw it from its sheath."
256,Lyn: Um... ...
257,Lyn: It came out...effortlessly.
258,Priest: I never dared to hope that I might meet the wielder of the Mani Katti in my life. I am indeed fortunate to see your sword reach your hands.
259,Lyn: My sword?
260,"Priest: It is time for you to go, Lyn. You face a great many ordeals. Grip this sword, and meet your destiny head-on."
261,"Lyn: Yes... Yes, sir!"
262,Sain: So this is the Mani Katti... A blade with no equal.
263,Lyn: This is all so unbelievable. Perhaps the most famous sword in all of Sacae... in my hand.
264,"Kent: It's not so strange. In fact, many legends tell similar tales... Special blades all over the land call out to their proper owners. And yet, when I saw you draw that blade, Lyndis... I felt something extraordinary. That sword was waiting for you. You were meant to draw it."
265,Lyn: Stop it! I... I'm nothing special!
266,"Sain: Think of it this way: Some weapons feel more comfortable in your hand, right? Well the Mani Katti itself feels very comfortable with you. Does this make it any easier for you to accept? It doesn't appear that either of us can use it."
267,Lyn: It...does feel right in my hand. A blade that only I can wield. That seems reasonable enough. I can understand that. Look at it Tactician. This is the Mani Katti. This is...my sword. I must care for it well.
268,Lundgren: What? Madelyn's daughter is still alive?
269,"Soldier: Uh... Yes, Lord Lundgren. The girl is traveling with Kent and Sain. What are your orders? If we let them be..."
270,Lundgren: Bah! I've heard that northern Bern is full of bandits. She's just a girl. She'll not survive her journey here. I'm more concerned with my older brother. His life must be ended quickly. The poison... There must be no blunders.
271,"Soldier: Yes, m'lord. He suspects nothing and continues to drink it. The marquess's death, no doubt due to ""sudden illness,"" is not far off."
272,Lundgren: Heh heh heh. Soon... Soon Caelin will be mine!
273,"Note: the script is from the Lyn Normal mode.
"
274,"The secrets of her past revealed in the words of two Knights of Lycia. Now, to meet her grandfather, Lyn heads west, to Lycia, and to her destiny. A mountain range separates the Sacae Plains from Bern. There are many bandits lurking here, the cruelest of which are the Taliver. They create havoc on both Sacae and Bern, and their savagery knows no bounds. On her tenth day away from the plains, Lyn witnesses their atrocities herself.
"
275,Lyn: This place... It's...
276,Sain: The entire area is in ruins. Why doesn't their marquess do anything to help?
277,"Lyn: Taliver Mountain is home to a gang of vicious, ruthless bandits. No marquess holds power here. My village was near here, on the other side of the mountain. My people were... The Taliver bandits came at night. It took only one night. The survivors numbered less than ten, including me. They're soulless beasts. I will never forgive them. Never."
278,Sain: Lyndis...
279,Kent: ...
280,Lyn: I am not running away. I will be back...someday. I'll be stronger... I will break their swords beneath me like twigs beneath a stallion's hooves. I will avenge my people. I'll do everything in my power.
281,"Sain: When the time comes, bring me with you."
282,Lyn: Sain.
283,"Kent: Don't forget me, either."
284,"Lyn: Kent...Oh! You, too, Tactician? I... You're... Thank you."
285,"Migal: Wait right there, little lady! What are you going to do to apologize? Huh?"
286,"Florina: Uh...I...That is, I..."
287,"Brigand: Hey, she's quite a catch, eh, buddy? I bet the boss'd give us a pretty penny for her."
288,"Migal: Yeah. She roughed me up a bit, so I figure fair's fair. It's no more'n she deserves."
289,Florina: I... I...
290,Brigand: What are we gonna do with her flying mule?
291,Florina: Don't you dare touch her!
292,"Brigand: What? You just watch your mouth, girlie!"
293,"Florina: Do what you will with me, just... Let her go. Please, I beg of you."
294,"Migal: Ha ha ha! Silly twit! Pegasi can only be found in Ilia. They're rare beasts, worth far more than you by far! We can sell it for a mountain of gold. Let it go? HA!"
295,"Florina: No, you can't..."
296,Migal: C'mon! Let's move!
297,"Kent: What's this? Be on your guard, Lyndis. There seems to be some sort of commotion over there."
298,Lyn: That's... That's a pegasus. Could it be?
299,Lyn (far off): Florina?
300,"Lyn: Is that you, Florina?"
301,Florina: Ah! Lyn?
302,Lyn: Florina! What are you doing in a place such as this?
303,Florina: Lyn! Is it really you? I... I...
304,"Lyn: Come now, no crying!"
305,Florina: I'm sorry.
306,Kent: You are acquaintances?
307,"Lyn: She's my friend. This is Florina, a pegasus knight in training from Ilia. She's a little uncomfortable around men. Tell me, Florina, what happened here?"
308,"Florina: Well...um... When I heard that you had left... I decided to follow you. Then I saw this village. I flew down to ask if they had news of you. I didn't see those two, and...well..."
309,Lyn: Did your pegasus land on them?
310,"Florina: Well, I... A little..."
311,"Brigand: Aha! You heard her! She admits her fault! She stepped on my friend, and now she's got to pay!"
312,"Lyn: Did you apologize, Florina?"
313,Florina: Yes. I told them I was sorry many times over. They just wouldn't listen. ...
314,"Lyn: Don't cry, it's alright."
315,Florina: Lyn...
316,"Lyn: Listen, she's obviously sorry. Can't we just let this pass? You don't appear to be injured or anything."
317,Migal: No chance. The girl goes with us—by force if need be!
318,"Migal: Hey! C'mon out now, boys! The men are fair game, but don't put a scratch on the girls!"
319,Lyn: Tactician! We've got to fight back!
320,Florina: Lyn... I...
321,"Lyn: You're a pegasus knight, aren't you? You can fight, can't you?"
322,Florina: ...Yes!
323,"Lyn: Listen carefully, Tactician. We're facing bandits. They're underlings, but we can't take them too lightly. Let's clear them out of here. Are you ready?"
324,"Lyn: The layout around here might make it difficult to fight. The same holds true for our foe, too. If we use these walls just so, they may ensure our victory."
325,Florina: Lyn... Who's that?
326,"Lyn: This is Tactician. He/She's still an apprentice, but he/she's my tactician."
327,"Florina: Oh, I see... Uh, Tactician? I'm pleased to meet you."
328,"Florina: Oh, I see... Well, Tactician... I'm pleased to meet you."
329,"In-game message: The red-roofed buildings are villages. Villages are in danger of being attacked. If an enemy unit reaches a village before one of our units does, the village will be destroyed. As quickly as possible, visit the residents and give them warning. Only good can come of it. So, let's visit them. Please select Lyn."
330,Lyn: You want me to visit a village? Just give me the order.
331,"Lyn: I'm to visit a village, right? Then issue the command."
332,"Lyn: You'd like me to visit a village, right? Just give the order!"
333,Lyn: Is anyone there?
334,"Villager (far off): Leave us alone, you thugs!"
335,Other villager (far off): Go away! Go away! We've no more gold for you!
336,"Lyn: No, wait! Please! We're not bandits! We want to help the village. Please listen!"
337,"??: Remain inside, everyone. I'll go see what's happening."
338,"Wil: Not bandits, huh? So, who are you?"
339,"Lyn: My name is Lyn. My colleagues and I are just traveling through here. We saw some bandits about. We're going to deal with them, but... We need you to go and warn the villagers."
340,"Wil: Hey! Wait! The name's Wil. I'm a traveler of sorts, too. Listen, these villagers have been kind to me. Mind if I fight with you?"
341,"Lyn: Not at all. We need all the help we can get! Welcome aboard, Wil!"
342,"In-game message: By visiting a village, we gained a new companion. Wil is an archer. He uses a bow to fight. Bows can be fired at foes more than 1 space away. Obstacles won't affect your line of fire. Attacking enemies without moving next to them is called indirect combat. If the enemy has no weapons capable of indirect combat, there's no fear of counterattack, and that's to our benefit. However, you cannot fire on adjacent spaces. If someone moves next to you and attacks, that's it. Units with bows are best suited to lend assistance from the rear. Let's try some indirect combat, shall we? Select Wil."
343,"Wil: So, you are Mark Tactician? I am Wil, master marksman. No, the pleasure is mine! It looks like there are bandits on the other side of that wall. To the east is another archer. So let's go to that thug to the north. He's all mine! Say the word, Tactician!"
344,"Wil: Hey! It's me! Wil, remember? Why don't you issue me a command? I'd love to help!"
345,Wil: Let's take out the bandit on the north side of the wall! Direct me that way!
346,"In-game message: Next is Florina, a pegasus knight. As you might guess, pegasus knights have the ability to fly. They can move over almost any terrain type. This small wall would stop most units, but it poses no problem for a pegasus knight. Select Florina."
347,"Florina: So...it's my turn now? I expect you'll want me to attack that...man...over there. Well...give me the...order, please."
348,"Florina: To the north... On the other side of the wall. I'm to attack the other guy over there, right? Please give me the order to attack, and I shall do so."
349,Florina: I... I am ready to fight. I'll follow your orders...
350,"Florina: I won't give up! Please, you must let me join the fight!"
351,"Florina: Excuse me... I hate to be a bother, but... If I'm to attack, I'll need to be right next to the enemy. ...I'll shut up now."
352,Florina: Begging your pardon... I have to be next to an enemy to attack. Please give me the chance to attack.
353,"In-game message: Knowing your units and their abilities and knowing how to use them in battle is a shortcut to victory. To learn everything about a unit, place the cursor on that unit and press the R Button."
354,Florina: Lyn! What should I do? There's an archer!!!
355,"Lyn: What? Where!? Oh, that's Wil."
356,Wil: Hi! You're one of Lyn's friends?
357,Florina: Um... ... ...
358,Wil: What... What is it? Are you unwell?
359,"Lyn: I'm sorry, Wil. Her name is Florina. She's timid around men, and you...you've got a bow."
360,"Wil: Oh! I see! You must be a pegasus knight! I apologize for frightening you, but I do understand your fear of bows."
361,Florina: I...um... ...I'm sorry... Even looking...at a...bow...frightens me ever so much...
362,"Wil: Of course, I understand. But you should really only fear the enemy's archers, not your own."
363,Florina: Yes...Of course...
364,"In-game message: Units that fly, like pegasus knights, are very vulnerable to bow attacks. Arrows will deal critical damage to them. If the enemy has bow-wielding units, you must be extremely cautious."
365,"Girl: You came to help the village? That's good. With so many bandits, I wasn't sure what to do. It's not much, but please, take this money. There is an armory to the southeast of us. Equip yourself as you see fit, and help us, please."
366,"In-game message: Weapons have the strength to be used only a limited number of times. As you fight, their endurance drops. At zero, the weapon breaks and disappears from your inventory. Check your weapon endurance by placing the cursor on a unit and pressing the R Button. You can also check on the item screen. The number next to the weapon is its endurance. Be careful. Without a weapon a unit cannot enter combat."
367,"Lyn: Hey, listen! There's something I wanted to ask you."
368,"Migal: Begging for your life so soon, wench?"
369,Lyn: Are you...Taliver bandits?
370,"Migal: Taliver? Those greedy monsters? We're nothing like them!! Those fiends will even kill women and children! We're from Ganelon, and we know a little something of honor. We don't harm women, for one thing. Heh heh heh. After all, why kill what you can sell?"
371,"Lyn: If you're not Taliver, then there's no reason for you to die here today. If you would like to tuck your tails and flee, do so now."
372,Migal: You... You... No more courtesies! You're going to learn to watch your tongue!!!
373,Florina: Um... Excuse me...
374,"Migal: Uh? It's you! So, you changed your mind about joining us, eh?"
375,"Florina: Well...no... But...this really is...my fault... Really... So, can we..."
376,"Migal: What?! C'mon, lass, out with it!"
377,Florina: I'm sorry. Can we... Can we just stop fighting now?
378,Migal: You've got to be kidding. After I've been made to look like a fool? No way!
379,Florina: Eeek!
380,"Migal: You're coming with us! I promise you that!! Now, if you don't want to get hurt, give yourself up!"
381,Migal: Draw your swords! We're not listening to any of your stinking apologies!
382,Migal: Ugh... You'll live to regret this... My brothers... The Ganelon bandits will not let this stand...
383,Lyn: That's finally taken care of.
384,Florina: Lyn!
385,Lyn: Florina... Why did you follow me? It's so dangerous.
386,Florina: Do you remember the knighting ceremony of the Pegasus Knights of Ilia?
387,"Lyn: Yes, you join a band of freelance soldiers to further your training. Is that what brought you here, Florina?"
388,"Florina: Uh-huh. I wanted to talk to you before I set out. But when I went to Sacae, I heard you had left with some strangers, and..."
389,"Lyn: You were worried for me? Thank you, but I'm more worried about you."
390,Florina: Me?
391,"Lyn: Listen, most mercenaries are men, right? Bands of men? I can't imagine you being at all comfortable around them."
392,"Florina: I know, I know. It's just... I've always dreamt of being a pegasus knight. I imagined I would just...work it out. Somehow. After today, I'm not so sure. Maybe I should just...give up..."
393,"Lyn: Florina, don't cry..."
394,"Sain (far off): Yes, there's no reason to give up your dream!"
395,Lyn: Hm?
396,Sain: Lovely Florina! I have the most brillant idea!
397,Kent: Sain!
398,"Sain: You should come with us! With the addition of Wil here, we're a fine group of soldiers, and freelance to boot!"
399,"Wil: Wait, did you just include me?"
400,"Sain: Of course! We were destined to meet here! It's fate! Come now, Lyndis's band of mercenaries is as good a training group as you'll find anywhere!"
401,Kent: Sain... This is no joking matter!
402,"Florina: Lyndis? Um, Lyn? Mercenaries?"
403,"Lyn: I can give you details later. This is all a bit rushed. However, Sain is right. Will you come with us, Florina?"
404,"Florina: Travel with you, Lyn? Truly? I would be so...so happy!"
405,Sain: Fantastic! Beauteous Florina! I am a knight of Caelin. My name is Sain...
406,Florina: Eeek! Stay back! Don't get so close.
407,"Sain: Ah... Beautiful, and yet so modest!"
408,Kent: I beg your forgiveness. Calling us mercenaries...
409,"Lyn: No, I approve. We can't leave Florina on her own. She requires special attention though. Can I count on you?"
410,Kent: Yes! You have but to ask.
411,Wil: So... Is it really all right if I travel with you?
412,"Lyn: Oh, yes. Of course! If you're willing, Wil."
413,"Wil: Actually, I'm very grateful. Truth be told, all of my money was stolen, and I'm...at a bit of a crossroads. I would be honored to count myself one of Lyndis's Legion!"
414,"Lyn: ""Lyndis's Legion""? This is getting stranger with every day, Tactician."
415,"Note: The script is from the Lyn Normal mode.
"
416,"After defeating the bandits, Lyn continues westward. She and her colleagues stop for the night at a ruined fortress. The Ganelon bandits are in a rage after their brethren fell to Lyn's sword. They race in pursuit of the companions. Their angry footsteps sound closer and closer...
"
417,"Wil: Ah, this should suffice! Tonight's bed!"
418,"Sain: This mildewy old fortress? Is this the best we can do? Come, Wil! Surely you jest!"
419,Wil: The bandits keep everything in turmoil around here. No one has the time to worry about travelers. And there are rather a lot of us.
420,"Lyn: This will be fine. Who wants to be stuck inside, anyway? I prefer a place where I can feel the wind blow."
421,"Florina: As long as I'm at Lyn's side, I'll be fine."
422,"Sain: And for your protection, your man-at-arms Sain will be right here by your side, ladies."
423,"Kent: Sain, both you and I are to remain awake. We will alternate the watch."
424,"Sain: Ah, alas..."
425,"Natalie (far off): Your pardon, milady..."
426,Lyn: Who's there?
427,Natalie: I... Forgive my intrusion... My name's Natalie. I'm from a village not far from here... Ah! Ow...
428,Lyn: Are you all right? Hm? Your leg...
429,"Natalie: It's fine. Don't worry. It's from a childhood sickness... I can't travel far on it, but it doesn't trouble me much."
430,Lyn: What are you doing here all by yourself?
431,"Natalie: I'm looking for my husband... I heard he was in this area. He said he was going to raise money to have my leg mended. He left the village and hasn't returned. He's a kindhearted man, but I think he might be involved in something dangerous. I got so worried... Here's a sketch of him. It's a poor likeness at best, but... His name is Dorcas. Do you know of him?"
432,"Lyn: I'm sorry, I don't believe I've seen or heard of him."
433,"Natalie: I see. If you do meet him, please give him a message. Tell him Natalie is looking for him."
434,"Lyn: I will tell him, I promise."
435,Carjiga: Here they are. We've finally tracked down the band that defeated Migal.
436,"Brigand: So they've decided to hole up in this ruined fortress. Perfect. We'll wait 'til it gets dark, and then..."
437,"Carjiga: You're an idiot! There are only a few of them, and some are women! If we attacked them at night, I'd be a laughingstock! Besides, we might hurt the women by mistake! I will not be so wasteful!"
438,"Brigand: You're right, Carjiga! You're so smart!"
439,"Carjiga: We'll avenge Migal, and get some pretty souveniers to boot. Who knows, maybe I'll be a leader after all. Ha ha ha! Let's go! Spread out and encircle the place, you rogues! Let's finish this before it gets too dark to see!"
440,"Carjiga: Hey you! Your name's...Dorcas, right?"
441,Dorcas: ...
442,"Carjiga: You haven't done much since you joined us. If those weapons of yours aren't just for show, today's the day to let us see what you can do."
443,Dorcas: ...
444,"Carjiga: I want you to attack from the back entrance to the east. There's supposed to be a woman inside. I want you to capture her. Do that, and I'll increase your share of the take. If you want gold, you'll get the job done."
445,"Dorcas: A bunch of women, huh? It would break Natalie's sweet heart to see me sink so low."
446,Kent: Lady Lyndis! Outside the fortress! Bandits!
447,Lyn: What did you say?
448,"Sain: Persistent bunch, aren't they? What do you think? Shall we go out and face them?"
449,"Lyn: No... Natalie cannot move well, and that would put her in danger. Let them come to us. We'll fight here, within these walls. Tactician, take over. The command is yours. All we have to do is hold out until they tire and leave."
450,Natalie: Oh...
451,"Lyn: Rest easy, Natalie. No one will harm you! Listen everyone! Fight with caution!"
452,"In-game message: In this chapter, your goal is to protect a special character for a set period of time. Keep Natalie safe for 7 turns. Tactician, Natalie, and other green units are called NPCs. NPCs are not enemies, but they cannot be moved or given orders. Sometimes, green units will be attacked because they are on the field of combat. Be careful not to let enemies close in on Natalie."
453,"Lyn: Tactician! This fortress has two entrances. That's where we must meet the enemy! I'll take the eastern door. Tactician, you and the others. guard the main entrance."
454,"In-game message: When the enemy far outnumbers your group, it's safer to restrict the battle to smaller areas. No matter how strong an enemy is, if he's attacked on all sides, he's sure to take massive damage. So, the east door is Lyn's, and the south door is everyone else's. Be on guard. Select Lyn, move her to the space indicated by the cursor, and have her wait."
455,Lyn: You must move me first. I need to get to the east door!
456,Lyn: The entrance to the east...  I need to guard it and protect our rear!
457,Lyn: Tactician! The fighter who just attacked me... Doesn't he look somewhat like that picture of Natalie's husband?
458,"In-game message: Sometimes, you can speak with enemy characters. If you think you can converse with someone, move one of your units to an adjacent space. By and large, you'll know whom to send from hints you receive in other conversations. When you're not sure, just try using Lyn. Select Lyn now."
459,Lyn: I need to talk with that man. Bring me to him.
460,"Lyn: Please, Tactician. I need to talk to that man!"
461,"Lyn: You! Tell me, are you Dorcas?"
462,Dorcas: ..... How do you know my name?
463,Lyn: Natalie told me. What are you doing with these rogues?
464,Dorcas: I need money...
465,"Lyn: That may be, but...joining up with mercenaries?"
466,Dorcas: It's the only way to earn gold in these parts. I'll do anything...even this.
467,Lyn: For gold? Anything? Would you hurt your wife? Natalie is here! We're protecting her within this fortress!!
468,Dorcas: What!? Natalie's... She's here?
469,"Lyn: She was so worried that she came looking for you. Think, Dorcas! Would your actions please your wife?"
470,Dorcas: ..... ...You're right.
471,Lyn: Well?
472,Dorcas: I understand. I can't do this. I'm done with these bandits. Here and now.
473,Lyn: Really?
474,Dorcas: Yes... And I would repay you for your kindness toward Natalie. Allow me to fight for you.
475,"In-game message: In this way, you can sometimes turn enemies into allies. Never underestimate the persuasive power of speech. Your new companion, Dorcas, is an axe-wielding fighter. Do you remember the weapon triangle? Axes are strong against lances and weak against swords. Axes have more power than other weapons, but they are also more difficult to hit with. Try using Dorcas to attack. Select Dorcas now."
476,Dorcas: So you're their tactician... I'll use my axes and fight alongside you. Direct me as you will.
477,"In-game message: The weapon Dorcas is using is called a handaxe. Use it to attack an adjacent opponent, or throw it in indirect combat in the manner of a bow. This versatility makes it a valuable weapon."
478,"In-game message: Right now, after all of your units have moved, it automatically becomes the enemy's turn, right? Sometimes, there are moments when you might not want or be able to move all of your units. When it's bothersome to tell your units to wait one by one, select end from the map menu to speed things up. To display the map menu, place the cursor on an unoccupied space and press the A Button."
479,Carjiga: What are you waiting for? She's just a child! A girl! Grrr! Get more men up here now!!
480,Dorcas: Natalie!
481,Natalie: Is it you?
482,"Dorcas: Natalie! Are you all right? What were you thinking, coming out all this way?"
483,"Natalie: I was worried about you. Please, don't let my leg trouble you anymore. You mustn't put yourself in such danger. Please!"
484,Dorcas: I'm sorry. I must have been out of my head. I didn't realize... That girl Lyn made me open my eyes.
485,Natalie: Lyndis brought you here?
486,"Dorcas: I'll explain later. We've got to drive back these bandits first. Listen, stay put. Don't move from here."
487,"Natalie: All right. As long as you're here, I know I'm safe."
488,Natalie: Ah...
489,Lyn: Natalie!
490,Lyn: I wasn't strong enough... ...I couldn't protect Natalie. I'm sorry Tactician... I need to be alone. ...I... I failed her when she needed help most.
491,Carjiga: Urgh! How? How are they so tough? You! Bring me more men here right away!
492,Carjiga: Arrgh.. This isn't... Not me...
493,"Brigand (or Carjiga if he's not killed): Curses! They're not human! Listen up, rogues! Retreat! Pull back!"
494,Lyn: The enemy's fled... Tactician! We've won!!!
495,Natalie: Dorcas!
496,"Dorcas: I'm so sorry, Natalie."
497,"Lyn: All's well that ends well. Right, Natalie?"
498,Dorcas: Our village is close. I'll take Natalie home and return tomorrow.
499,Lyn: Hm? Why can't we just say our farewells today?
500,"Dorcas: Well, I... I spoke with Tactician. I... I've been invited to join your group."
501,Lyn: But we're going to Lycia.
502,"Dorcas: I have to go somewhere to earn money. If you think I'll be of use, I'd like to fight for you. You helped my wife... I owe you."
503,Lyn: Dorcas...
504,"Natalie: Please, Lyn. We are both in agreement on this. Watch over my husband."
505,Lyn: Things have finally calmed down.
506,Kent: We shall take turns keeping watch. Please rest easily.
507,Lyn: Is that all right? Are you sure? Sain!
508,Sain: Ye-Yes! Of course!
509,"Lyn: Let me warn you... If bandits sneak up on you, they will cut you down without mercy. Do you understand that?"
510,"Sain: What are you saying? Am I not a knight? There's no need to worry so! Right, Kent?"
511,"Kent: If there's anything suspicious, I will take care of it. Please be assured."
512,"Lyn: Really? Well, goodnight then. See you tomorrow, Tactician."
513,Kent: Let's go.
514,Sain: Ha ha... No one trusts me...
515,"The next morning comes too quickly. Lyn has fought back the bandits’ attack. Now, she rushes for the border of Bern. If she can reach it, Lycia itself is not far off. For a moment, Lyn stops to imagine the face of a grandfather she’s never seen.
"
516,"Lyn talks to Serra
"
517,Kent: We’ve almost reached the Lycian border.
518,"Lyn: Once we cross, we’ll be safe from the bandits, right?"
519,Wil: We should be. I doubt they’ll be willing to pursue us across the border.
520,"Sain: Lycia at last! It’s been a long time. Tomorrow, we’ll dine on a feast of Lycia’s finest foods! And the mistress of the inn at the crossing is said to be a beauty. Ah, yes… Food and love. No better way to restore a man’s soul! This is going to be a fine evening, eh, Kent?"
521,"Kent: If your behavior is as deplorable as ever, we’d best stay elsewhere. We’re not here for sightseeing!"
522,"Sain: Oh, come now! That’s not fair!"
523,"Lyn: Kent, the inn will be fine."
524,"Kent: As you say, milady."
525,Sain: Lyndis! You are truly an angel from on high!
526,Lyn: It’s nothing. Forget it.
527,Florina: Ah! We’ll finally be able to get a good night’s sleep.
528,"Lyn: Oh, no… Those bandits are persistent, I’ll give them that much."
529,Bug: Ah! Here they are! I’ve found ’em!!
530,Wil: What? Not again! They’re still after us?
531,Bug: Heh heh heh. Don’t think you’re getting away so easily!
532,"Bandit: You leave alive, and everyone’ll think the Ganelon Bandits have gone soft!"
533,"Lyn: So? We care nothing for you or your reputations! We must get to Lycia! Get in our way, and you’ll pay!"
534,"Bug: Cheeky little thing, aren’t you? Let’s get ’em, lads! And no holding back just ’cause there’s women with ’em! Wipe ’em out!"
535,Serra: Oooh… We’re lost. This makes me so mad!
536,Erk: You told me you were certain this was the correct path.
537,"Serra: What’s your point, Erk? What are you trying to say?"
538,"Erk: …I swear, you are NOT the woman I agreed to escort…"
539,Serra: What? What’s that supposed to mean?
540,Erk: I heard someone was needed to escort a frail Lycian priestess to Ostia…
541,"Serra: Yes, and I’m that priestess."
542,"Erk: Frail? You? Serra, you have no need of any escort to protect you. Even the most hardened criminal would flee in terror after five minutes in your company. I’ll return your money. Gladly. Now, will you please go on to Ostia alone?"
543,"Serra: NO! You’re MY escort, Erk! MINE! You’re so clean and tidy. A noblewoman like myself can’t be seen without a proper escort. Your personality’s nothing special, but you’re not bad to look at."
544,Erk: I believe that’s my line. And I have to take you all the way to Ostia? I only hope my nerves can endure the journey.
545,Serra: What are you mumbling about? You’re so gloomy! Hm? Something’s happening over there. Let’s take a look!
546,"Erk: Ah. Of course. The first opportunity to get involved in trouble, and she jumps right in. No amount of money is worth this. Hoo…"
547,Serra: Wow! A fight! A fight! Erk! Take a look! Fighting those bandits… It’s a young girl!
548,Erk: Fool! Keep your voice down!
549,Bandit: Eh? What’s this? You in league with that she-devil?
550,Serra: Hm?
551,Erk: Ah… This is so wrong…
552,Bandit: Gyaaa! I’ll take care of you with one swift stroke!
553,Serra: Eeeeeek! Eeeeeek! Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Erk! Help me!!!
554,Erk: So…loud… Serra! Behind me! You there! See if you can match me! (Bandit Archer attacks Erk)
555,"Lyn: That scream… Look! Tactician, someone’s over there!"
556,"In-game message: Sometimes, you can talk to different NPCs (the green units on the map). The process is the same as talking to enemies. Give it a try. Please select Lyn."
557,Lyn: You want me to talk to that person? Understood.
558,"Lyn: I’m supposed to talk to that person, right? Give the order."
559,"Lyn: Um, excuse me… Hello?"
560,Serra: Hm?
561,Lyn: Why are you fighting these bandits?
562,Erk: … It just happened.
563,"Serra: That’s not true! Those ruffians thought that we were with you!!! You got us into a terrible situation! Now, how are you going to get us out?"
564,"Erk: Serra, if you’d not been so meddlesome, this all could have been avoided. My apologies. Please trouble yourself with us no more."
565,"Lyn: But…if you’re going to have to fight anyway, shouldn’t we team up? It will end things faster, right?"
566,Serra: That’s true. Yes! That’s a good idea. Erk! Go and help these ladies.
567,Erk: But I… Fine!
568,"Lyn: Very good. My name’s Lyn. SO tell me, will you join arms with us?"
569,"Serra: Yes, we’d be glad to. My name is Serra. This is my escort, Erk. Be a good boy, and go fight now, Erk."
570,Erk: …Sigh…
571,"In-game message: Erk, a mage, and Serra, a cleric, have joined your group. Mages use the magic of truth to attack and damage their enemies. Clerics use staves to restore HP to their allies. Let’s try them both. First, select Serra."
572,"Serra: Hello. You’re Tactician, right? I’m Serra. Nice to meet you. By the way, see this contrary mage here with me? His name is Erk. I think he’s been hurt. I am Erk’s employer. “Master,” I suppose you could say. What I’m getting at is… I was thinking of healing him free of charge. I know, I know. I’m generous to a fault. Hm? Why are you looking at me like that? Praise my generosity! Anyway, that’s the deal. Please direct me to him."
573,Serra: Please direct me.
574,"In-game message: Press the A button, and select the staff from the menu."
575,Serra: I’m going to use my staff. Watch in wonder!
576,Serra: My staff! Let me use my staff!
577,"In-game message: Clerics cannot wield weapons; therefore they can’t engage in combat. However, they can use their staves to restore HP to allied units. Besides healing staves, which restore HP, there are other staves with different abilities. It’s always a good idea to test out any new abilities you receive, so let’s do that now. Have Erk demonstrate his magic. Begin by selecting Erk."
578,"Erk: You are Tactician? I am Erk. I’m not sure how I got in this mess. If I’m going to fight, however, I will show you the true power of magic!"
579,Erk: I will show you the true power of magic!
580,"In-game message: Magic, like Dorcas’s throwing axes, can strike enemies in adjacent squares as well as those at a distance. It’s very useful. Magic can penetrate even the strongest defenses, so it can be used in many situations. However, mages have few HP and low defensive abilities. To avoid counter-attacks, move in close to archers, and attack other fighters from 1 space away. Try and formulate combat strategies like this to be successful on the field of combat."
581,"Old man: Magic can be used to attack enemies both near and far. Plus, you might find that magic can hit an enemy that normal weapons do not harm. However… Mages are notoriously susceptible to physical attacks. Just because they’re versatile doesn’t mean you should put them in harm’s way. It does you no good if they are lost because of your carelessness."
582,"Man: Tell me, are you using the R Button? If there’s something you don’t understand, use the R Button to investigate. It’s essential. Place the cursor on a unit and press the R Button. This displays detailed information on the unit. You knew that, right? While that information is displayed, press the R Button again. That will get you even more detailed information. Did you know that? The R Button can be used in many other places, too. Anyway, when you come across something unfamiliar, try pressing the R Button! Won’t hurt to remember that! (House near the armory) Ah, so you’re a traveler? Listen to my advice: handle your money wisely. If you spend too much too soon, you’ll run out early and suffer later. There are other shops, so save about, oh, half of your money."
583,Bug: You’re gonna learn why people fear the Ganelon Bandits!
584,Bug: Blaaaaah… Scum… You’re all scum…
585,"Lyn: Nicely done, Tactician. That should just about do it."
586,"Serra: What a surprise. You are very strong, Lyn."
587,Lyn: Your staff is a wondrous thing. Healing powers amaze me.
588,Serra: Only those in the service of good can wield them.
589,"Lyn:You helped us tremendously. Well, it’s time for us to go."
590,"Serra: Take care. Good-bye, Lyn."
591,"Lyn: Fare you well. You, too, Erk."
592,Erk: Good-bye.
593,"Serra: Well, let us be on our way, Erk."
594,Sain (Off-screen): What have we here? Another wildflower? Perhaps a butterfly?
595,Sain: What an absolutely delectable creature!
596,Serra: Oh my! Are you one of Lyn’s companions?
597,"Sain: Please, call me Sain."
598,Serra: I’m Serra. I serve House Ostia.
599,Sain: Serra… What a lyrical name. I am in service to Castle Caelin.
600,Serra: Oh! So is Lyn a member of the marquess’s family?
601,"Sain: She is the granddaughter of our lord, the marquess."
602,Serra: Hmmm… Such an important person.
603,Erk: Serra…what deviousness are you contemplating now?
604,Serra: Tee hee! Having a person of power in your debt is never a bad thing!
605,Erk: You can’t be serious…
606,"Serra: Oh, Sain! Do you think we could join the lady Lyndis’s company? She seems like such a nice person, and I would ever so much like to help her."
607,"Sain: Of course! We couldn’t be happier!! Why, we were only just saying how we need some more fighting power!"
608,Serra: Are you being hunted or something?
609,"Sain: Yes, it’s an inheritance dispute. Assassins everywhere."
610,"Serra: Oh my! In that case, my healing staff and Erk’s magic should come in handy."
611,"Erk: Well, I, er… It sounds…dangerous…"
612,Sain: Your staff and magic would be extremely helpful! Please wait here! I will go and speak with Lady Lyndis on your behalf.
613,Erk: Unbelievable…
614,"Serra: This is fantastic, Erk! Our good deeds will earn us gratitude beyond imagining!"
615,Erk: I… I… I think I’m going to be ill.
616,Lundgren: That little girl crossed the border!?
617,"Soldier: Yes, Lord Lundgren. She’s en route to Araphen…"
618,"Lundgren: Fool! Send out soldiers to meet her! Hold nothing back! Do anything to finish this now! First the old man, and now the girl… They cling to life like a drowning man to a rock! Double the poison’s strength! If he struggles, hold him down and pour it down his throat! Once the girl is gone, Caelin is mine. I will let no one stand in my way!"
619,"Note: the script is from the Lyn Normal mode.
"
620,"At long last, Lyn arrives in the land of her mother's birth. Lycia is a federation of territories, each one ruled by a powerful marquess. Now, Lyn takes her leave of one of these territories, Araphen and sets out to meet her grandfather, the marquess of Caelin. However, the marquess's brother, Lundgren, hungers to rule over Caelin. He is preparing a deadly welcome for Lyn, who stands to threaten his grasp for power.
"
621,"Lyn: What city is this?
"
622,"Sain: This? This is Araphen. After Ostia, it's the second-biggest city in Lycia.
"
623,"Lyn: The second biggest, hm? It does seem awfully busy. By the way, where's Kent?
"
624,"Sain: He said he was going ahead to the castle, but... Ah, here he comes now.
"
625,"Kent: Milady Lyndis! Let us proceed to the castle. They've prepared supplies for us. The marquess has agreed to aid us on our journey Caelin.
"
626,"Lyn: He's going to help us?
"
627,"Kent: Yes. Araphen and Caelin have enjoyed a sturdy friendship for many years. Once I informed the marquess of our plight, he agreed to lend us his strength.
"
628,"Sain: Looks like we've got a smooth road ahead!
"
629,"Kent: If we could pick up some soldiers, the road to Caelin would be that much safer. I'm truly sorry for hardships you've suffered so far.
"
630,"Lyn: Don't be silly. You are so capable, Kent.
"
631,"Sain: Kent!?
"
632,"Lyn: Hm? Oh, and so are you, Sain.
"
633,"Sain: Of course I am!
"
634,"Kent: The castle awaits...
"
635,"Man: This is terrible! The castle is burning!!
"
636,"Sain: What did you say? What's happening?
"
637,"Man: Smoke! From the castle! Hey! What are those men doing?
"
638,"Lyn: Who are you?
"
639,"Man: You! You're Lyndis, aren't you?
"
640,"Lyn: Ah!
"
641,"Lyn: What do you—Assassin: No questions! Prepare yourself!!!
"
642,"Lyn: Hey!
"
643,"Assassin: Aaaargg! Aaaaah!!
"
644,"Lyn: What? An arrow?
"
645,"Rider: ......
"
646,"Lyn: Who are--
"
647,"Kent: Milady Lyndis!
"
648,"Kent: Are you all right?
"
649,"Lyn: I'm fine. He... This man saved me.
"
650,"Kent: May I ask your name?
"
651,"Rider: ......
"
652,"Lyn: Wait! Why did you help me?
"
653,"Rider: I thought a Sacaean plainswoman was being attacked. I was mistaken.
"
654,"Lyn: No, you were right! I am from Sacae. I'm Lyn, the daughter of the Lorca chieftain.
"
655,"Rider: The Lorca? There were survivors?
"
656,"Lyn: Yes.
"
657,"Rider: You should leave at once. A blaze has started in the castle, and it's spreading. Don't be foolish and waste the life I just saved.
"
658,"Lyn: You're from the castle? What's happening? How severe is the fire? Is the marquess safe?
"
659,"Rider: The castle is under attack, and the marquess has been accosted. The man who attacked you was probably one of the marauders. As captain of the castle guard, it's my duty to rescue the marquess.
"
660,"Lyn: I see... All right then we'll help you.
"
661,"Kent: Milady?
"
662,"Rider: Why?
"
663,"Lyn: These brigands are after me. If they're attacking the castle, it's because of me. So I must help if I can...
"
664,"Rider: It sounds like you're involved somehow... Let's go.
"
665,"Lyn: You'll accept our aid?
"
666,"Kent: .......
"
667,"Rider: I am Rath of the Kutolah. Our tribes may be different, but I will not abandon a woman of the Sacae.
"
668,"Lyn: Thank you, Rath! A thousand blessings upon you!
"
669,"Rath: And a thousand curses upon our enemy!
"
670,"Lyn: Come!
"
671,"Woman: You! What are you doing in my house?!
"
672,"Mysterious Man: Peace! I mean no danger to you! Your home offers a good view of the battle outside. Look, I'll pay you for the privilege. Please.
"
673,"Woman: Like a vulture waiting for the spoils, eh? Terrible! Pay up! I'll be hiding below, so don't bother me.
"
674,"Mysterious Man: I wouldn't dream of it.
"
675,"Mysterious Man: Now then, which side has the most to offer?
"
676,"Rath: Once the marquess is safe, my men can move in. Perhaps the secret passageway...
"
677,"Lyn: Secret passageway?
"
678,"Rath: An underground tunnel leading to the throne room. There are triggers in the barracks that will open the tunnel.
"
679,"Lyn: Head through the passage to the throne room...and rescue the marquess. Once that's done, can you drive the enemy from the castle?
"
680,"Rath: Mmm... If we can release those triggers, my men and I can handle the rest. There are three triggers, though. All three need to be released, or the entrance won't open.
"
681,"Lyn: But the doors to the barracks are locked.
"
682,"Rath: The enemy's within. If we don't get inside and finish them, we're stuck.
"
683,"Lyn: So opening those doors is our first objective.
"
684,"Tutorial box: The goal of this chapter is to open the doors and reach the 3 triggers located inside. To open doors, you need door keys or the services of a thief.
"
685,"Lyn: What shall we do, Mark? We don't have any keys with us. Perhaps some of the marauders are carrying keys...
"
686,"Tutorial box: There may be times when you are unsure how to proceed. Start by checking Status on the Map Menu. Visiting homes or villages is also a good way to get information. Who knows what hints you might find. Let's try visiting a house. Please select Lyn.
"
687,"Note: the script is from the Lyn Normal mode.
"
688,"Lyn takes her leave of Araphen, finding no aid from its spiteful marquess. Now, she and her companions resume their march toward Caelin in earnest. Racing against time, with her grandfather's life the prize. Harried and impatient, Lyn presses onward. Suddenly a young boy appears and pleads for their assistance.

"
690,"Nils: Please! Somebody... Somebody, please help!"
691,Innkeeper: That's enough! Get out now! I want none of your trouble!
692,"Nils: But, sir... Why? You were so kind yesterday..."
693,"Innkeeper: I thought you were just two kids, a couple of traveling performers... If those men are chasing you, you must be up to no good! Now get up and get out! You're a plague on decent folk!"
694,Nils: But... .......
695,Inkeeper: Whew... What a mess.
696,Lucius: Hmmm...
697,"Lyn: Where are we, Kent?"
698,"Kent: This is Kathelet. If we head due south, we'll pass into Caelin."
699,"Sain: From here, I'd say we're about ten days' ride to Castle Caelin. Assuming we don't run into any delays, of course."
700,Lyn: Ten days...
701,"Nils: Pardon me, but..."
702,Lyn: Yes? Can I help you?
703,Nils: You and your friends... Are you mercenaries?
704,Lyn: And if we are?
705,Nils: I need your help!
706,"Kent: Milady Lyndis, you mustn't let your guard down. Not even for a child."
707,"Lyn: I know. Forgive me, but we're in a hurry. Is there someone else you can ask?"
708,Nils: There's no time! Ninian's been... It's my sister! Some men have taken her away!
709,Sain: Your sister? Did you say your sister's been accosted?
710,Kent: Sain...
711,"Nils: That's right! By some cruel, awful men. I don't know what I'll do without Ninian."
712,Sain: Milady Lyndis! We must help him!
713,"Kent: Nonsense! We haven't the time! If the marquess is as ill as we've heard, we must proceed!"
714,"Lyn: Kent, I... I want to help this child."
715,Kent: Milady?
716,"Lyn: I'm worried about my grandfather, of course. But this! I cannot stand by and let a child be taken from her home!"
717,Kent: I see...
718,"Lyn: I'm sorry, Kent."
719,"Kent: I am your loyal retainer. You owe me no apologies. You must do as your heart dictates, milady. I will follow you, no matter where that may lead."
720,Lyn: Thank you.
721,"Sain: Hah! Such a noble speech! Ever the true knight, that one! Ah, well. You're in luck, laddie! Let's go get your sister!"
722,Lyn: Will you lead us to the men who've done this?
723,"Nils: Uh huh. They're really tough, so be careful."
724,"Lyn: Leave them to us. We're pretty tough ourselves. Right, Mark?"
725,"Nils: Ah! Oh, no..."
726,"Ruffian: Heh heh heh... Found him! C'mon, it's back to Nergal with you. Quiet now."
727,Nils: No! Let Ninian go!
728,"Ruffian: We ain't supposed to kill you, but we sure can rough you up! Get 'em!"
729,Ruffian: Huh? Who do you think you are?
730,Nils: Lyn!
731,Lyn: Let the boy's sister go.
732,"Ruffian: Ah... So you want to help the kid, huh? What a shame. You're gonna die for something that don't concern you."
733,"Lyn: You think so, do you? Do we look so meek to you? I think you're in for a terrible shock!"
734,"Ruffian: Stupid girl... You'll regret those words. Take 'em down, boys!"
735,"In-Game Message: Starting with this chapter, you'll be able to use the preparations screen. On this screen, you can choose who will fight, equip different items, and arrange your formation, among other things. If you have no special preparations to make, simply press START. This starts the chapter with the same group you were using at the end of the last chapter."
736,"Lyn: I see we're facing a shaman, Mark. I've heard that practitioners of the dark arts are fearsome foes. We'll have to be careful... What!? Who are you?"
737,Lucius: Please forgive me. I never meant to startle you.
738,Lyn: Your robes... They look like religious vestiary. Are you an Elimine bishop?
739,"Lucius: Yes... Well, no. I'm only an acolyte, an Elimine monk, to be specific. My name's Lucius."
740,Lyn: Do you have business with us?
741,Lucius: I was at the inn when this child came seeking help. The innkeeper was afraid to get involved. He was...unpleasant.
742,Nils: I wasn't afraid of him! I'm used to being treated that way.
743,Lyn: That's awful.
744,Lucius: May I please lend you my services? I truly wish to help the boy. If only a little.
745,Lyn: Of course.
746,Lucius: Thank you very much. The blessings of St. Elimine be upon you.
747,"In-game message: The monk Lucius has joined your group. Monks are users of the magic of light. Whose who wield magic are highly attuned to its flow, so they have a high magic resistance. Units with high magic resistances can reduce the damage caused by magical attacks. When magic users battle each other, they often find it hard to inflict damage. The light magic of monks is strong against the dark magic favored by shamans. Lucius should come in handy here. Let's put his magic to the test. Have Lucius attack the shaman nearest him."
748,"Lucius: Mark, isn't it? I am Lucius. I await your orders."
749,Lucius: You wish for me to attack the shaman? Very well.
750,"Lucius: I beg your pardon, but I would prefer to attack from here."
751,"Nils: I can help, too!"
752,Lyn: Nils! Can you fight?
753,"Nils: No... But I'm a bard, and bards are useful to have around!"
754,Lyn: A bard? Do you mean you're a minstrel? This is no place for a ballad or a saltarello.
755,"Nils: C'mon, trust me! I'm all yours, Mark."
756,"In-game message: It's time to see what Nils can do. The music played by bards allows your allies to move twice in the same turn. However, bards cannot engage in combat, so be careful not to expose them to danger."
757,Nils: Mark? I'm Nils! I'd like to perform for youm so give the word.
758,"Nils: You'd like me to play for Lucius, right?"
759,"Nils: I have to be next to him, so he can hear my tune!"
760,Nils: What do you think?
761,"Lyn: That was lovely... invigorating, even. You ought to play for me sometime. I could use the boost!"
762,Nils: Everyone could! My music can refresh you all!
763,"In-game message: Through the power of Nils's music, Lucius can move again this turn. Bards gain experience by playing music. Use Nils's powers often, and increase his skill."
764,"Girl: Hmmm... Maybe I could get some firewood out of it... Hm? Who's there? Who are you? Ah, you're just passing through? Pay me no mind. I was just thinking out loud. You see, there's an old tree on the other side of this mountain. It's just a dead old snag, really. I was just thinking of some way I could put it to good use. As I said, it's nothing that need concern you."
765,"Innkeeper: That's quite a group you've gotten yourself involved with. You do know you're facing the Black Fang, right? Anyone they target winds up... Well, you know. No one escapes the Fang! That's what they say, anyway. You and those odd children? I'd say you're finished. Not that I'll have any part of it. Course not!"
766,Hector: Blast! Eliwood's late. I wonder what's keeping him... ...Starting to think my axe'll rust over before he finds his way here.
767,Serra: Excuse me! Is anyone home? An empty house... how dull!
768,Hector: Whew... I thought she would find me for sure. She's been working for my brother in Bern. And now she's returned... Ahh...
769,Matthew: Huh? Milord! What brings you here?
770,"Hector: Ah, Matthew. Eliwood and I are here for our monthly bout."
771,"Matthew: You're still testing one another's fighting prowess, eh? It's a solid friendship you two share, that you can practice so faithfully."
772,"Hector: If you don't sharpen your blade, you lose your edge. So tell me, what are you doing here?"
773,Matthew: Milord Uther was curious about the succession issue here.
774,"Hector: Oh, the long-lost granddaughter thing, right? So which way does my brother lean?"
775,"Matthew: By my assessment, he will back the granddaughter's claim. The marquess's brother, Lundgren, is too ambitious by far. Left alone, we might wake to find him at Ostia's door before long."
776,"Hector: Sound advice, I think."
777,Matthew: My return to Ostia is going to be delayed a bit. Would you mind letting Lord Uther know?
778,Hector: What? So the marquess's brother is now your personal messenger?
779,"Matthew: You always did have a good sense of humor, milord. Don't forget my message!"
780,Hector: What impudence!
781,"Villager: So how much do you know about magic, huh? Magical attacks are special. You can't just avoid 'em like a sword or an axe. Not even if you're wearing armor. Who's tough against magic? Let me think... Well, anyone who uses magic or staves. Pegasus knights, too. Hm? You got others who need to battle magic users? I got something for 'em. It's a special kind of water. ""Pure water,"" it's called. Just sprinkle a bit on you. It'll protect you and lessen the damage you take a bit. Go on, take it. Don't be so shy. It'snot like I'm givin' you gold or anything. This stuff's strongest when you first put it on. It gets weaker as time passes, so be careful."
782,In-game message Got a Pure Water.
783,"Heintz: Who are you supposed to be? Playing the heroes in some foolish knightly romance? You may think you're helping the children, but you're only rushing to your doom!"
784,Heintz: You were only... striking at air... You are...too late. The girl is already--
785,Lyn: Nils! Where's your sister?
786,Nils: Ninian! Ninian... She's not here. Why? Where could she be?
787,Kent: My lady Lyndis! A villager spotted a group of men riding south.
788,Sain: The boy's dear sister... They must have her!
789,Lyn: Come! We must give chase!
790,Nils: But... But... We won't make it! What if they've already...
791,???: Are you looking for this girl here?
792,Nils: Ninian! Ninian!
793,Eliwood: She'll be fine. She's just lost consciousness.
794,Lyn: Who are you?
795,"Eliwood: I'm Eliwood, of Pherae. My father os the marquess."
796,Lyn: The marquess's son...
797,Eliwood: She was with a band of ruffians. She seemed upset. She looked in need of rescuing... Was I wrong to involve myself?
798,"Lyn: No, you saved her life. Thank you. My name is Lyn. I'm from Sacae. I'm Marquess Caelin's granddaughter."
799,Eliwood: Marquess Caelin?
800,"Lyn: And that's my story. It's not an easy tale to believe, I know..."
801,"Eliwood: No, I do believe you."
802,Lyn: What?
803,"Eliwood: At first glance, all I saw was a daughter of the plainsfolk. Now I can see it, though. You have your grandfather's eyes."
804,Lyn: Do you know my grandfather?
805,"Eliwood: The marquess, Lord Hausen, is my father's good friend. I also know that the proud people of Sacae tell no lies. It's true, isn't it?"
806,Lyn: Yes... Thank you. I would not have expected any Lycian noble to be so courteous to a Sacaean nomad.
807,Eliwood: You seemed to be in trouble. May I be of assistance?
808,"Lyn: Thank you for your kind offer. This is my problem, though, and I'll deal with it."
809,"Eliwood: I see. I'll be in the area for a few days longer. If you need anything, please let me know. Lyndis, I'm on your side."
810,Lyn: Eliwood... Thank you.
811,Nils: Ninian! Are you awake?
812,"Ninian: Nils? Is it really you? Oh, you're safe!"
813,Nils: Uh-huh. These people helped me.
814,Ninian: Who are they?
815,Nils: Uh...
816,Lyn: I'm Lyn. I'm glad you're feeling better.
817,"Ninian: Milady Lyn... Thank you. I'm called Ninian. My brother, Nils, and I are traveling performers."
818,"Lyn: Both of you? Your borther's a musician. How about you, Ninian?"
819,Ninian: I... I dance.
820,Sain: What? Oh my... you're a dancer!
821,"Lyn: Sain... Later, please."
822,"Sain: Um, yeah. Of course."
823,Lyn: A dancer? Your clothes don't look like those of a dancer.
824,Nils: Ninian dances to honor life. It's special... Sacred.
825,Lyn: A sacred dance? What does that mean?
826,"Ninian: I... The dance I perform when we travel is just a normal dance. My other dance, though... When they caught me, I twisted my ankle. I cannot dance to aid you... I'm sorry."
827,Lyn: Please don't worry. We're just happy to see that you're out of harm's way.
828,Ninian: Thank you.
829,Lyn: But I am concerned about your leg. You can't travel on it...
830,Nils: I've an idea. Would it be too much to ask that we travel with you?
831,Lyn: I can't allow that! It's far too dangerous. We're being hunted. We never know when we're going to be attacked.
832,"Nils: We wouldn't be a hinderance. We could even help you. Right, Ninian?"
833,Ninian: Yes. We might be able to repay our debt using our...special talents.
834,Lyn: Special abilities?
835,"Ninian: When something poses a threat to us, we can sense its approach."
836,Lyn: Truly? That's amazing!
837,"Nils: We can feel it coming, but we can't do anything to stop it. You're warriors, though, so you don't have that worry."
838,"Lyn: What do you think, Kent?"
839,Kent: I think leaving them here would cause Lady Lyndis more worry than having them travel with us.
840,"Lyn: Sain? Oh, never mind. I know what your answer is. Do you really want to travel with us?"
841,Nils: Of course!
842,"Ninian: You have our gratitude, milady."
843,Ninian: Oh...
844,"Nils: What's wrong, Ninian?"
845,Ninian: I've lost my ring.
846,Lyn: Your ring?
847,Nils: Not Ninis' Grace?
848,Ninian: The very one.
849,Nils: They stole it? Those curs!!!
850,Lyn: Was it valuable?
851,Ninian: It was a keepsake from our departed mother.
852,Nils: It was blessed by the spirit of Ninis... There's no other like it in the world. And now we have lost it to those villains. There's nothing we can do.
853,Ninian: You're right.
854,Lyn: ......
855,"Lyn: Can I talk to you, Mark? You heard all of that, right? What do you think? I'd really love to retrieve Ninian's ring for her. But if Nils is right, those thieves might prove to be too strong for us. What should we do?"
856,"In-game message: When you fulfill certain conditions, side quests may make themselves apparent to you. Side quests allow you to learn things that aren't part of the main story. You might meet tough new enemies or find new companions to travel with. However, side quests are very difficult, and once you begin one, you must see it through to its end. If you plan to challenge a side quest, I suggest you keep the save data from the previous mission. Not accepting side quests will not effect your ranking. If you're in a hurry to pursue the main story, skip the side quests."
857,In-game message: Embark on side quest? Yes/No?
858,"Lyn: You want to help them? That's great! I was hoping you'd say that, Mark. Kent! Sain! Those men were headed south. We must give pursuit!"

860,Lyn: There's no turning back now. Let's ride!
861,"A mysterious group seems hell-bent on capturing Nils and Ninian... Having failed, this group, the Black Fang, flees. Rumor has them traveling southwest. Lyn and her colleagues follow in hopes of recovering a lost heirloom. The Black Fang have made a stronghold of an abandoned castle in Khathelet. Its dark halls are alive with shadowy figures...
"
862,"Ursula: So the brother escaped, and the sister was rescued by a band of strangers. Do I understand you?"
863,"Beyard: Yes... They ambushed us, and..."
864,Ursula: Hold your excuses. The end is all that matters.
865,"Beyard: Yes, ma'am."
866,Ursula: And your plan for recovering the siblings is?
867,"Beyard: We've word the entire group is heading this way, with the brats in tow."
868,Ursula: They're coming here? Why would they do that?
869,"Beyard: They may well be after this ring... It's a rare piece. We took it from the girl. It was a stroke of luck that we did, especially if it brings them to us now. I'll grab the whole lot of 'em with this to bait the trap."
870,"Ursula: I see... Very well, I'll give you another chance. I've business elsewhere, but I shall return once it's finished. You have until sunrise tomorrow. Do you understand?"
871,Beyard: Yes.
872,Ursula: If you do not have the children when I return...my hand will deal you the fang's punishment. Remember that. Bear it closely in your mind.
873,Beyard: ......
874,Lyn: I believe they went in there.
875,"Nils: Milady, are you really going in there to get the ring back?"
876,"Lyn: Yes, we are."
877,"Nils: But this is their stronghold! They're bound to be well defended, not to mention well armed!"
878,Ninian: Please forget about the ring. It's OK...
879,"Lyn: Tactician's agreed to attempt this...recovery. I wouldn't be here if not for that. Tactician believes we can do this, and I'm sure that decision was not made lightly. With Tactician at my side, I'm confident we can win. Let's get you ring back, Ninian."
880,Nils: Milady...
881,Ninian: ......
882,Sain: Milady Lyndis! There are more of the foe inside than we thought.
883,Lyn: This is their stronghold. It's imperative we move carefully.
884,"Kent: Exactly, milady. This narrow corridor can be used to our advantage. If we draw the enemy through here, we can engage them in small numbers and remain relatively safe. If time is a concern, we can always rush them... If we do that, we'd better be sure we can win."
885,"Lyn: So, Tactician. What do you think? How we move forward is completely up to you."
886,"Beyard: How? This can't be... They should be dead! Everyone, get in there and finish them! This is our final chance!"
887,Beyard: I musn't fail. I cannot fail. The consequences are too--
888,Beyard: Earghh...
889,Beyard: Aaah... No... I... I cannot...
890,"Lyn: Give us the ring! And swear us this oath... You must promise to leave these two alone. If I have your vow, I'll spare your life..."
891,Beyard: Failure...means death...
892,Lyn: What?! Poison? He took his own life...
893,Kent: These are no common brigands we're dealing with. This man was trained by a well-organized group.
894,Lyn: What do they want with Nils and Ninian?
895,Nils: ......
896,"Lyn: Nils, Ninian. Everything's going to be fine. As long as you're with us, you'll be safe."
897,Nils: But...
898,"Lyn: You witnessed our victory, right? With Tactician's planning and my sword, you've no worries. If we all work together, there's nothing we can't overcome. I don't care who comes after you; I'll not let you be taken."
899,Nils: Really?
900,"Lyn: Yes, on my honor. Right, Tactician?"
901,Ninian: Milady...
902,"Lyn: Oh, yes... This is yours."
903,Ninian: Ah... It's...
904,"Lyn: You called it Nini's Grace, did you not? That lout had it."

908,"Passing through Araphen and Khathelet, Lyn and her friends arrive at in Caelin. However, Caelin is now under the rule of Lord Lundgren. Lundgren's henchmen lay in wait to assassinate Lyn. They wait for her approach and ready a special weapon.
"
909,"Lyn: Look, Mark! The mountains seem so far away now. We've come such a long way..."
910,Sain: Milady Lyndis! Mark! We can't be far from the castle now!
911,"Kent: By my reckoning, we can reach Castle Caelin in two days if we hurry."
912,"Lyn: Two more days... Hold on, Grandfather. Please..."
913,"Florina: Cheer up, Lyn. If they see you looking so sad, the entire company will lose heart."
914,Lyn: Florina... You're right. There's nothing to be gained by worrying. We just have to press onward.
915,Florina: That's the spirit!
916,Nils: Lyn... Danger approaches...
917,Lyn: What did you say?
918,Sain: I don't see anything. Are you sure?
919,"Ninian: I feel it, too. I'm sure of it. Ah! Milady, don't move!"
920,Lyn: Hm?
921,Lyn: What in--Where did this bolt come from?
922,Kent: They have a ballista!
923,Sain: Lord Lundgren is getting serious. Deploying siege engines is no mean feat.
924,Lyn: What is a ballista?
925,"Kent: It's a weapon designed for long-distance attacks. Only archers can use them, but they can be devastating."
926,Sain: Florina! You must stay aground! Do not take to the air! The ballista would target you in an instant.
927,Lyn: Is there a way to combat it?
928,"Kent: The safest course is to use someone with good defense as bait, so the enemy wastes arrows."
929,Sain: Then you can walk up and knock the fool on the head.
930,"Lyn: Wil, can you use a ballista?"
931,"Wil: I've never tried, but... It's just a really big bow, right? I should be able to figure it out."
932,Lyn: All we can ask is that you try... Let's see what we can do!
933,"Matthew: Ah, Lady Lyndis! Mark! I have some minor... business... to attend to. I'm unable to join you. If you need any of my possessions, please take them now."
934,"In-game message: On the far side of the hill to the south is a ballista. As Kent said, it's a weapon intended for trained archers. The attack range of ballistae is extremely large, so they can fire on enemies at great distances. As they can attack without fear of counterattack, they're quite useful. To use one, move an archer onto an unoccupied ballista, and select the ride command. After that, you can attack as usual. ballistae can also be moved while in use. Additionally, ballistae can be used by any archer in the field. So, if you can remove the enemy manning the ballista and move one of your group onto it... you'll find it most useful."
935,"Yogi: What are you curs waiting for? They're nothing but fleas! Call up for reinforcements, and rush 'em!"
936,"Villager: Do you remember the weapon triangle? Axes over lances and whatnot? This is important, so pay attention. There are some weapons that don't follow the normal rules. This here lancereaver is one of those. It's a sword that reverses the triangle. So if you wield this blade, you can best a lance with it. Of course, there's a downside... Axes can best this sword. Take this as a gift. It's your reward for listening to an old man ramble. Don't be so shy. It's not like I can use the thing. Not everyone can wield a sword of this caliber. I'm sure you know someone who can use it, though."
937,In-game message Got a Lancereaver.
938,"Yogi: Curses! The ballista must have been taken... What's going on here!? Somebody, get that girl!"
939,Yogi: Lord Lundgren... I've failed you... I pray you hurry...with those reinforcements...you promised.
940,Lyn: Is it over?
941,"Kent: Yes. I see no more enemy soldiers. However, something is bothering me."
942,Lyn: What is it?
943,Kent: I noticed it during the fighting. Our opponents... They were soldiers of Caelin. I even recognized some of those we fought. I trained with many of them... Amd yet they attacked us without hesitation.
944,"Sain: They're black-hearted traitors who've joined Lord Lundgren. Good riddance, I say. It also means less resistance at the castle."
945,Kent: I hope you're right...
946,"Lyn: I'm just glad Nils and Ninian were with us. If that first shot had hit me, I might not have survived."
947,Ninian: We are honored to have served you well.
948,Nils: We won't let you down!
949,Lyn: I know. I'm relying on you.
950,"Matthew: What's this? You dealt with the ballista, too? Nicely done!"
951,"Lyn: Matthew, where were you during all this?"
952,"Matthew: I went to the village to sniff about for information. I got some interesting news for my trouble, too."
953,Lyn: Let's hear it!
954,"Matthew: First, about Marquess Caelin's illness. He really is unwell. He's been abed for nigh on three months."
955,"Lyn: Oh, no... Grandfather..."
956,"Matthew: I heard an interesting rumor about his condition, though. The people believe that someone's been poisoning the marquess..."
957,Lyn: He's being poisoned!?
958,"Matthew: And this someone... Well, everyone's too afraid to mention a name. However, they say that as soon as the marquess took ill, a certain noble took control of the castle as though it were his own. I fed a hungry inkeeper some coin, and he fed me a name. The marquess of Caelin's own brother, Lord Lundgren."
959,"Lyn: How can this be? How can they allow him to get away with this? The villagers know he's the one poisoning my grandfather, and yet no one raises a hand against him? Why?"
960,"Kent: They are afraid, and they lack proof. The whisperings of the common people means nothing."
961,"Matthew: That's the truth of it. And of the marquess's loyal retainers who might have lent credence to these rumors, there is no sign."
962,Lyn: Are you saying they've been silenced?
963,Matthew: It's a fair assumption.
964,Kent: This is beyond believing.
965,Matthew: The worst news is yet to come.
966,Sain: What? There's more?
967,"Matthew: An imposter's appeared, claiming to be the marquess's granddaughter. At least, that's the story Lundgren's telling to all who'll listen."
968,Lyn: What does that mean?
969,Matthew: It means that people are waiting for two traitorous knights and a baseborn child to appear and lay claim to Castle Caelin.
970,Sain: But... But that... It can't be!
971,Kent: Traitors? Us? Ridiculous!!!
972,Lyn: He says... I'm an imposter?
973,Matthew: Don't you have anything that proves your lineage?
974,"Lyn: When my mother joined the Lorca, she brought nothing of Lycia with her."
975,"Sain: Milady, Marquess Araphen himself remarked at your resemblance to Lady Madelyn! Your face is your proof!"
976,"Kent: They'll say we found a look-alike somewhere... We're seen as betrayers of our knightly vows. Our word means nothing. No, our only hope is to see Marquess Caelin himself."
977,"Lyn: We must hurry. If not, my grandfather... I must see him! With my last breath if need be."
978,"Matthew: But we must formulate some manner of plan! Even if we set out for the castle, the troops patrolling the area will cause no end of problems. You have been branded as oathbreakers, after all."
979,"Lyn: I've got it! Eliwood... He seemed sympathetic to our plight. He should still be in Khathelet. If we can talk to him, he might help us!"
980,Kent: Of course! A sound idea!
981,Sain: Let's hurry!
982,Lyn: Yes! Back to Khathelet!!
983,"Note: The script is from Lyn Normal Mode

985,"Tutorial:
Wallace is a level 12 knight. He can rise as high as level 20. Most units can change classes once they reach level 10. By changing classes, units can improve all of their abilities. Movement range, constitution, usable weapons… Everything. There are many benefits. With a single action, you can make your units significantly more powerful. In order to change classes, units need to be of a certain level. However, you also need a special item. For example, Wallace is carrying a knight crest. With this, cavaliers and knights can change classes. Each character class has its own unique item that allows units of that class to switch to a different class. Well then, why don’t we try changing class now? Select Wallace, then choose knight crest from his items and use it.

990,"Lyn: Eliwood, I don’t know how to thank you…"
991,"Eliwood: All I’ve done is convince them to remain neutral in this dispute. However, this means I cannot aid you in any way either. Will you be all right?"
992,Lyn: I will win. I have to. It’s the only way that I can help my grandfather.
993,"Eliwood: I understand. Although I cannot help you directly, as a friend, I pray for your success."

995,"Lyn: All right, everyone! Let’s get going!! This weather is turning foul. It looks like a fog is rolling in."
996,"Kent: This is no good. If the fog thickens, we’ll be blind in battle. It will be difficult to fight what we cannot see."
997,"Lyn: We can’t let it delay us, though. Let us press on. We must get closer to the castle. What’s the best route?"

1003,"Lyn: Kent, who is this?"
1004,Kent: He used to be the commander of the knights of Caelin.
1005,Sain: Aren’t you supposed to be retired? I heard you were sowing fields now.
1006,"Wallace: I am, and I was. Then I received orders from Lord Lundgren. I was told to capture an imposter and a pair of rogue knights."
1007,"Kent: Lord Wallace! Surely, you don’t believe us to be oathbreakers, do you?"
1008,Wallace: Bring me the girl that claims to be Lady Madelyn’s child.

1013,Lyn: Enough! I’m right here! I am Lyndis.
1014,Wallace: Ah…
1015,Lyn: I’ll understand if you don’t believe me. But I’ve had enough of you and your foolish posturing!
1016,Wallace: Hmm… Such beautiful eyes…
1017,Lyn: Pardon?
1018,"Wallace: I’ve been a knight for 30 years, and here is one thing I learned. A person with eyes as bright and true as yours is no deceiver. Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ah, yes! I like you, girl! Why, I believe I’ll even join your little band of mercenaries!"
1019,Sain: Are you… Are you serious?
1020,Wallace: This old bull’s pledged his loyalty to Caelin. I would never allow an usurper on the throne. Let’s march!

Take one of mine. Use this when it’s foggy, and you can see a bit better. Hm? No, no need for thanks. I know all about you and your comrades.

1038,Eagler: You speak with conviction. I think it’s time to test the bounds of loyalty!
1039,Eagler: Kent! Is that you?
1040,Kent: General Eagler! We found Lady Lyndis on the orders of the marquess. We’ve worked so very hard to return her safely to Caelin.
1041,Eagler: And yet you have no proof of the girl’s identity. Is that not true?
1042,"Kent: Yes, but…"
1043,Eagler: Then our talk is finished! Draw your weapon and come!
1044,Wallace: Eagler!
1045,"Eagler: General Wallace… So you’ve sided with the girl, too, have you?"
1046,"Wallace: I fight for Caelin’s honor, not for Lundgren’s lies!"
1047,Eagler: Ah… Is that so? You are– Enough! There’s nothing more to be said. I name you traitors all! Come! Do your worst!
1048,"Wallace: Fool… At the very least, let mine be the blow that finishes you!"
1049,"Eagler: Imposters to the throne, you shall not pass! No quarter for traitors!"
1050,Eagler: Nnng… Go… Go quickly. The marquess… He knows nothing of this… His life is… There’s no illness. Only…poison… Please…for the marquess…for all of Caelin…
1051,Lyn: What kind of man was General Eagler?
1052,"Kent: When Sain and I first became knights, he was our captain. Our teacher…"
1053,Lyn: I think he must have known we were telling the truth. Why did he force the fight?
1054,"Sain: Something must have… Lord Lundgren was exerting some hold on him… Eagler was trying to protect someone. A friend perhaps, or family."
1055,Kent: ……
1056,Lyn: May Lundgren never know the peaceful embrace of Mother Earth! I care not what others do. I WILL stop that man! Mark! The final battle is approaching!
1057,"Lundgren: How are you feeling today, my dear brother?"
1058,Lord Hausen (off screen): Lundgren… You… You fiend…
1059,"Lundgren: Your granddaughter is dead by now. And soon, you will join her."
1060,Lord Hausen (off screen): Lyndis… Why did this happen? I… I only wanted to see her once.
1061,"Lundgren: Have you lost all hope? Has your life lost all meaning? Then hurry up and die, you miserable old dotard! You and your precious granddaughter are in my way!!! I curse your name! I despise you! My worthless wretch of a brother!"
1062,"General Eagler has been defeated. Lyn and her band draw ever nearer to Castle Caelin. Within the castle walls, Lyn’s bitter enemy, Lundgren, awaits… A man who would kill his own kin for a throne. He is the source of all her troubles. He must be stopped.
"
1063,"“Got an Energy ring”
"
1064,"For his bravery in fulfilling his command, Kent is named Knight Commander of Caelin. It is a high honor for one so young, but no one denies his worth.
"
1065,"Sain has earned the honor of being named subcommander of the Caelin knights. Despite his promotion, he still scoffs at authority and woos the village girls. He is much loved by the citizenry.
"
1066,"Florina has arranged to stay in Caelin. She spends her every waking hour in rigorous training, hoping to become invaluable to Lyn. Her fear of men has lessened, but…only slightly.
"
1067,"With his cheery outlook and his happy-go-lucky demeanor, Wil has become quite dear to Marquess Caelin’s household. Kent is teaching him manners befitting a sworn man of Castle Caelin.
"
1068,"Once Lyn’s true heritage is recognized in Caelin, Dorcas returns to his home in Bern. There, he cares for his wife and makes a good living as a mercenary, fighting the local bandits.
"
1069,"Ultimately, Erk succeeds in seeing Serra safely to Ostia. While her behavior is irritating at best, she is sorely missed. Her ascerbic tongue has become legendary.
"
1070,"His contract with Serra complete, Erk sets off for Etruria. His time as a mercenary is just part of his training, and he is glad to see it end. He has since returned to his mentor.
"
1071,"In the celebration following Lyn’s return to Caelin, Rath slips out unseen. Whether he has returned to Sacae or has continued to work as a mercenary, no one knows.
"
1072,"Matthew vanishes after the final battle, and his whereabouts remain a mystery.
"
1073,"Nils and his sister, Ninian, take their leave of Castle Caelin after a few days. He may well be traveling the land, mastering his musical skills somewhere.
"
1074,"Lucius studies in Caelin for a time, but he departs after receiving summons to another land. He has since been seen traveling with a hard-eyed mercenary.
"
1075,"For Wallace, Lyn’s struggle only whets his appetite for battle. He sets off in search of a cause worthy of his blade. He lacks any sense of direction, so it may be years before he returns.
"
1076,"Mark leaves Lyn to continue his/her training. He plans on traveling throughout Lycia. Lyn refuses to say good-bye, believing in her heart that she will see him/her again.
"
1077,"Lyn now lives with her grandfather as Lady Lyndis of Castle Caelin. Under her loving care, Lord Hausen recovers, and now the two of them go for many walks in the Caelin gardens.
"
1078,"On clear, dry nights, Lyn can be seen high atop a hill near the castle. Perhaps she is remembering the home of her youth, the plains of Sacae.
"
1079,"Would you like to continue playing? [Yes] [No]
"
1080,"One year later…
"
1081,"Kent: Lady Lyndis, you should be able to see Castle Caelin once we pass these mountains."
1082,Lyn: Grandfather… I’ll be with you soon.
1083,Kent: Everything rests on this next battle.
1084,Sain: Lundgren will not be receiving the reinforcements he expected. He’ll move against us with everything he has soon.
1085,"Lyn: Let him come! Let them all come! I will not be turned away! I will see my grandfather… I’ve come too far to let anyone stand in my way. This is it, Mark. This is our final test. My friends, for one last time, lend me your strength!"
1086,"Lyn: Those clouds look bad. It’s going to rain soon. Let’s go, Mark. We should press on while we’re still able."
1087,Lyn: Look! The clouds are breaking. This rain should stop soon…
1088,"Lyn: It’s begun to rain, but… the sky looks mostly clear. The rain won’t last long."
1089,"Young Lady: Oh, no! If I don’t bring in the laundry now… Oh, hello. Are you a soldier? Sounds like a hard life… Especially when it rains. Rain must make it difficult for you to move around. I used to ride horses when I was little. Oh, I remember how those horses disliked the rain. It’s better to be on foot when it’s wet. Nomadic horses are trained on the plains, so they’re better with rain, but… Well, rain just seems to make it hard for everyone to get around. The weather around here can change in no time at all. I recommend just staying in one place until the rain clears up."
1090,"Young Man: You’re here to fight Lundgren, aren’t you? Do you have enough weapons? Lundgren’s no ordinary knight: he’s a general. Iron weapons lack the edge to penetrate his armor. If you need something, visit my father’s armory. You should go to the shop next door to his, too. They’ve many powerful weapons and items you can use against Lundgren. Head south and cross the river. You’ll see them. Lundgren’s a tricky one. He’s destroyed the bridge. There’s an old snag next to the river, though… If you knocked it over, you should be able to cross. Travel well. You fight for us all."
1091,"Man: You know, you really should visit the armory next door. They’ve got all you need if you’re fighting knights and generals. You need something to defeat Lundgren, right? Once he’s been beaten, maybe peace will return to Caelin. Good luck to you!"
1092,"Old lady: You’ve finally made it here, have you? Such a long way… We’re all behind Lady Lyndis. All of us. Here, take this. Use it in your battle against Lundgren, please. It’s an energy ring. It’ll increase your strength and magic power a bit. There are lots of items that augment your abilities. These are hard to come by, so think carefully before you use them. Of course, not using them at all would be a terrible waste as well, right? Items like this might vanish once you’ve used them. Bear that in mind, and use them wisely."
1093,Lundgren: So you’re the girl claiming kinship with my brother!
1094,"Lyn: You’ll play this farce to the end, won’t you Lundgren?"
1095,Lundgren: The royal house of Caelin has no need of a Sacaen mongrel! I’ll put an end to this foolishness here and now!
1096,"Lyn: To further your own black ambitions, you’ve harmed my grandfather and the very land you ought to serve. I have neither pity nor mercy for you. Lundgren! Prepare yourself!"
1097,Lundgren: Whelp!
1098,"Lundgren: Ah. One of the traitors. You must be…Kent, yes?"
1099,"Kent: Lundgren, your treachery precedes you. I will not listen to any of your poisoned words!"
1100,Lundgren: You’re a fool! You’ll wish you’d never turned your coat!
1101,"Lundgren: Ah, Sain… You’re not like that stubborn fool, Kent. You’re reasonable. Leave this child, Lyndis, and stand at my side. You will go far in my service."
1102,"Sain: That is a gracious offer, my lord…"
1103,Lundgren: Quite…
1104,"Sain: However, I am rather fond of my friend the stubborn fool. And if I am to pledge my service to any liege, I would choose lovely Lady Lyndis over Foul Lundgren, regardless of the risk!"
1105,Lundgren: Fool! I will make you regret your decision!
1106,"Lundgren: This is my realm, and you’ve entered without my permission. You will not leave these lands alive!"
1107,Lundgren: That annoying little girl… Nothing but a savage from Sacae… The Caelin throne…should be…mine…
1108,"Lyn: We’ve won… At last, I can see my grandfather."
1109,"Reissmann: You are Lady Lyndis, are you not?"
1110,Lyn: Who are you?
1111,"Reissmann: I am Reissmann, the chancellor of the Caelin royal family. I had receive word from Kent and Sain when you first met, but then Lundgren discovered the message and imprisoned me. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to your true home."
1112,Lyn: Thank you. May I see my grandfather now?
1113,"Reissmann: Yes, of course. Do not be shocked by what you see. Lundgren has been poisoning the marquess’s meals for some time. His body has been ravaged… He’s been bedridden for months."
1114,Lord Hausen: Who is there? I said no visitors. I will see no one.
1115,Lyn: ……
1116,Lord Hausen: What are you doing? Leave me…to die…
1117,Lyn: Um… Pardon me… My name is… I’m Lyndis.
1118,Lord Hausen: Eh? Did you say Lyndis? Is that…
1119,"Lyn: My father’s name was Hassar, chieftain of the Lorca. My mother was…Madelyn. I was raised on the plains."
1120,"Lord Hausen: … Could it be? Come, come here. Let me see your face."
1121,Lord Hausen: Oh… Yes… There is no doubt… You are Madelyn’s trueborn child… Uhhh…ahhhh…
1122,Lyn: Grandfather!
1123,"Lord Hausen: Lundgren told me that my daughter had died. My heir…and you, too. He told me you were dead. Thank you… Thank you for living. Ahhhh… I am blessed…"
1124,"Lyn: Mother and Father were slain last year by brigands. I… I was the only survivor. I lived on, but…"
1125,"Lord Hausen: Lyndis, please forgive a prideful old man. If I had but accepted your parents’ love… There would have been no bandits. We would have lived here together in perfect peace."
1126,"Lyn: Grandfather. My parents… My tribe… Our life was one of love and peace. The end was tragic, but… up until the attack, we were truly happy."
1127,"Lord Hausen: Truly? Madelyn had a life of happiness? Knowing that gives me so much joy. Thank you, Lyndis. I can die in peace now…"
1128,Lyn: No! Grandfather! You mustn’t say that!
1129,"Lord Hausen: There’s no avoiding it, Lyndis. I’ve taken too much poison for far too long. It’s too late…"
1130,"Lyn: Be brave, Grandfather! You will recover! Believe me! On the plains, we say that illness fails in the face of a strong heart! I am with you now! You mustn’t give up!"
1131,Lord Hausen: You’re…with me…
1132,"Lyn: Yes. We have so much to talk about. Walks to take, music to listen to. There’s so much I want to do with you, so much lost time we can recover!"
1133,Lord Hausen: That does sound… nice.
1134,"Lyn: Doesn’t it? And once you’re well, I’ll take you to the plains. I’ll show you the endless sky, the oceans of grass… I want you to know the lands my mother loved so much!"
1135,Lord Hausen: The lands Madelyn loved… You’re right. I still have… quite a bit of living to do.
1136,"Lyn: You can do it, Grandfather!"
1137,Lord Hausen: Lyndis…
1138,Sain: Lady Lyndis! Do you honestly plan on remaining here? Tell me truly!
1139,"Lyn: Yes, until my grandfather is well. I can’t leave him now. I won’t."
1140,"Kent: The physician says that Lord Hausen looks like a new man. It’s like he was never ill. And it’s all thanks to you, milady."
1141,Lyn: He’s the only family I have left. I want him to have a long life.
1142,Florina: Lady Lyndis!
1143,"Lyn: What is it, Florina?"
1144,"Florina: I’ve been taken into service by House Caelin! From here on, Lyn… I mean, Lady Lyndis… We’ll be together always!"
1145,"Lyn: Really? Oh, that pleases me so…but… Please don’t call me Lady Lyndis. For you, I’m still just Lyn."
1146,Florina: My pegasus and I fly for your house now. I am your servant. There are rules to follow.
1147,Lyn: Florina!
1148,Florina: I’m happiest when I’m with you. That’s more important than how I address you… Please…
1149,"Lyn: I suppose I’ll just have to get used to it, right? Very well. I understand."
1150,"Florina: Oh, thank you! I do love you, Lyn!"
1151,Florina: Oops! I mean… Lady Lyndis!
1152,"Lyn: Ha ha ha… Oh, Florina!"
1153,"Wil: Lady Lyndis! I’ve decided to stay, too!"
1154,Lyn: Wil? Weren’t you planning on returning home?
1155,"Wil: Well, I was but… I’ve grown quite fond of Lyndis’s Legions, you know… I couldn’t possibly leave everyone behind. I’ll send word to my family regarding my decision."
1156,"Lyn: I’m pleased to have you, Wil. Thank you."
1157,"Wil: Thank you, milady."
1158,"Lyn: Mark… you’re leaving, aren’t you? No, I’m not asking you to stay. It’s just… I’ll miss you. When I found you unconscious on the plains… I had no idea we would be together for so long. You’ve helped us so much, and I’m sure you’ve learned all you can from us. You’ll do just fine on your own. I have the utmost faith that you’ll be a master tactician, Mark. That’s from someone who’s seen you at work!"
1159,"Lyn: Well then, take care… I… I hope I see you again. I’m sure that I will someday…"
1160,Tutorial: Here ends Lyn’s story. Would you like to save your progress? [Yes] [No]
1161,"Tutorial: As of Chapter 11, Eliwood becomes the story’s main character. Mark’s role will be to act as tactician, aiding his group. Help Eliwood to fulfill the chapter goals and fight his way to the end of the game. You’ll start your first campaign with Eliwood, then meet his friend, Hector, in chapter 12. And who knows? You might even meet Lyn again. If any of these three is defeated, your game will be over. The game will continue if any other allied units are defeated. However, a defeated unit can never take part in combat again, so be careful!"
1162,"Once, dragon fought man in a war called the Scouring... Mankind vanquished the dragons thanks to the efforts of eight heroes. These eight mighty generals brought peace to Elibe. The continent was divided into nations, and the people enjoyed an easy prosperity. The hero Hartmut settled in the east and founded Bern, famed for its military might. St. Elimine moved west, and her sacred name flourished among the artisans of Etruria. The horseman Hanon's legacy lived on with the nomads of his beloved plains of Sacae. The birthplace of the knight Barigan is now home to the renowned Knights of Ilia. The berserker Durban's final glory was to create a warrior's clan in the Western Isles. The archsage Athos is said to have retired to the barren wasteland of Nabata. The heirs of the champion Roland themselves became the lords of the Lycian League. Elibe has enjoyed a peace that spans 980 years... How much longer can this peace stand before its foundations begin to crumble? Deep within the Lycian League lies Pherae, a land that has known no conflict for many generations, but which now finds itself touched by a shadow of unease. Its beloved and benevolent ruler, Lord Elbert, has mysteriously vanished... as have a number of his sworn men, loyal knights who serve at his side. A month has passed without word from the marquess. Rumors of his death abound. However, the marquess's son believes his father lives, and he has vowed to find him. Marquess Pherae's son, Eliwood: A red-haired youth who will one day become the finest knight in all of Lycia. His long journey begins here.
"
1163,"One Year Later...
"
1164,"A month has passed since word came of Marquess Pherae's disappearance. Rumors and speculation run rampant throughout Lycia. The head of House Ostia, Lord Uther, takes no apparent interest. The marquess's younger brother is considered odd by the populace. He and Marquess Pherae's son, Eliwood, are fast friends. A hot-blooded youth, he cannot ignore his friend's plight. Marquess Ostia's younger brother, Hector. He would one day be a courageous general, a steel warrior to be feared. The path he chooses will test him to the limits of his strength.
"
1165,"Hector: Brother! Brother!! Where is he!? He's here, isn't he?"
1166,Oswin: Lord Hector! Calm yourself!
1167,"Hector: No words, Oswin! Just move!"
1168,"Uther: That's enough, Hector! What is the meaning of this?"
1169,Hector: You know full well! The disappearance of Marquess Pherae!
1170,Uther: We've discussed this time and time again. This matter is none of Ostia's affair. We have no reason to involve ourselves. It would be folly to do so.
1171,"Hector: Eliwood's father is missing, for goodness' sake! We know that Marquess Laus is connected in some way. I say we use Ostia's might to end this mystery and find the truth!"
1172,"Uther: Calm yourself, you fool! An invasion would be madness! Lycia can ill afford the chaos such an action would bring. Surely even you must understand that!"
1173,"Hector: Bah... I understand all too well, Brother! Stay there on your throne. Sit there until it rots beneath you! I will do this alone!!"
1174,Oswin: Lord Hector! You should watch your tone...
1175,"Uther: Peace, Oswin. Let him go. There's no reasoning with him when he gets like this."
1176,Oswin: .......
1177,Hector: Matthew! Matthew! Blast it! Where could he be?
1178,Matthew: I'm right here.
1179,Hector: You... You're not a wraith. Stop skulking in the shadows like one.
1180,"Matthew: Hm? A wraith? And here I thought I was a spy. Be that as it may. As milord ordered, here are your travel rations and your beloved axe. And I've purchased the silence of some royal guardsmen. You're free to slip out the rear entrance and vanish."
1181,"Hector: Well done, Matthew. Try not to let my brother discover my absence too quickly."
1182,Matthew: What? I thought I was going with you.
1183,"Hector: You're a bigger fool than I'd imagined! Did you think I would trust my brother's spy? Who knows when you would turn me in for some favor! Where I go, I go alone!"
1184,"Matthew: Shh! You keep on shouting, and you'll go nowhere! Every guard in the palace must have heard that!"
1185,Hector: Enough... Do not try and follow me!
1186,"Matthew: I did not imagine you would find me so untrustworthy. Professional hazard, it seems. Watch yourself, young master."
1187,Hector: Huh? He... He gave up too easily. I don't trust him... The time has come... I've got to get out of here and rendezvous with Eliwood. These bags! What did Matthew put in these things?
1188,Hector: This is ridiculous even if he was packing for two! Huh? .......Come out. I know you're there.
1189,Mercenary: .......
1190,Hector: Who are you?
1191,Mercenary: .......
1192,"Hector: Too dumb to speak? Makes no difference to me. Move out of my way, or I'll run you through!"
1193,Hector: Hah!
1194,Matthew: Whoa! M-Milord! Stay your arm! It's me!
1195,Hector: Who? Matthew? I was sure you were one of them.
1196,"Matthew: Well, I'm not! I'm one of me. And I would prefer to remain in one piece."
1197,"Hector: Your fault for jumping out of nowhere. Now tell me, what are you doing here?"
1198,Matthew: Hm? I... I sensed that something was wrong and...came to your aid.
1199,Hector: My aid... I'll accept that answer for the time being.
1200,"Matthew: So, what should we do?"
1201,Hector: About what?
1202,"Matthew: About the fellows between us and the way out. I'd say there are 7 or 8 of them. To make matters worse, they seem highly competent. I know you're confident in your martial abilities, but... I'm not the strongest sword arm around, and, well..."
1203,"Hector: If you've something to say, Matthew, then say it!"
1204,"Matthew: We could abandon the rear entrance. I'm sure the royal guardsmen would be happy to aid us, and..."
1205,Hector: Never!
1206,"Matthew: That's what I thought you would say. All that's left is to avoid getting killed, right?"
1207,Hector: You can go back if you want.
1208,"Matthew: In your own words, milord, never. I'm with you, wherever that may lead."
1209,Hector: Right. Then let's give them a good thrashing and get out of here!
1210,"Hector: You're not Marquess Laus's assassins, are you? You're too good, too professional. Nothing like those idiots over there."
1211,"Wire: You've no need to know, little Lord Hector. A fool like you, sneaking out of the country alone... You'll go missing, never to return. Your body will never be found. Tidy story, eh? Ha ha..."
1212,Hector: Tsk tsk... Looks like your luck's run out.
1213,Wire: Our luck? What are you...
1214,"Hector: You see, I'm about as angry as I've ever been. I doubt that even a dozen of you could slow me down. Prepare to die!!!"
1215,Wire: The Ostian spy. Why did you return?
1216,"Matthew: I've known you were here for some time. I also knew you were after Lord Hector, not me. You're all professional assassins. You wait for your chance, and you don't miss it. You were waiting for me to leave Lord Hector alone. That's when you were planning to attack, right?"
1217,"Wire: Ah... So that's why you came back, is it? I was sure you'd gone back to play with the guards."
1218,"Matthew: If I had, I would've taken Lord Hector with me. No matter what it took."
1219,"Wire: Cheeky fellow, aren't you? But you're out of your league."
1220,Matthew: How so?
1221,"Wire: You think to challenge me? Prepare to die, you witless fool!"
1222,Matthew: Ghaa...
1223,"Matthew: Whew... That was close. Glad we're both all right. Come, milord, we must fly! The castle guard must have heard all the noise."
1224,"Hector: Matthew, you rogue. You knew this was all going to happen, didn't you?"
1225,Matthew: What else could I do? Those assassins wouldn't show themselves until you were alone.
1226,"Hector: I suppose... Mark my words, Matthew! You're coming with me. But from this point forward, you are no longer my brother's spy. You are my man now, to the bitter end."
1227,"Matthew: Yes, milord! Shall I swear a knightly vow?"
1228,Hector: To what purpose? Your own words will hold you well enough.
1229,Matthew: True enough!
1230,Hector: Let us go then! To Eliwood!
1231,"Hector: Is it…over? Oh, no… I can’t…… ……… I can’t mourn you now. Matthew… If I turn back now… Your… Your death will… It will be for naught. I must find Eliwood… I cannot afford to waste a minute more!"
1232,Soldier: My lord! Marquess! It's Lord Hector! He's--
1233,"Uther: He's gone, isn't he?"
1234,"Soldier: Ye... Yes, milord! We are gathering men now to give chase."
1235,Uther: Attend me. We will let him go.
1236,Soldier: Milord?
1237,Uther: A... Headstrong fool... Oooh... Cough...cough...
1238,Oswin: Lord Uther! Are you well?
1239,Uther: ... ...I'm fine. It has passed. There is no need for concern.
1240,Oswin: You must not rely so much on physical strength alone. It has been most trying these past few weeks. The affairs of the court have not let you sleep. You might endanger your health if you keep on...
1241,"Uther: Yes, Oswin. I understand. I will speak with a physician on the morrow. Will that allay your fears?"
1242,"Oswin: Yes, my lord. I shall make the arrangements."
1243,"Uther: Oswin... About Hector... I can entrust him to you, yes?"
1244,"Oswin: Of course, my lord. I will guard him with my very life's blood."
1245,"After speaking with the village magistrate, Eliwood and company set their sights on Laus. The road from Pherae to Laus passes through Santaruz. Eliwood suspects his missing father must have visited Santaruz en route to Ostia. Eliwood arranges a meeting with the local ruling lord to see what he can learn.
"
1246,"Before Battle
"
1247,"Hector leaves Ostia. He moves towards Santaruz to meet up with Eliwood as quickly as possible. He encounters a mysterious group whose dark garb hide an even darker secret. Perhaps these same powers have turned their blades on Eliwood...Hector hurries south, praying for his friend's safety.
"
1248,"Dorcas: Here we go again, eh, Mark? Just like old times... Seems our fates are bound. Natalie? Oh, she's still in Pherae. I'm working for you this time, so she's not too worried. Guide my axe, Mark."
1249,Matthew: Lord Hector! I have it! I know where Lord Eliwood is. He entered Santaruz not far from here.
1250,"Hector: Is that so? We've read his movements fairly well, then. Let's move due south and cross the border. We'll meet up with him in Santaruz!"
1251,Serra: Ah! There you are! Lord Hector!
1252,"Matthew: Oh, no..."
1253,Hector: Serra? W-What... What are you doing here?
1254,"Serra: You're going to meet Lord Eliwood, right? Well, I want to go, too!"
1255,Hector: Go home! This is no game.
1256,Serra: But Oswin told me it was all right to come!
1257,Hector: Oswin?
1258,"Oswin: Yes, my lord. On the marquess's orders. Serra and I will be accompanying you."
1259,"Hector: Bah. This is ridiculous. Always have to have the last word, eh, Brother?"
1260,"Oswin: No matter what you think, he's just worried about you, Lord Hector. You're the only family he has."
1261,Hector: I know...
1262,Matthew: Lord Hector! Up ahead! There appears to be fighting.
1263,Hector: Where? Is it Eliwood? Come! Let's get closer! Hurry! Oswin! Matthew!
1264,"Matthew: Yes, my lord!"
1265,"Serra: Oh! Wait for me! I'm coming, too!"
1266,Hector: Hey! What's going on over there? Looks like some rough business. You! Soldier! Are you just going to stand there and watch?
1267,Soldier: Who do you think you are? This is Santaruz. What occurs here is no affair of any foreign lordling!
1268,"Hector: I believe I'm going to have to disagree with you. You see, the man they're attacking happens to be a friend of mine."
1269,Soldier: A friend? What? ...Urrrgh!!
1270,"Hector: Sorry, but I'm in a hurry."
1271,Serra: Ewww! That's terrible! I loathe violence!
1272,"Matthew: Nicely done, my lord! You're a fighter born."
1273,Oswin: I cannot condone resorting to force so quickly...
1274,"Hector: Chastise me later, Oswin. First, we deal with these brigands! Come! We must help Eliwood!"
1275,Oswin: Help Eliwood? Sounds like a convenient excuse for more violence.
1276,Hector: Oswin!
1277,"Oswin: Yes, yes. I'm coming!"
1278,Hector: Matthew! Bring Serra and follow along.
1279,Matthew: What! With...Serra?
1280,Serra: No! I want to go with you now!
1281,Hector: Absolutely not! You'll slow us down! zzz
1282,Serra: Oh! How rude!
1283,Hector: Oswin! Let's go!
1284,Hector: Whew... Is that all of them?
1285,Eliwood: Hector! Where did you come from?
1286,"Hector: Well met, Eliwood."
1287,"Eliwood: Yes, but...what are you doing here?"
1288,Hector: You wound me!
1289,Eliwood: How do you mean?
1290,"Hector: You're looking for your father, right? Why didn't you send word?"
1291,"Eliwood: Your brother was just named Marquess Ostia. He's going to be very busy setting up his court council. Lord Uther must need your support. You are his brother, after all."
1292,"Hector: My brother is not so weak. Oh, he has mentioned some things in public, but... He knew exactly what I was planning, and he let me go."
1293,"Eliwood: Is that so? Well then, it would be unwise to refuse his kindness! It does me good to see you, Hector. Thank you."
1294,"Hector: Think nothing of it. You know Oswin, don't you?"
1295,"Oswin: Well met, Lord Eliwood."
1296,"Eliwood: It is good to see you again, Oswin. So you came as well?"
1297,Oswin: Yes. Lord Uther was worried about Lord Hector traveling alone. I've been ordered to keep a close eye on him.
1298,Eliwood: Ha ha ha! Of course! Good to have you with us.
1299,Serra: Lord Hector! Why didn't you tell me the fighting was done!?
1300,Matthew: I apologize for the interruption. I couldn't restrain her any longer!
1301,"Eliwood: Are these your companions, Hector?"
1302,"Hector: Oh... Yes, I suppose they are. One might have hoped for better, but..."
1303,"Serra: That was uncalled for! I can't believe you said that! Matthew, did you hear what he said about you?"
1304,Matthew: Me? He was talking about you!
1305,"Eliwood: Hector, why don't you introduce us?"
1306,"Hector: The noisy one is Serra. Believe it or not, she's a cleric."
1307,"Serra: Yes, I am Serra, my lord. Pleased to meet you."
1308,Hector: And that's Matthew. He does a lot of...sneaking around.
1309,Matthew: My lord.
1310,Eliwood: Sneaking...around.
1311,"Matthew: Well... I, er...gather information, open doors, chests, and such. I've got...nimble fingers."
1312,Eliwood: That sounds...like a thief's work...
1313,Hector: Well... Don't let it worry you.
1314,Eliwood: But...
1315,Hector: This journey... I suspect it will be harder than you imagine. You may have to accept things like this if you want to survive.
1316,"Eliwood: What is it, Hector? Do you know something?"
1317,"Hector: Nothing specific. Rumors abound, though. A league of assassins from Bern has been moving around in Lycia. Experienced bounty hunters and mercenaries are vanishing..."
1318,Eliwood: That reminds me. One of the men who attacked us said something odd.
1319,Hector: What was it?
1320,"Marcus: Lord Eliwood, if I may?"
1321,Hector: Marcus! Good to see you!
1322,"Marcus: Lord Hector, it's been far too long. Your assistance is greatly appreciated."
1323,"Hector: Come now, Marcus. No need for such formalities. Tell me what you heard."
1324,Marcus: Of course. The apparent leader of that gang of thugs... He indicated that someone was watching Lord Eliwood... That someone needed him dead.
1325,"Hector: Hmm... That is troubling. Actually, a captain of the guard was watching the fight when we arrived. He was a knight of Santaruz, and yet he just stood there and let a lord be attacked. I think he was planning on seeing you die."
1326,"Eliwood: So, Mark. What do you think? ...You might be right. Something may have happened to Lord Helman, too. Come! We must hurry to the castle!"
1327,Hector: Eliwood! Who is this?
1328,"Eliwood: This is Mark. I required tactical aid in the search for my father, and..."
1329,"Hector: Oh, I see. So this is who direction the battle plan back there, hm? You know, Mark, you're very young. We've many strategists in Ostia, but none so young. Eliwood, are you sure about this one?"
1330,"Eliwood: Mark is still a student of military strategy, but... We've received nothing but sound advice so far. Mark has my trust."
1331,"Hector: All right. I suppose I shall witness your skills firsthand. Well met, Mark."
1332,"Matthew: Hello! How have you been, Mark? Eh? My secret's revealed? Oh, that. Yes, it's true. My guise as a common thief was but a ruse. I've served House Ostia for some time as a spy of sorts! Surprise? Well, regardless, it looks like we'll be traveling together again. Here's to our mutual survival!"
1333,"Serra: Eeeeeeeee! Mark! Is it really you? It's been far, far too long! You missed me, didn't you? Of course you did. I knew it. Hm? Didn't I tell you before? I'm in the employ of Ostia, Lycia's ruling territory. I'll be here to help you just like before! Aren't you lucky!"
1334,"Eliwood enters Santaruz, only to be attacked by a strange group. In a desperate moment, he is rescued by a childhood friend, Marquess Ostia's younger brother, Hector. The assailants' leader reveals that an unknown party seeks Eliwood's head...Eliwood cannot help but think this is related to his father's disappearance. In search of more traces of his father's footsteps, Eliwood sets out for the castle of Lord Helman, the marquess of Santaruz.
"
1335,"Hector rescues Eliwood, and the two friends are reunited. The paladin Marcus reveals news: Someone has called for Eliwood's death. Pherae's problems must be connected to the attempt on Eliwood's life. Searching for more clues, Hector and friends depart for the castle of Marquess Santaruz.
"
1336,Helman: Master Ephidel! What is the meaning of this?
1337,"Ephidel: Peace, Lord Helman. Whatever is wrong?"
1338,Helman: You said you were just going to frighten Eliwood! Your men almost killed him! My patience is at an end! I've decided I must tell Eliwood everything and apologize.
1339,Ephidel: .......You would betray us?
1340,"Helman: I am tired of you and the Black Fang! Now, remove yourself from my castle! Your presence pains me!"
1341,Ephidel: Lord Helman... Is there nothing I can do to change your mind?
1342,Helman: Nothing.
1343,Ephidel: In that case...you're no longer of any use.
1344,Helman: Gaa...urrgh...
1345,"Hector: There's the castle, Eliwood! Hm? Who's there? Show yourself!"
1346,Boies: Pah! Can't believe I was spotted by a snot-nosed stripling...
1347,"Hector: Who are you? No, never mind. Keep your name. Why should I care what a corpse is called?"
1348,"Boies: The cub thinks he's a wolf! Does your bite match your bark? Tell you what. If you make it to the castle alive, we'll find out, eh? Geh heh heh hehhh!"
1349,"Mercenary: Hey, you! Yeah, the new dog! Get this right, or you're gone!"
1350,"Guy: I know, I know. I just got this job! I don't want to lose it!"
1351,"Guy: 'Course, the smart thing to do would have been not to get involved with this ugly bunch. Got to have gold if I want to eat, though. I was too picky before. If I think about the time I passed out in Caelin... Ooooh. Nothing funny about that! That man... What was his name... Matthew? If it hadn't been for him, I would've starved to death..."
1352,Mercenary: What are you mumbling about? Get over here now!
1353,"Guy: Yes, yes, I'm coming! At least I've got work!"
1354,"Lowen: Nice to be working with you, Mark! As a journeyman knight of Pherae, I'm here to serve Lord Eliwood and you, Mark! I await your command!"
1355,"Matthew: Say, Mark. Not sure how to say this... You're a full-blown tactician now, aren't you? Not just an apprentice like before. Ha ha... No need to be so modest. My lord tactician! I humbly await your no-doubt brilliant orders!"
1356,Matthew: Hold on! You! I know you! Isn’t your name Guy?
1357,"Guy: It’s–Is that you, Matthew?"
1358,Matthew: What a pleasant surprise! How’s your swordwork coming?
1359,"Guy: You are aware this isn’t the best place to be catching up, aren’t you? You and I…We’re on opposite sides here."
1360,Matthew: What? Are you saying you’re going to fight me?
1361,"Guy: I…Well, yeah. I’m much improved. You can’t beat me."
1362,"Matthew: You’re quite a terror, Guy. Well then… Hold on! I’d prefer it if you repaid what you owe me."
1363,Guy: Huh?
1364,"Matthew: Last time I saw you, I gave you food.  If I remember correctly, you said you owed me your life."
1365,"Guy: I only said that ’cause you said you’d feed me if I did! I hadn’t eaten in ten days, and you were cooking meat! You… This… This isn’t fair!"
1366,"Matthew: The people of Sacae never lie. Isn’t that right, Guy?"
1367,"Guy: Grrr… Fine! I finally find work, and now I have to throw it away! This is all your fault!"
1368,"Boies: What’s this? You’ve made it this far? Ah, I paid too much for that worthless pack of sellswords!"
1369,"Boies: You’ve beaten me…but you’re too late to save him… Too…too bad, eh, laddie? Geha ha…geha!"
1370,Eliwood: Lord Helman!!
1371,Helman: … Is that you…Eliwood?
1372,"Eliwood: Hold on, my lord!"
1373,Helman: I… I must apologize… Your father… He…
1374,"Eliwood: Do you know something, sir?"
1375,Helman: I… … If I hadn’t told Elbert…about…Darin’s plans…This would…never…have…Cough cough…
1376,Eliwood: Lord Helman!
1377,Helman: …..Go to Laus…Darin…the marquess of Laus…knows all.
1378,Eliwood: Marquess Laus?
1379,"Helman: I’m sorry, Eliwood…I…I can’t…"
1380,Eliwood: Hold on!
1381,Helman: Beware…the Black…Fang………
1382,Eliwood: Lord Helman!
1383,Hector: He’s gone…
1384,Eliwood: It can’t be…Lord Helman…Why……Why did this happen?
1385,Hector: Blast! What is going on?!?
1386,"Eliwood: …..We go to Laus. We must speak to the marquess of Laus, Lord Darin."
1387,"Hector: You’re right. We should leave quickly. I’m not sure how far we can get today, but…I can’t sit still."
1388,Servant: Pardon me…
1389,Hector: Hm?
1390,Servant: If I may?
1391,Eliwood: Who are you?
1392,"Servant: I’m the steward of Santaruz. With our lord gone, what are we to do?"
1393,"Hector: First, you give Lord Helman a proper burial. After that…I’m sure the Lycian Council will have to meet. Stay here and defend the castle until you hear more."
1394,Servant: I understand.
1395,Eliwood: Let’s go. We must keep moving.
1396,"Hector: Yes…and now we seek answers for Marquess Santaruz, too."
1397,Eliwood: …Lord Helman…May you find peace.
1398,Hector: Bah! Dark already.
1399,"Eliwood: We'll have to stop here for the night. We'll set out for Laus at the first sign of sunlight. Marcus, prepare the camp."
1400,"Marcus: Yes, my lord."
1401,Hector: So this is Caelin? You think we ought to present ourselves to Lord Hausen?
1402,"Eliwood: We're simply passing through, so I don't see the need. I am curious how Lyndis is getting along, though."
1403,Hector: Lyndis?
1404,Eliwood: Marquess Caelin's granddaughter.
1405,"Hector: Oh, her. The missing heir who dealt with Lundgren last year. Didn't you have something to do with that?"
1406,Eliwood: Mm.
1407,Hector: And? The granddaughter? Is she a beauty?
1408,Eliwood: A beauty? She's... I don't...she's... I think it must be her Sacae heritage. She's...striking...
1409,"Hector: Striking? Too bad, isn't it?"
1410,Eliwood: What?
1411,"Hector: That we don't have time to see her, loverboy."
1412,Eliwood: No! Lyndis and I are... We're not...
1413,Hector: You're not? Then why are you getting so worked up?
1414,Eliwood: Hector! Don't make me angry!
1415,Hector: Ha ha ha ha! You are so much fun to tease! Huh? What was that? Did you hear something?
1416,Eliwood: It was a scream. Someone's being attacked!
1417,Hector: Do we help?
1418,Eliwood: Of course!
1419,Merlinus: Oh noooooo! Someone! Help!!!
1420,Bandit: Grrr! Stupid old fool! He's kept us running in circles for hours!
1421,Merlinus: My... My valuable merchandise! What are you going to do?
1422,"Puzon: Hey, look at this. The old fool's wealthy."
1423,"Bandit: Huh huh huh. Our lucky day. Eh, Puzon?"
1424,Merlinus: Let go! Let go!! Will you let go!!!
1425,"Bandit: What a racket! Puzon, can we get rid of this simpleton?"
1426,Puzon: I suppose so. There's no reason to let him live.
1427,Merlinus: Oh my!! Eeeyaaaaahhh!
1428,Eliwood: Release him!
1429,Puzon: Who--
1430,Eliwood: I told you to let the man go!
1431,"Hector: If you move quickly, we'll let you live."
1432,"Puzon: Ha! A pair of dandies like you? You know what I think? Living off your parents' names, prancing about... I despise you! Come on! Don't hold back! We'll kill you all!"
1433,Merlinus: Oh noooooo! Someone! Help!!!
1434,Bandit: Grrr! Stupid old fool! He's kept us running in circles for hours!
1435,Merlinus: My... My valuable merchandise! What are you going to do?
1436,"Puzon: Hey, look at this. The old fool's wealthy."
1437,"Bandit: Huh huh huh. Our lucky day. Eh, Puzon?"
1438,Merlinus: Let go! Let go!! Will you let go!!!
1439,"Bandit: What a racket! Puzon, can we get rid of this simpleton?"
1440,Puzon: I suppose so. There's no reason to let him live.
1441,Merlinus: Oh my!! Eeeyaaaaahhh!
1442,Hector: Hold! Release that man!
1443,Puzon: What?
1444,"Hector: We're not after you, dullard. We want the old man and his goods. If you value your life, you'll leave now."
1445,Puzon: What did you say? Who do you think you are? Do you think you can walk away with our spoils?
1446,Hector: You half-wit! Do we look like thieves to you?
1447,Puzon: We'll not let our profit be snatched away so easily! Come! To me now! Hold nothing back! Kill 'em all!
1448,"Merlinus: Aaaiiieeee!!! You! They call you Mark, am I right? I am Merlinus, a humble and lowly merchant. I know nothing of combat. Please! You must protect me!"
1449,Bandit: Oof… Blast! I won’t forget this!
1450,Hector: Then you’re smarter than you look! Get out of here!!
1451,Eliwood: Are you all right?
1452,Merlinus: Hm? Oho!! I… I’ve been saved!
1453,Eliwood: We’ve driven them off. Are you injured?
1454,"Merlinus: No, not at all. As you can see, I’m as fine as fine can be."
1455,"Eliwood: I’m glad to see that. Good day, sir. Hector."
1456,"Merlinus: Wait a moment, please! A token of my thanks…"
1457,Eliwood: Do not worry yourself. We did nothing to merit reward.
1458,Hector: That’s right. We’ve no need of a peddler’s junk.
1459,Merlinus: P-P-Peddler?
1460,Eliwood: Hector!
1461,Hector: Oops!
1462,Merlinus: Ahem! I am Merlinus. You’ll find no other traveling merchant whose goods compare. Don’t let your eyes fool you: I’m quite prosperous.
1463,"Hector: Huh? You’re a merchant? Books and knives and all that, eh?"
1464,"Eliwood: Hector, your manners are terrible. Merlinus, please… Pay no mind to what this oaf has to say."
1465,"Merlinus: No, of course not. I wasn’t concerned at… Ahem! By the way, you two obviously come from highborn houses. Would you grant me the honor of your names?"
1466,"Eliwood: I am Eliwood, son of the marquess of Pherae."
1467,Hector: I’m Hector. Marquess Ostia’s brother.
1468,Merlinus: Goodness! Ostia! Pherae! The greatest houses in all of Lycia!! Ahh… To be saved by noblemen such as yourselves… It is an honor beyond words!
1469,"Hector: It’s nice to be appreciated for a change. Lately, people just seem to want us dead. Tell me, Merlinus, what are your plans?"
1470,"Merlinus: Pardon? My plans, my lord? I had planned to travel Lycia selling my merchandise, but… It may not be possible in such dangerous times."
1471,"Hector: If that’s the case, why don’t you come along with us?"
1472,Eliwood: Hector?
1473,"Hector: Our travels will not be ending anytime soon. We’ve gained more people and more items, right? It might be good to have help managing our things."
1474,"Merlinus: Oho! Now THAT is a splendid idea! Managing merchandise is my specialty, after all!"
1475,Eliwood: Are you sure?
1476,"Merlinus: Quite sure, my lord. To be honest, I’ve dreamt of working for a noble house. To have my fondest wish granted in such a way… I cannot stem these tears of joy! Lord Hector! Lord Eliwood!!! Take me into your bosoms and keep me safe forever!"
1477,"Eliwood: Uh… Thank you. Well met, Merlinus."
1478,"Hector: We’re counting on you! Now, I’ve got some things I want you to carry…"
1479,"Merlinus: Yes, of course. Whatever you have, Merlinus will keep!"
1480,"A droll merchant named Merlinus now joins Eliwood's group. With Merlinus in tow, they set out for Laus the following day. Laus is located in the heart of Lycia, a territory ruled by the power-hungry marquess of Laus, Lord Darin. Preparations for the war of which the Pheraen magistrate spoke...The disappearance of Eliwood's father, Elbert...The death of Marquess Santaruz...Do these all revolve around Lord Darin? In Eliwood's heart, the need for truth is drowned in fear...A fear of what that truth may hold.
"
1481,"Laus is located in the heart of Lycia, a territory ruled by the power-hungry marquess of Laus, Lord Darin. Preparations for the war of which the Pheraen magistrate spoke...The disappearance of Eliwood's father, Elbert...The death of Marquess Santaruz...Do these all revolve around Lord Darin? In Eliwood's heart, the need for truth is drowned in fear...A fear of what that truth may hold.
"
1482,Darin: Are you certain? Pherae’s heir is here?
1483,"Erik: Yes, Father. We’ve just received word from our lookouts. He’s still beyond that hill, but he’ll be here before long."
1484,"Darin: Lord Ephidel, what is the meaning of this?"
1485,"Ephidel: Perhaps when they reached Santaruz Castle, Lord Helman was still clinging to life."
1486,Darin: You can’t be serious!
1487,"Ephidel: He couldn’t have lasted too long, but…maybe he told them something."
1488,"Darin: That’s terrible! Our plan! It’s all for naught, isn’t it?"
1489,"Ephidel: No need to be so alarmed, my lord. Even if he told young Eliwood something of our schemes, Pherae no longer has any power. All Eliwood could do is perhaps inform Marquess Ostia."
1490,"Darin: Ostia?! That would be ruinous! Lord Uther may be young and new to the throne, but he’s dangerous. That addlepated Helman! He was a coward to the end! To betray us now, when we’re so close…We only need a little more time to complete our plans for rebellion!"
1491,"Ephidel: Then before Marquess Ostia becomes aware of any of this, you would do well to stop them here."
1492,"Darin: Yes, you’re right, of course. We do have a chance! They have to pass through Laus to get to Ostia. We can still silence them!"
1493,Ephidel: They must not pass. No matter the cost.
1494,Darin: Let us make haste. Call up our finest troops.
1495,"Erik: Father! Please, let me take the command."
1496,"Darin: Erik! Tell me, Son, can you succeed?"
1497,"Erik: That clod Eliwood and I studied together in Ostia. He’s a trusting fool. If he sees me, he’ll lower his guard. And when he does, we strike!"
1498,Darin: I see.
1499,"Ephidel: I beg your pardon… Is this not too much for him? If, by strange chance, he fell, things could turn for the worse."
1500,"Darin: No, I know I’m the lad’s father, but Erik’s quite clever, I tell you. Snuffing Pherae’s whelp will be no trouble at all. It’s settled! It’s up to you now, Erik. Bring me the head of Pherae’s darling son!"
1501,"Erik: Yes, Father! I will not fail you!"
1502,Hector: Look around… They truly are preparing for battle. Marquess Laus! What is he scheming?
1503,Eliwood: ….
1504,Hector: You don’t much look like you want to go to the castle.
1505,"Eliwood: If we go and learn the truth, we may have to go to war."
1506,Hector: That’s fine with me!
1507,"Eliwood: I… I’ve no love for war. If I concentrate on the foe before me, I’m fine. If I picture families, innocents caught up in our foolish politics? If I imagine them… All I can do is pray for a way to solve things peacefully."
1508,Hector: Eliwood….
1509,Marcus: Lord Eliwood! A knight has ridden forth from the castle.
1510,Eliwood: A lone knight?
1511,"Marcus: Yes, my lord. Our scouts say it’s Marquess Laus’s son, Erik. He is asking to see you."
1512,Eliwood: Erik?
1513,Hector: Gah. Why did it have to be that buffoon?
1514,Eliwood: I will see him. Bring him here.
1515,Hector: I’m leaving. I never could abide him. I’ll go for a ride and survey our surroundings.
1516,"Oswin: Good day, Lord Hector. Is Lord Eliwood with you?"
1517,"Hector: No. He's treating with Marquess Laus's son, Erik."
1518,Oswin: Is it wise for you to be away at this time?
1519,Hector: Erik's a contemptuous peacock. He's intolerable. And he made a show of riding from the castle alone. Something feels odd.
1520,"Oswin: That is unusual. I've been thinking, my lord... Laus is blessed with clear water and fertile ground. See the shade its tall trees and grasses cast? Ideal for hiding soldiers, don't you think?"
1521,"Hector: You're right, Oswin. I'm going to take a look around."
1522,"Oswin: Very good. Let's split up and double our ground. One thing, my lord!"
1523,Hector: What is it?
1524,Oswin: Do not let yourself be distracted. Keep your guard up.
1525,"Hector: Ha ha ha. Yes, Mother. I will."
1526,"Erik: Hello! It’s been a long time, Eliwood!"
1527,Eliwood: Erik… What is your business?
1528,Erik: My business? What do you mean? I heard my old friend was here in Laus. I merely thought I’d ride out to greet you!
1529,Eliwood: ……
1530,"Erik: So tell me, friend, what brings you to Laus? Are you…on your way to Ostia?"
1531,Eliwood: Hm? Why would you think that?
1532,"Erik: Well, you were always such good friends with Hector. He and I never… got along very well. For a noble, his behavior was crude, and his manner of speech… You would have thought him a peasant at first glance. You’re still friends with Hector, aren’t you? When did you see him last? How do you communicate?"
1533,Eliwood: Erik… You’re after something. What is it?
1534,Erik: Pardon?
1535,"Eliwood: Everywhere I look, Laus prepares for battle. What are you and your father planning? I will know the truth!"
1536,Erik: Hm… I’d hoped to wait until you’d told me of Ostia. Of whether you’ve spoken with the marquess or not.
1537,Eliwood: What are you talking about?
1538,"Erik: Hm heh heh… Eliwood, I have always despised you. How I’ve longed to smash you and your pathetic morality into pieces! I’ve dreamed of this day, and here it is at last!"
1539,Hector: Too bad you’ll not live to see the end of it.
1540,Eliwood: Hector!
1541,Erik: Y-You! Hector! You couldn’t… Have you spoken with Ostia already?
1542,"Hector: Maybe we have, maybe we haven’t. Eliwood, this mongrel has troops lying in ambush all around us. Laus regulars, every one. We’re in for a rough time."
1543,"Erik: Heh heh… There’s little point in fighting. You’re trapped! My forces will overwhelm you, an unending torrent of soldiers! Laus’s elite knights are at the ready as well. Heh heh… How long do you think you can survive?"
1544,Eliwood: Craven cur!
1545,"Hannah: Hee hee hee... A world of trouble you've landed yourself in, yes?"
1546,"Hector: Who--!? You startled me, old woman! You should get out of here. This is going to be a bad place to stay if you plan on living."
1547,Hannah: I want to see the one searching for his father. Marquess Pherae's son.
1548,"Hector: Listen up, old woman! You're close to death as it is! Quit your yammering and move on!"
1549,"Eliwood: Hector! You should mind your manners. I am Eliwood. May I ask your name, milady?"
1550,"Hannah: Ho ho ho. What a polite young man. I'm Hannah, a fortune-teller. I came here to help you."
1551,Eliwood: Can you tell me where my father's gone?
1552,"Hannah: No...but... I can see other things...useful things... I can tell you what weapons to take into battle, as well as who should wield them. Things of that nature."
1553,Eliwood: I see...
1554,Hector: Don't tell me you believe any of this.
1555,Eliwood: I have no reason to believe or disbelieve in Hannah's powers. But I'll not rule out anything if it helps me find my father.
1556,"Merlinus: Lord Eliwood! Lord Hector! I make my living as a humble merchant. If you have any items you no longer need, please let poor Merlinus take them."
1557,"Hannah: Heh heh heh. I'm here, too. Speak to me for auguries before you engage the enemy. My services are not free, but they may save you from paying a greater price!"
1558,"Merlinus: Lord Eliwood, shall I join you? If you deploy my tent, I can help with equipment. I can switch items for you and hold them if your packs are full. However, my tent cannot be moved about, so if you deploy it, it will require a guard. I beg your understanding."
1559,"Narrator: Merlinus’s merchant tent can be deployed on this map. If you deploy the tent, any items you cannot carry can be sent to the tent. However, the tent is vulnerable to enemy attack. If the tent loses all its HP, it will vanish from the map and remain unavailable until the next map. Merlinus’s tent gains one level for every battle it survives. The tent will be harder to destroy as it increases in level."
1560,"Marcus: Mark! Let me take the point. There may be many of them, but numbers are meaningless! We are knights of Pherae. These mice of Laus will never defeat us!"
1561,"Serra: Uh-oh! I think we've been surrounded! Uh... but I'm not worried a bit. I'm with you after all, Mark. We make quite a team. Right. Come on, Mark! Let's get started!"
1562,Erk: Hm. We certainly could stand some assistance…
1563,"Man: I’m sorry, but it’s just not possible. If we disobey Marquess Laus, who knows what might happen to us?"
1564,Erk: I understand. We’ll seek our aid elsewhere.
1565,"Man: You’ll find the same answer everywhere you go. Eventually, you’ll have to do as the marquess orders. You would do well to tell your employer the same thing."
1566,Erk: Hm. Good day to you.
1567,"Bandit: Eh? What’s all this? Looks like a war’s broken out. Aha ha ha! Perfect! Time for a raid! Up and at ’em, mates! That village is ripe for plunder!"
1568,Man: Priscilla. Has your escort returned yet?
1569,Priscilla: No. He left yesterday in search of a way out of here… I just hope the soldiers of Laus haven’t captured him.
1570,"Man: His search for help must have been fruitless. Marquess Laus has ordered that no aid be given to you. There’s really nothing that any of us can do. I apologize, but…"
1571,"Priscilla: No, no. You could turn me over to the marquess, and yet you continue to grant me asylum. I’m grateful for that. Of course, if I simply went to the castle, this would all be over."
1572,"Man: Don’t fret over that. None of us are overly fond of the marquess. He’s always threatening us. He treats us like slaves. All of these war preparations? We want nothing to do with them. We may be divided into territories, but we’re Lycians one and all. We may be invaded by another country one day, but why does he want to start a war here at home? None of us understand what he is doing."
1573,"Erik: Blast! They’re stronger than I had supposed! To the castle! I want all the reinforcements available, and I want them now!"
1574,Soldier: Lord Erik is struggling! He requests reinforcements!
1575,Darin: What? Ready the men.
1576,Ephidel: Unbelievable… These numbers cannot stop them.
1577,Darin: Ephidel? W-Where are you going?
1578,Ephidel: It seems that conquering Lycia might have been too much to ask of you after all. I must inform my master. The Black Fang will be leaving at once.
1579,Darin: No! You… You can’t abandon us! Not at this stage!
1580,"Ephidel: Who was it that said Ostia mustn’t learn of our plans? Wasn’t it you, Lord Darin? The marquess of Laus himself?"
1581,"Darin: Y-Yes, it was. There’s no turning back for me. Not now! P-P-Please! One more… Give me one more chance. I assure you, I will not disappoint Lord Nergal!"
1582,Ephidel: Very well… Assemble your men. We will regroup elsewhere.
1583,Darin: Eh? You can’t mean… My son…my home… Am I to abandon them?
1584,"Ephidel: Would you fall in disgrace along with your son? Our master, Lord Nergal, is offering you the throne of all Lycia…Surely a few sacrifices are not too much to ask?"
1585,Darin: Yes… You’re right. My destiny is greater than this. I was born to be king of Lycia.
1586,"Ephidel: And as for an heir? You’re still young, my lord. You will have time. You must not let a moment’s sentimentality cloud your judgment."
1587,Darin: ……
1588,Erik: Where are my reinforcements? Why haven’t they come? I’ve no choice. I must attack! You! To the castle! Find more men!
1589,"Soldier: Yes, my lord!"
1590,Serra: Ohmigosh! It’s Erk! It’s been SO long! What are you doing here?
1591,Erk: Oh… Serra. You’re the last person I wanted to see…
1592,"Serra:: Oh, that’s so sweet! You wanted to see me again!"
1593,Erk: ……
1594,"Serra: Hey, I know! This is perfect. Come with us and lend a hand, Erk."
1595,Erk: I beg your pardon?
1596,Serra: Come on! I’ll even introduce you to Lords Hector and Eliwood! I know you. You’re probably just wandering about without work.
1597,"Erk: No, Serra. I’m afraid I am gainfully employed. However… If you’re fighting Laus… This might work out after all."
1598,"Serra: What are you babbling about? Make up your mind, will you?"
1599,"Erk: My employer is hiding in a village south of here. If you’ll help me protect her, I’ll join up with you."
1600,Erk: Lady Priscilla! I’m glad to see you well.
1601,Priscilla: Erk! Have you joined Lord Eliwood’s company as well?
1602,Erk: Yes. Traveling with them seems to be the safest way for us to continue your search for your family.
1603,Priscilla: Erk!
1604,"Erk: Oh, my apologies. This isn’t the place to discuss such things."
1605,"Priscilla: I’m sorry, but…"
1606,"Erk: Lady Priscilla, my teacher entrusted you to my care. Until you have reached your goal, I will not leave your side."
1607,"Priscilla: Thank you, Erk."
1608,"Man: You’re battling Erik and his men, right? Let me tell you, I’m on your side! My granddaughter… Marquess Laus took her away. He found her pretty, and forced her to the castle. It’s not much, but please take this. It’s a large sword, so you have to be strong to use it. It’s a bit unwieldy, but it is a mighty weapon nonetheless. I hope you can defeat the marquess’s son, Erik. It would make our lives more pleasant. Good luck to you."
1609,"Priscilla: Again? Are you another messenger from the marquess? Please, do not waste your time. I will not change my decision. Pardon? Marquess Laus did not send you? I… I beg your forgiveness. It was my mistake. Say… If it’s not too much trouble, might I leave with you? I’m on a journey. Marquess Laus is barring my way, and…I’m trapped. I am trained in the use of staves. Please, help me."
1610,Erk: Lady Priscilla! Are you well?
1611,"Priscilla: I should be asking you that, Erk. Have you been wounded?"
1612,"Erk: I’m fine. Listen, my lady. I’ve found some friends who will help us."
1613,Priscilla: Truly?
1614,Erk: We’ll be joining up with Marquess Pherae’s son. Traveling with them seems to be the safest way for us to continue your search for your family.
1615,Priscilla: Erk!
1616,"Erk: Oh, my apologies. This isn’t the place to discuss such things."
1617,"Priscilla: I’m sorry, but…"
1618,"Erk: Lady Priscilla, my teacher entrusted you to my care. Until you have reached your goal, I will not leave your side."
1619,"Priscilla: Thank you, Erk."
1620,Erik: Laus is the true throne of Lycia! Taste my lance!
1621,Erik: I am no one’s prisoner! Unhand me! Gwaaa!
1622,"Hector: Come on, Erik! Get up!"
1623,Erik: You… You peasants… You can’t treat a proper noble like this!
1624,Hector: It’s too late for niceties! Be thankful you’re still breathing!
1625,"Eliwood: Erik, you must tell me. Where is your father? We’ve searched the entire castle, and there’s no one here."
1626,Erik: D-Don’t be ridiculous! My father would not abandon… No! He’d never… Ephidel…
1627,Eliwood: Ephidel? Who’s that?
1628,Erik: ……
1629,"Hector: Speak, cur!! Do you want to die here?"
1630,Erik: Ah!
1631,Eliwood: Hector! Erik…please. You must tell us everything you know. I… I just want to know where my father is.
1632,Erik: ………Ephidel… He appeared at the castle one year ago. He came…and my father changed. Ostia’s position had always bothered my father… He felt Laus deserved to rule all of Lycia. But he’d never gone so far as to speak of rebellion.
1633,Hector: Did you say…rebellion?
1634,"Erik: Ephidel had something… With it, he convinced my father to set this plan in motion. My father then sent envoys to several other marquesses. Marquess Pherae, he had approved of the idea."
1635,Hector: What?
1636,Eliwood: Never! My father would never agree to such a thing!
1637,Erik: Believe or disbelieve. That is your choice. First was Marquess Santaruz. Then Marquess Pherae’s reply arrived. Marquess Pherae visited here six months ago to seal his approval.
1638,Eliwood: That’s not… possible…
1639,"Erik: My father and yours argued vehemently that day. Marquess Pherae always distrusted Ephidel. He tried to convince my father to send Ephidel and the Black Fang assassins out of Lycia. My father would not be persuaded, and Marquess Pherae left the castle. As you know, he then disappeared. I doubt he’s still alive."
1640,Eliwood: No!
1641,Hector: Shut your mouth!
1642,Erik: Eliwood said he wanted to hear everything. My father… He is but Ephidel’s puppet. He’ll listen to anything that villain says. Even watch his own son…die…… Those are the sort of people you’re dealing with. Marquess Pherae betrayed them. They would not let him live! Ha ha…ha ha ha ha ha ha…
1643,Eliwood: Ah…
1644,Hector: Wait! Eliwood!
1645,Oswin: Lord Hector.
1646,Hector: Oswin! Did Eliwood pass this way?
1647,Oswin: Lord Eliwood? He ran through that gate and went outside.
1648,Hector: I see.
1649,"Oswin: Lord Hector! A moment, please."
1650,"Hector: What is it, Oswin."
1651,"Oswin: Let us return to Ostia. The rumors... I've heard that... Lord Hector, I cannot approve of helping Eliwood...or Pherae...any longer."
1652,Hector: What are you saying?
1653,Oswin: We must think of Ostia's well-being. If Marquess Pherae was involved in a rebellion--
1654,Hector: Oswin. You will take back those words.
1655,"Oswin: Lord Hector, I appreciate your feelings..."
1656,Hector: I know Eliwood's father very well. I'm telling you that he is a man worthy of our trust. You are in my service! Do you not feel you should follow my orders?
1657,Oswin: .......
1658,"Hector: Heed my words, Oswin. You are my brother's vassal. Your duties to guard me come second to this. Return to Ostia, Oswin. You've done your duty. ........Thank you."
1659,Oswin: .......My remarks about Marquess Pherae were improper. I apologize completely.
1660,Hector: Oswin? Stop! That's enough! You need not bend your knee to me!
1661,"Oswin: My lord, I would swear my service to you."
1662,Hector: Service...to me?
1663,Oswin: Please accept my lance as your own. Then return it with your blessings.
1664,"Hector: Oswin, you--"
1665,"Oswin: I am a knight in service to Castle Ostia. Until now, I have only offered my lance to Lord Uther. Yet... I now wish to offer you that same service. Please grant me that honor."
1666,Hector: Oswin...
1667,Hector: Eliwood…
1668,Eliwood: My father is alive… And… I cannot believe he supports…rebellion. There must be… There has to be a reason…
1669,"Hector: I know. I don’t believe any of this for an instant. My brother trusted Marquess Pherae more than anyone. First, we’ll find your father and uncover the truth. We’ll talk to my brother after that."
1670,"Eliwood: Hector, I’m sorry…"
1671,Hector: Don’t look like that. Your father is surely alive. Right?
1672,"Eliwood: Yes, of course… Marquess Laus… Black Fang assassins… Now this mysterious Ephidel… I’ll find them all and prove my father’s innocence!"
1673,"In Laus, Erik tells Eliwood of a plan. A plot to use Laus as starting ground in a rebellion against Ostia. Eliwood needs proof to believe these accusations, and so he and his allies pursue Darin, the fleeing marquess of Laus. Where that chase would lead, Eliwood could not have known.
"
1674,"After repelling the mercenary forces of Eubans, Hector prepares to mount a pursuit of Marquess Laus. Lord Darin and his knights are with the instigator of the rebellion, the enigmatic Ephidel. Hector learns where the fugitives were traveling from Ostia’s network of spies. However, their final destination still remains unknown…
"
1675,Hector: Blast! Where on earth has that snake Darin gone?
1676,"Eliwood: I doubt he’s left Lycia yet, but… Hector…it’s been five days. The death of Marquess Santaruz… Our attack on Laus Castle… Word of these things must have reached Lord Uther by now. And yet he shows no sign of action… Why?"
1677,Hector: I’m sure he has his reasons. My brother has other concerns tying his hands right now.
1678,Eliwood: What do you mean?
1679,"Hector: It’s Bern. We’ve received disturbing reports over the past few months. King Desmond is behaving oddly. If he sees even the slightest crack in Lycia’s defenses, we believe he’ll invade with all of Bern’s might behind him. My brother has only recently become marquess, as well as head of the Lycian League. He can’t allow another country to see weakness or discord."
1680,"Eliwood: He has to present the face of stability and strength, is that it?"
1681,"Hector: Yes. It seems every country has a spy working in Ostia right now. They all want to assess the new marquess’s temperament and skill. If they sense anything wrong, word will spread like wildfire."
1682,"Eliwood: Hector, you’re the marquess’s brother… Would not being at his side be seen as something “wrong”?"
1683,"Hector: The marquess’s brother is a well-known lout. If I WERE at court, they’d sense something wrong."
1684,"Eliwood: You’re not too proud of that reputation, are you?"
1685,Hector: Not in the least.
1686,Oswin: Lord Hector! Lord Eliwood!
1687,"Hector: What is it, Oswin? Have you heard something?"
1688,"Oswin: Yes, my lord. A messenger from the east! Castle Caelin has fallen to a surprise attack from Marquess Laus!"
1689,Eliwood: Castle Caelin!?
1690,Hector: They’ve struck again.
1691,Eliwood: Lord Hausen… Is he unharmed?
1692,"Oswin: My apologies, my lord… We’ve no word on Lord Hausen or his granddaughter, the lady Lyndis."
1693,Eliwood: I never imagined they would attack Caelin… Lord Hausen… Lyndis…
1694,Oswin: Lord Hector… What should we do?
1695,"Hector: They might still be alive, right? There’s only one thing we can do!"
1696,Eliwood: Hector!
1697,Hector: Come on! We’ve got to hurry!
1698,"Kent: Milady, I’ve returned, and I have brought news. Laus soldiers are scattered from the castle to the edge of this forest. There must be at least 50 soldiers!"
1699,"Sain: Are you sure about this, milady? We barely escaped… Going back to the castle would mean almost certain death."
1700,"Lyn: My grandfather is in the castle. I left the castle on his orders, but… I can’t leave him in there alone!"
1701,Wil: The numbers we face… Rescuing Lord Hausen will be no easy task.
1702,Sain: I wonder if we can expect any reinforcements.
1703,Kent: I overheard some of the Laus soldiers talking. They claim that Lord Eliwood invaded Laus and drove them out.
1704,Lyn: Eliwood? Why would he attack Laus?
1705,"Kent: It gets even more interesting… Not only did Marquess Laus abandon his castle, but he also left his son, Erik, behind when he fled here to Caelin."
1706,Sain: That’s despicable! He abandoned his own son?
1707,Lyn: But at least we know Eliwood is in Laus. We might be able to ask him for help. …Assuming there were a way to contact him.
1708,"Wil: If we are to avoid being caught, the best path would be through the forest. Shall I go?"
1709,"Lyn: I suspect you’re right. Horses cannot move well in woods… It’ll take you a while, but you can travel lightly…"
1710,Florina: Lady Lyndis! I’ll go! I can fly above the forest. I can be in Laus faster than anyone else.
1711,Lyn: Florina? You can’t do this on your own! It’s not possible!
1712,"Florina: Thanks to my time here, I’m no longer as timid around men as I used to be. And I’ve met Lord Eliwood before. I’m sure I can do this on my own."
1713,"Lyn: It will be terribly dangerous… You understand, don’t you?"
1714,Florina: Yes. But… I promised myself I would become braver for you. I’m not the weak little Florina I used to be. I’ll be fine. Trust me.
1715,"Lyn: You’ve convinced me. The job’s yours, Florina. But you must promise me that you won’t try anything impossible!"
1716,"Florina: Yes, my lady. Farewell!"
1717,Sain: Did you hear our meek Florina? She sounded most forceful! Beautiful!
1718,Kent: She’s become a full-fledged pegasus knight.
1719,"Lyn: Yes, she has."
1720,"Wil: All for you, Lady Lyndis. That’s quite gallant."
1721,"Lyn: When we lived on the plains, I was always her protector. I know I shouldn’t feel sad, and yet…"
1722,Soldier: Commander Bauker! There’s something in the southern skies.
1723,Bauker: Is that…a pegasus knight? Where do you suppose she’s going? It doesn’t matter. We’ve been told not to let anyone out of Caelin. Archers! Advance! Bring her down!
1724,"Florina: To reach Laus, I must go over the forest…and fly north. Then, I’ll have to… Wait! Who are those people? They fly no banner, and yet… Ah! That man in the lead! It’s Lord Eliwood! He’s come to Caelin’s aid! That’s wonderful. I have to tell him where Lady Lyndis is waiting!"
1725,Hector: I’ve spotted the enemy… Why are their archers advancing? They’re aiming at something up high.”
1726,"Marcus: Lord Eliwood, look! Up there! A pegasus knight!"
1727,Florina: Lord Eliwood!
1728,"Eliwood: Could it really be… Florina, is that you?"
1729,Florina: Yes! I’m Lady Lyndis’s…
1730,Eliwood: Florina! Fly lower!
1731,Florina: Wha–Oh! Aaaaaaah!!!
1732,Eliwood: Florina!!!
1733,Hector: Oooh!
1734,Florina: …… Ah…
1735,Eliwood: Can you hear me? Florina?
1736,Florina: Lord Eliwood?… I…
1737,"Eliwood: Those archers almost hit you. You avoided the arrows, but you lost your balance and fell."
1738,Florina: And yet… I’m not hurt. I fell from such a height. What–
1739,Hector: You got lucky. I didn’t. You landed right on top of me!
1740,Florina: Oh!
1741,Eliwood: Hector saved you.
1742,Hector: I saved no one! I simply gave her someplace soft to land! A bale of hay could have done more than I did.
1743,"Florina: Eeek! Oh… Oh, I’m so sorry!"
1744,"Eliwood: You were lucky, Florina. If you had fallen on me, I couldn’t have caught you. Or your pegasus either!"
1745,Hector: They fell one after the other! I couldn’t get out of the way!
1746,"Florina: M-M-My pegasus, too? I am so… I’m truly… I don’t know what to say! I…um… I……"
1747,"Hector: No apology needed. You do need to tell us why you’re here, however."
1748,"Florina: Yes, of… of course! Lord Eliwood, Lady Lyndis is beyond that forest. She’s waiting for a chance to assault the castle."
1749,"Eliwood: She’s what!? Ah… Still, it’s good to hear she’s safe."
1750,"Florina: She’s fine. However, Lord Hausen’s been captured. He’s still in the castle."
1751,Eliwood: I see. Let’s go then!
1752,"Bauker: Someone get up there and scour the area! I want to know if we brought down that pegasus knight! If she’s still breathing, make her stop!"
1753,"Soldier: My lord! To the west! We’re under attack! It’s the Pheraen noble, Eliwood!"
1754,"Bauker: He’s here, eh? Now’s our chance to show Marquess Laus our loyalty. Our opponents are a motley band of fools! They’re no match for us!"
1755,"Erk: Pherae's new tactician... It was you all along, wasn't it, Mark? Me? I'm still traveling in pursuit of knowledge. I'll never outstrip my tutor, but I'm getting a bit closer... Well, Mark, tell me what you need me to do."
1756,Florina: Uh... Mark... Um... It's me... Florina. Um... I'm... I'm over here.
1757,Eliwood: Lyn!
1758,Lyn: Eliwood?! You came here?
1759,Eliwood: Florina told us where you were. We're here to help.
1760,Lyn: Thank you!
1761,"Lyn: Are you an ally, too?"
1762,"Hector: Yep, that's what it looks like."
1763,"Lyn: In that case, I have something to tell you."
1764,Hector: We're a bit busy now. Save it for later.
1765,Lyn: What? Hold on! Wait just a minute!
1766,"Florina: Whew…I’m sorry, Makar. You must be all tired out from all the flying we’ve done. You need some water. That’s a good boy."
1767,"Hector: Hey, you! You’re in the way! Move!!!"
1768,Florina: Kyaaaa!
1769,Hector: This is a battlefield! It’s not a stable! I’m not picking you up if you get shot down again!
1770,"Florina: Oh…uhm… Excuse me…it’s… Lord Hector, isn’t it? I…well…it’s…"
1771,"Hector: Oh, hey! Eliwood! It’s the…"
1772,Florina: Ah…
1773,Lyn: Hey you! You're ...
1774,Matthew: Um... No I'm not. You've got the wrong fellow... Bye now!
1775,Lyn: Stop right there Matthew!
1776,"Matthew: Saw right through my disguise, didn't you lady Lyndis?"
1777,Lyn: What are you talking about? How could I not recognise you? You're... You!
1778,"Matthew: Yes, but I had to at least try to fool you. Being memorable is not the best quality for a spy to have."
1779,Lyn: Spy? I thought you were a thief!
1780,Matthew: Oops!
1781,"Lyn: What's this about? Come on, tell me!"
1782,Matthew: I can't it's a secret.
1783,Lyn: A secret? Would you have your mouth sealed if you spoke it?
1784,Matthew: You're very knowledgeable!
1785,"Lyn: Very well, I'll ask no more questions. If you have any trouble, though, you can talk to me. I'm sure I'll be able to help. (Leaves)"
1786,"Matthew: Ahhh, Lady Lyndis? I believe you are the one currently in trouble. You're either generous to a fault or something altogether."
1787,Serra: Ah! Lyn! I'm so happy to see you safe!
1788,Lyn: Serra! What are you doing in Caelin?
1789,Serra: I'm with Lord Hector. We've come to save you!
1790,Lyn: Hector?
1791,"Serra: Oh, come now! Lord Hector! Marquess Ostia's younger brother! He's a good friend of Lord Eliwood's by the way."
1792,"Lyn: Oh...I see. Well, thank you for coming, Serra. I'm glad to see you again."
1793,"Serra: It's no trouble at all! When a dear friend's in trouble, you have to help. It's a rule!"
1794,Lyn: A dear friend?
1795,"Serra: Don't worry. Social positions never bother me. I know we'll get along well, Lyn!"
1796,Lyn: Florina!
1797,Florina: Lady Lyndis!
1798,Lyn: You're unharmed! I'm so relieved. Really!
1799,Florina: Was my service at all helpful?
1800,Lyn: Of course it was! You saved us! Thank you!
1801,Florina: Tee hee! I'll do even better next time!
1802,Lyn: I'm counting on it!
1803,"Erk: Lady Lyndis, please stay back. I'll serve as the advance guard."
1804,"Lyn: Hm? You... Is that you, Erk?"
1805,"Erk: Yes, my lady. A pleasure to see you."
1806,"Lyn: Erk, why are you here in Caelin?"
1807,"Erk: For reasons of my own, I've joined up with Eliwood's company. We're here to rescue Caelin. Please, Lady Lyndis, would you kindly withdraw?"
1808,Lyn: My grandfather is in the castle. I'm not going to retreat from this battle!
1809,"Erk: You might be a noblewoman, but you haven't changed at all. Very well, at least stay near me. I'll be your escort."
1810,Lyn: Thank you Erk.
1811,"Lyn: Dorcas! Dorcas, is that you?"
1812,"Dorcas: Glad you're well, Lyn."
1813,Lyn: What are you doing in Caelin?
1814,"Dorcas: I'm working for a Pheraen nobleman. When talk came of Caelin, he grew worried about you. Looks like we got here in time..."
1815,"Lyn: Yes, thank you. However, my grandfather is still in the castle."
1816,Dorcas: I understand. Let's do what we can do.
1817,Lyn: Dorcas? Is Natalie in Lycia with you?
1818,Dorcas: Uh-huh. We moved there when I saw it firsthand with you. She's waiting for me now in Pherae.
1819,Lyn: Really? That's good. I'd enjoy seeing her again sometime.
1820,"Dorcas: She feels the same way about you. Someday... When you've free time, will you come for a visit?"
1821,"Lyn: Yes, of course! Once the fighting's done, I'll definitely come see you."
1822,"Eliwood: Command Bauker… He was a fierce enemy. Lyndis, once we’ve defeated the remaining foe, the castle’s yours."
1823,"Lyn: Thank you, Eliwood. If not for your help, I don’t know where I’d be right now."
1824,Eliwood: All of this happened because we routed Lord Darin at Laus. It’s only right that we help.
1825,"Lyn: You explained your motives to me, Eliwood. This is about your father. I would do the same thing in your position. What happened in Caelin is not your fault."
1826,"Eliwood: Thank you. However, until your castle is yours again, I take responsibility."
1827,Lyn: I understand. Thank you.
1828,Hector: Eliwood! We’re moving into the castle!
1829,Eliwood: All right.
1830,Lyn: Who’s that?
1831,"Eliwood: Oh, yes. Let me introduce you. Hector!"
1832,Hector: What?
1833,"Eliwood: This is Lyndis. She’s Lord Hausen’s granddaughter. Lyndis, this is Hector. He’s Lord Uther’s brother."
1834,Lyn: His brother? Really?
1835,Hector: Yes.
1836,"Lyn: I was watching the way he fights… He’s not like you, Eliwood. He’s somewhat like my own knights, but different still. He relies so much on power. It’s like he’s never been…"
1837,Hector: I haven’t. I taught myself how to fight.
1838,"Lyn: I’ve no issue with that, but the way you swing that axe around… You’re a threat to your allies! You should be more watchful."
1839,Hector: What did you say?
1840,Eliwood: Lyndis? What’s come over you?
1841,Lyn: Hm? Oh…I… My apologies. I didn’t intend to seem so critical.
1842,Hector: ……
1843,"Eliwood: Granted, Hector’s style may be a tad dangerous, but… There’s no one I depend on more. You may think him careless, but he’s always aware of his surroundings."
1844,"Hector: The more you praise me, the less worthy I sound."
1845,"Eliwood: Lyndis, once you fight alongside Hector, I’m sure you’ll understand."
1846,"Lyn: I’m sure you’re right. I apologize, Hector. I’m honored to have your help."
1847,Hector: No apology necessary. I’m glad I can lend a hand.
1848,"Eliwood: Let’s go inside, shall we?"
1849,"Lyn: Mark! Is it really you, Mark? So good to see you! Have you been well?"
1850,"Kent: Well met, Mark. Good to see you again."
1851,Sain: Well! This really is a pleasant surprise!
1852,"Wil: Hello, Mark! Has it really been a year?"
1853,"Lyn: What’s wrong, Florina? You needn’t hide back there."
1854,Florina: Um… Nice to see you again. I don’t suppose you… Do you…remember me?
1855,"Lyn: Everyone who remained in Caelin speaks of you fondly. We’re always saying “I wonder where Mark is…” Yes…you’re right. This isn’t the best time to catch up. We’re here to rescue my grandfather. Mark, will you help me again?"
1856,Darin: Ri…Ridiculous… Even Bauker?
1857,"Hausen: Lord Darin, it’s time to give up this madness. Further resistance is meaningless. For what you’ve done, you may never be forgiven, but it’s not too late to try. Tell Eliwood everything. He’ll intervene with Marquess Ostia on your behalf…"
1858,Darin: I…I’ve…lost…
1859,Hausen: Hurry! Eliwood will be here in no time. Let me speak for you. Gurr… Guaaaa!!
1860,Ephidel: None of that now. Marquess Laus needs no troublesome advice.
1861,Darin: L-Lord Ephidel?
1862,"Ephidel: There is no turning back for you now. You should know that. First, Marquess Santaruz… and now Marquess Caelin. Both deaths are on your head."
1863,Darin: What? It was by your hand that they both died! I-I never asked for this.
1864,"Ephidel: Yes, I killed them… for you."
1865,Darin: To…trap me?
1866,"Ephidel: Don’t be absurd. I follow my master’s orders. My only wish is to deliver your dreams to you. The crown of a united Lycia…. And once that is done, dominion over the entire continent. Is that not what you desire?"
1867,"Darin: … … …Yes…Yes, of course. That dream IS still worth a few sacrifices, isn’t it?"
1868,"Ephidel: You’re exactly right. Our plans may have gone drastically awry, but as long as we have the master’s power behind us, we cannot be defeated. We’d do well to leave now, before those meddlesome worms arrive. You will leave everyone from Laus behind. We will use them to delay our foe."
1869,Darin: Everyone… My soldiers? But…who will protect me?
1870,"Ephidel: The Black Fang and I will more than suffice for that task. There is nothing else you need, I assure you."
1871,Darin: Yes…I…I see that now. Where do we go from here?
1872,"Ephidel: To the Dragon’s Gate… Our master awaits us there. The master has informed me our hostage may be all we need. If all goes well, we may be able to perform the ceremony with him alone."
1873,Darin: Oh! Is that so? I suppose we’ve nothing to worry about.
1874,"Ephidel: That is correct. Now please, begin your retreat. I have two or three orders to give, then I will be right behind you."
1875,Ephidel: Pathetic imbecile… Leila? Where are you?
1876,Leila: I’m here.
1877,"Ephidel: While Eliwood is occupied, finish off Marquess Caelin and hide the body. The enemy will waste precious time searching for him."
1878,Leila: As you command…
1879,"Ephidel: You know, you’ve only been with the Black Fang a short while. However, you are quite skilled… I look forward to watching you."
1880,"Leila: Yes, sir."
1881,"Hector and his companions defeat Marquess Laus's son, Erik, and seize Castle Laus. After the battle, they rest in the castle and settle their affairs. They diligently prepare for a possible counterattack. They should've spotted anyone attempting to approach the castle. And yet, somehow, they find themselves facing an unforeseen attack...
"
1882,Oswin: Lord Hector! We're under attack!
1883,Hector: Is it Marquess Laus? He's come back to take the castle? Perfect! We'll catch him easily.
1884,"Oswin: No, it's not him... The attackers aren't regular army. Maybe they're mercenaries hired by Laus..."
1885,Hector: Mercenaries?
1886,Oswin: Their movements are very rapid... Coordinated. They've already made their way into the castle.
1887,"Hector: For mercenaries, they're very, very good. Eliwood, do you have any ideas?"
1888,"Eliwood: My father told me something once... There's a mercenary group extremely loyal to house Laus. Their leader is named Eubans, but he's called the Hurricane. He's famed for surprise attacks and lightning-swift strikes."
1889,Hector: Hmmm... This could be interesting. Protect the throne! We will not lose this castle!
1890,Heath: Sealen.
1891,"Sealen: Is that you, Heath?"
1892,"Heath: I've secured a retreat path, as Commander Eubans ordered. Just in case something goes wrong..."
1893,"Sealen: I don't need you to tell me when to retreat. If we lose the element of surprise, we fall back."
1894,"Heath: I've heard there are Ostian knights among the enemy forces. Watch yourself, Sealen."
1895,"Sealen: Are we friends now? Worrying so about a complete stranger... Heath, you weren't meant to be a mercenary."
1896,Hector: Yes! We survived!
1897,Oswin: The rest of the enemy units have begun to retreat. It must be part of their plan. Half of them are already gone.
1898,"Hector: Blast! You have to admire their efficiency, though. Eubans’s mercenaries… I won’t forget this. We’ll likely cross paths again someday. And there’s the assassins I fought in Ostia….."
1899,Oswin: Hector? Is something wrong?
1900,"Hector: No, nothing special. We simply have to tighten our belts and prepare. It appears we have more than one enemy. Oswin!"
1901,Oswin: We’ll see to the castle defenses at once...
1902,Hector: No. I grow weary of defending things. Let’s get out of here and pursue Marquess Laus. It’s time to put him on the defense!
1903,"Eliwood and colleagues defeat Bauker, one of Marquess Laus's lackeys. They then press on toward Castle Caelin. Yet inside the castle many Laus soldiers remain. Eliwood and friends begin their assault on the castle to save Marquess Caelin.
"
1904,"Near Laus, Hector defeats General Bauker. Hector and his allies now march toward Castle Caelin. However, many Laus soldiers await them inside. They begin their assault to liberate the castle.
"
1905,"Lucius: Lyn! Are you well?
"
1906,Hector: Looks like there are still a lot of Laus soldiers in the castle.
1907,"Eliwood: Lyndis, where are the Caelin guards?"
1908,Lyn: I think about half of them were killed in the surprise attack. The survivors must be here somewhere…
1909,"Hector: They’re probably locked away as prisoners. Right. Well, let’s find and rescue them too!"
1910,Eliwood: I wish we had more power to make up for our poor numbers.
1911,"Lyn: Hold on, Grandfather… We’ll be there shortly."
1912,Hector: Time to get inside! Let’s reclaim the castle! The key to victory is seizing the throne! That’s where we’ll find their commander I’m sure.
1913,"Merlinus: Um, hellooooo!"
1914,Eliwood: Hm?
1915,Merlinus: Are you from Castle Caelin?
1916,Lyn: I am. May I ask your business in the castle?
1917,"Merlinus: I am Merlinus. I am a traveling merchant with goods beyond compare. If you would be so kind to hire me, I…"
1918,Lyn: My apologies. Now is not the time.
1919,"Merlinus: Please, my lady… I’ve dreamt of working for a noble house for so long. By all means, please call on my services!"
1920,Hector: Old man! Are you truly a merchant?
1921,Merlinus: Old… Old man?
1922,"Eliwood: You’re being rude, Hector!"
1923,"Hector: Right, right. Old…gentleman. Is it true you aspire to work for a noble house?"
1924,"Merlinus: Yes, my boy. Yes, I do."
1925,"Hector: In that case, we’d like to hire you."
1926,Merlinus: Really?
1927,Eliwood: Hector?
1928,"Hector: This journey could last a while, and we’ve acquired many items. It would be quite convenient if we had someone to manage our things."
1929,Merlinus: Leave it to me! Managing…things is my specialty!
1930,"Eliwood: Our journey is dangerous, and has no end in sight. Is that acceptable?"
1931,Merlinus: Did you say da-dangerous?
1932,Hector: I’m brother to Marquess Ostia. He’s Marquess Pherae’s son. You can come with us if you so desire.
1933,Merlinus: Oh? Ostia and Pherae? Nobility beyond compare! I’m coming! Most definitely!
1934,"Eliwood: Mark. The captured Caelin soldiers are most likely exhausted. I'd like to protect them and keep them from having to fight. I realize that makes it difficult for you to plan a strategy, but... I will do my best to take up their share of the fighting. Now, please tell us what we should do, Mark."
1935,"Hector: Mark. We can't count on the captured Caelin soldiers to be able to fight. We'll have to protect them as much as possible. What!? That chill feeling... Someone's watching... and wants me dead! No sense in worrying, though. I'll deal with it when it happens. Let's go, Mark!"
1936,"Raven: Hey, you. Let me out of here."
1937,Laus Soldier: What?
1938,"Raven: Marquess Ostia’s brother is among your enemy, right? Let me out, and I’ll help you. But I must have the brother. I’ve a score to settle with House Ostia."
1939,Laus Soldier: Do you think me a fool? You work for house Caelin! I cannot trust your word!
1940,"Raven: Then I’ll have to break down this door and go through you. You were using Lucius as a hostage, but now he’s here with me…"
1941,Laus Soldier: Uh…
1942,"Lucius: No, Lord Raven! You mustn’t! You cannot betray your debt to Marquess Caelin."
1943,"Raven: Shut up, Lucius. You think me foolish, but you don’t understand… How about it?"
1944,"Laus Soldier: Very well. You! Get out! Remember, if you betray us, your companion dies."
1945,"Raven: I see. Just remember, if that happens, you die next."
1946,Laus Soldier: Urr…
1947,Lucius: Wait! You can’t go alone! It’s too dangerous!
1948,"Raven: Lucius, stay here and be quiet. I’ll be back for you."
1949,Lucius: Lord Raven!
1950,Caelin Soldier: What in blazes!? It’s getting even noisier than before.
1951,Lucius: Isn’t that the sound of combat?
1952,Caelin Soldier: It must be Lady Lyndis! She’s found reinforcements! It’s time…
1953,Lucius: Hm? What… What are you doing?
1954,"Caelin Soldier: I thought aid might come, so I hid keys and weapons here."
1955,"Lucius: Oh, I see."
1956,Caelin Soldier: What are you going to do?
1957,Lucius: Uh…
1958,"Caelin Soldier: Your master… He’s betrayed us. Lucius, I must ask. What will you do?"
1959,"Lucius: I… I want to stop Lord Raven. However… In his current state, I…doubt he will lend me his ear. And so…I will…wait. I will wait for Lord Raven here. I’m sorry… I cannot fight. …Please understand."
1960,"Caelin Soldier: I do. Here, these are for you."
1961,Lucius: For me? Vulnerary and a book of light magic?
1962,"Caelin Soldier: You don’t have to fight, just protect yourself. I’ve known you only a short time, but you’re a friend. I don’t want to see you die."
1963,Lucius: Thank you… Thank you.
1964,"Caelin Soldier: All right, lads! Open that door!! On our honor as Caelin knights, we will save the marquess!"
1965,Raven: You…
1966,Priscilla: Hm?
1967,Raven: Can it be?
1968,Priscilla: I…
1969,Raven: You don’t… recognize me. That’s not surprising. You were so young when we were separated.
1970,"Priscilla: What? Are you… Raymond? My brother, Raymond?"
1971,"Raven: You’ve grown, Priscilla…"
1972,Priscilla: Brother! My brother!!
1973,Raven: What are you doing here? It’s been ten years since Count Caerleon of Etruria took you in as his foster daughter…
1974,"Priscilla: That’s right. My adopted father has treated me with much kindness. But I am of Caelin’s House Cornwell by birth. I still remember Father and Mother.  I’ve never forgotten them. Or you, Raymond."
1975,Raven: …Priscilla.
1976,Priscilla: ……When I heard that House Cornwell was lost…I… I was so worried about you.
1977,Raven: So that’s why you left Etruria? You’ve come quite a way.
1978,Priscilla: Dear friends of mine in Etruria helped me. They provided a young mage to be my escort. Then we passed through Laus… The marquess learned of my lineage and refused to let me leave. I would be there still if not for Lord Eliwood and his companions.
1979,Raven: His…companions?
1980,"Priscilla: Lord Hector, Lady Lyndis… They’re all such kind people. I’m so glad I came to Lycia. And now I’ve found you…"
1981,Raven: You’ve become friends with…him?
1982,Priscilla: Raymond?
1983,Raven: ……I see. Then I will join you.
1984,Priscilla: Dear Brother! Will you truly come with us?
1985,Raven: I could not refuse my little sister. And besides…
1986,Priscilla: What is it?
1987,"Raven: It’s nothing. You’re better off not knowing. Tell me, your lineage… Do Eliwood and his friends know of your heredity?"
1988,"Priscilla: No, we’ve never spoken of it."
1989,Raven: I see… That is best.
1990,Priscilla: Brother?
1991,"Raven: Priscilla, we must keep our relationship secret. OK?"
1992,Priscilla: All right… If you say we must…
1993,"Raven: Another thing, my name is Raven now. Raymond is…a name I’ve discarded."
1994,"Priscilla: Brother… You have your reasons, don’t you? I understand. As long as we can travel together, I’m happy."
1995,Raven: ……
1996,"Priscilla: If we continue on, we’ll be able to see Father and Mother, too!"
1997,Raven: …Priscilla… That’s……
1998,Lyn: Are you all well?
1999,Soldier: Lady Lyndis! You’re unharmed!
2000,"Lyn: Please, I need all of you to help!"
2001,"Soldier: Yes, my liege! We are yours to command!"
2002,Wil: Is everyone OK?
2003,Soldier: Wil! Glad to see you’re well!
2004,"Wil: Yes, against all odds. Laus has some tough soldiers, but they can’t defeat us, can they?"
2005,Soldier: NEVER!!! Let’s show them the might of the Caelin knights!
2006,Kent: Is everyone well?
2007,Soldier: Commander Kent! You’re safe!
2008,Kent: Can you fight?
2009,"Soldier: Of course, sir!"
2010,Kent: Then let’s drive these knaves out of Castle Caelin!
2011,"Soldier: Yes, sir!"
2012,"Sain: Rejoice, one and all! Your beloved subcommander is here to rescue you!"
2013,Soldier: Subcommander! You’re unharmed!
2014,Sain: Are you ready to fight?
2015,"Soldier: Absolutely, sir!"
2016,Sain: All right! Direct your energy on your foes and drive them out!
2017,"Soldier: Yes, sir!"
2018,Florina: Everyone… Are you well?
2019,Soldier: Oh! Florina! You’re unharmed!
2020,"Florina: Yes, uhm… I’m with Lady Lyndis."
2021,Soldier: Nice work! Leave the rest to us!
2022,"Florina: Now, I’ll…uh…take you to Lord Eliwood. ……Huh? Wa-Wait for me!"
2023,Lyn: Lucius?! Why are you here?
2024,"Lucius: Actually, I’ve been here for a few days as a mercenary."
2025,Lyn: I didn’t know. Why didn’t you send word?
2026,"Lucius: Well…I’m… I’m traveling with someone, and… More importantly, I apologize for not being able to protect Castle Caelin. My lack of… strength… is truly shameful."
2027,Lyn: It’s no one’s fault. The attack came so quickly. I was forced to flee myself. Now I simply want to rescue my grandfather as soon as possible. That is all I wish…
2028,Lucius: May…I offer… my assistance?
2029,Lyn: It’s not necessary.
2030,Lucius: Pardon?
2031,"Lyn: Your hands are shaking terribly. I thank you for your offer, but you cannot fight in this condition."
2032,Lucius: I… I’m sorry.
2033,Lyn: It’s all right. I do ask that you help me when you’re able.
2034,Lucius: Yes… Of course.
2035,Lucius: Lyn! Are you well?
2036,Lyn: Lucius?! Why are you here?
2037,"Lucius: Actually, I’ve been here for a few days as a mercenary."
2038,Lyn: I didn’t know. Why didn’t you send word?
2039,"Lucius: Well…I’m… I’m traveling with someone, and… More importantly, I apologize for not being able to protect Castle Caelin. My lack of …strength… is truly shameful."
2040,Lyn: It’s no one’s fault. The attack came so quickly. I was forced to flee myself. Now I simply want to rescue my grandfather as soon as possible. That is all I wish…
2041,Lucius: I truly hope I can be of service.
2042,"Lyn: You can, Lucius. I’m counting on you."
2043,Raven: Lucius.
2044,Lucius: Lord Raven! I’m so pleased to see you well!
2045,"Raven: Things have changed. For the time being, we side with Caelin."
2046,Lucius: That is good… So you’ve had a change of heart?
2047,"Raven: No, I will still have my revenge against House Ostia. The closer you are to your enemy, the easier it is to strike, right?"
2048,Lucius: Lo-Lord Raven…
2049,"Raven: Let’s go, Lucius."
2050,Lucius: Yes…
2051,"Bernard: I am Bernard, Knight Commander of Laus! I would test the might of those who bested Bauker!"
2052,Bernard: This is a just reward… for Laus’s brutality…
2053,Lyn: Grandfather! Grandfather! Where…
2054,Eliwood: Lord Hausen? Where are you?
2055,"Hector: Eliwood. Here, on the throne… It’s blood."
2056,Lyn: Blood? No! It can’t be!!
2057,"Eliwood: Lyndis! Calm down. He might only be injured. Come, let us find him."
2058,"Lyn: Yes, you’re right. I must be calm. There! Over there! There’s someone…"
2059,Eliwood: Who’s there? Show yourself!
2060,Leila: ……
2061,Hector: You… Leila!
2062,"Leila: Yes, it’s me, Lord Hector. It’s been a long time."
2063,Eliwood: You know her?
2064,"Hector: Yes, her name’s Leila. She…works for Ostia… All right, she’s a spy."
2065,"Leila: Lord Eliwood of Pherae and Lady Lyndis of Caelin, correct? I am Leila. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Lady Lyndis, Marquess Caelin is back there receiving treatment."
2066,Lyn: My grandfather is safe?!
2067,Leila: …His life is yet his own.
2068,Lyn: Ah! Father Sky and Mother Earth! I thank you for your mercy!!
2069,"Hector: Leila, what are you doing here?"
2070,Leila: I… I’m following Lord Uther’s orders. I’m investigating Marquess Pherae’s disappearance.
2071,Eliwood: My father? What have you learned?
2072,Leila: Come with me. We should talk in private.
2073,Eliwood: ……
2074,"Hector: Huh? Come on, Eliwood."
2075,Eliwood: Ah…
2076,Hector: Worrying about things won’t change them.
2077,Eliwood: I know. I’m fine. Let’s go!
2078,Leila: Let me start with my conclusion.
2079,Eliwood: ……
2080,Leila: Marquess Pherae… is alive.
2081,Hector: Whooooo! Eliwood!
2082,Lyn: That’s wonderful!
2083,Eliwood: Are you sure?
2084,Leila: I’ve been posing as a member of the Black Fang for several months. That’s where I got this information. I believe it is true.
2085,Eliwood: Black Fang… They’re the assassins guild that Erik spoke of.
2086,"Leila: Yes, we’ve known of their existence for quite some time."
2087,Hector: Explain.
2088,"Leila: The Black Fang is a guild of assassins founded about ten years ago by Brendan Reed. They’re based in Bern. Their arms reached quickly in several other countries. Originally, they targeted only nobles who abused their positions. The masses saw them as chivalrous, defenders of the common man. Their activities found wide support."
2089,Hector: Chivalrous…
2090,"Leila: Then about a year ago, Brendan got married again. Black Fang’s operations have slowly changed since then. Now, they’ll take on any target, no matter how difficult, as long as they’re paid. And they’re no longer killing only criminals; anyone is a fair target."
2091,Lyn: Is this Black Fang responsible for what’s happened to my grandfather?
2092,"Leila: Yes. We’ve learned of a mystery man named Nergal, behind Reed’s wife. It seems the Black Fang is performing secret tasks across Lycia for Nergal. Nergal’s trusted retainer Ephidel is with Marquess Laus. He manipulated Laus into hatching the rebellion plot against Ostia. The first to answer Laus’s call for rebellion was… Marquess Santaruz."
2093,Eliwood: Lord Helman… Why would you…
2094,Hector: ……
2095,"Leila: Next was Lord Elbert, Marquess Pherae."
2096,Eliwood: You’re telling me that my father endorsed this plan?
2097,Leila: I cannot say. I do know that he is with Marquess Laus currently. In a place called… the Dragon’s Gate.
2098,Eliwood: Dragon’s Gate? Where is that?
2099,"Leila: On an isle called Valor, off the southern coast of Lycia. I apologize, but that is all the information I have."
2100,"Hector: Of all places to be, Valor… Blast!"
2101,Lyn: What kind of place is it?
2102,"Eliwood: It’s said that those who step onto the island never return. The common folk call it the Dread Isle. If that’s where my father is, however,  I will go and find him.  And this “Dragon’s Gate,” too!"
2103,"Hector: I’m going with you. I’ll tell you right now, you can’t stop me."
2104,Lyn: I’m also going.
2105,"Eliwood: Lyndis, I appreciate your kindness, but… Shouldn’t you stay with Marquess Caelin?"
2106,"Lyn: Laus must be stopped. Otherwise, they might target my grandfather again. I also wish to help Eliwood’s father. Losing a parent… It’s an unbearable pain. It’s something I’d rather you didn’t have to feel yet."
2107,Eliwood: Lyndis… Hector… Thank you. You give me strength.
2108,Hector: Don’t mention it.
2109,"Lyn: We’re friends. It’s what friends do, Eliwood."
2110,"Leila: I’m also going to continue searching. Lady Lyndis, I think it would be prudent to let the world think Marquess Caelin is dead."
2111,Lyn: I understand. I’ll do that. Thank you.
2112,Leila: No thanks necessary. If you’ll excuse me.
2113,Hector: Leila!
2114,Leila: Yes?
2115,Hector: Nergal and this…Ephidel? What are they like?
2116,"Leila: I’ve yet to lay eyes on Nergal. I’ve spoken to Ephidel on several occasions, however. He’s…eerie. He always wears a cloak that covers his face. And yet…"
2117,Hector: What is it?
2118,Leila: His eyes glow golden… You can’t miss them. They seem…inhuman.
2119,Eliwood: ……
2120,"Matthew: Is that you, Leila?"
2121,Leila: Matthew. It’s been a long time.
2122,Matthew: What have you been doing? More dangerous work?
2123,"Leila: We’re spies, Matthew. Everything we do is dangerous."
2124,Matthew: That’s true. So how long do you think this mission’s going to last?
2125,"Leila: My objective is the same as yours: to rescue Marquess Pherae. If things go well, I’ll be in Ostia at the same time as you are."
2126,Matthew: Is that so? You need to visit my hometown.
2127,Leila: Is this where you were born? Why?
2128,Matthew: …To meet my parents.
2129,Leila: Hm? Matthew…
2130,"Matthew: Ha ha. Well, that’s that! See you."
2131,Leila: As slippery as ever… Didn’t even wait for my reply.
2132,Soldier: Lady Lyndis!
2133,Lyn: Everyone… I’m happy to see you all well. I’m going after Marquess Laus. Protect my grandfather.
2134,"Soldier: One moment, Lady Lyndis. Please take this jewel before you leave."
2135,Lyn: Jewel?
2136,Soldier: We were able to move it before Laus’s men ransacked our vaults.
2137,"Other Soldier: We will take care of Lord Hausen. Please, Lady Lyndis, return to us safely."
2138,Lyn: I will. Thank you.
2139,Soldier: Lady Lyndis!
2140,Lyn: I’m happy to see that at least you survived. I’m going after Marquess Laus. Protect my grandfather.
2141,"Soldier: One moment, Lady Lyndis. Please take this before you leave."
2142,Lyn: What…
2143,"Soldier: I was able to move it before Laus’s men ransacked our vaults. I will take care of Lord Hausen. Please, Lady Lyndis, come home safely."
2144,Lyn: I will. Thank you.
2145,"After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila, Eliwood realizes he must travel to Valor, the Dread Isle. The small island, located south of Lyica, is said to be home to the Dragon's Gate. Heading for the southern coast of Caelin, they seek passage in the port of Badon.
"
2146,Hector: Listen! We need a boat to Valor!
2147,Villager: You want a boat to the Dread Isle? You're mad! No way! Never! There's no one in this village who'll sail there!
2148,"Lyn: Please, we're in a hurry. Can you give us passage?"
2149,"Eliwood: If you won't help us, can you take us to someone who will? Please."
2150,"Villager: You must be on urgent business, that's certain. ......There may be one way..."
2151,"Eliwood: What is it? Tell us, please!"
2152,Villager: Pirates.
2153,Lyn: Eh? Pirates?
2154,"Villager: Uh-huh. They're fearless, or as close as makes no difference, and they'll go anywhere for a fee. Who knows? They might decide to accept your mad offer."
2155,Hector: Pirates... Looks like we've no choice.
2156,"Lyn: Are you serious, Hector? Working with pirates? That's unbelievable! You're considering it, aren't you, Eliwood?"
2157,"Eliwood: If there's no other way, what else can we do?"
2158,"Lyn: You, too, Eliwood? I've misjudged you... It's foolishness to trust the goodwill of pirates! I'm finding another way! (Lyn leaves)"
2159,Hector: Why is she so angry?
2160,"Eliwood: I heard that Lyndis's parents were slain by bandits. Bandits at land, pirates at sea... They're all the same to Lyndis. Lawbreakers and murderers."
2161,Hector: I see... My parents died of illness... But I can appreciate her feelings. Shall we abandon the pirate plan?
2162,Eliwood: But...
2163,"Villager: Too bad about the girl, but there's no other way."
2164,Eliwood: Let's meet the pirates. We can't decide until then.
2165,Hector: That's true.
2166,Villager: That inn over there is a known favorite of the local freebooters. They're reckless and unpredictable. Best be prepared.
2167,"Fargus: What do you want, whelps? You're here to see me, aren't you?"
2168,"Eliwood: You're commander of the pirate armada, aren't you?"
2169,"Fargus: Gwah hah hah! ""Commander of the pirate armada!"" I like the sound of that! Are you lads that naive? Or are you just dumb? Which is it?"
2170,Hector: You insolent...
2171,"Eliwood: Peace, Hector!"
2172,"Eliwood: If I've insulted you, I apologize. How should I address you?"
2173,"Fargus: Hmph... You don't frighten easily, do you? Well, at least it seems you're not stupid. ""Captain"" will do, whelp. I'm Fargus, captain of the Davros."
2174,Eliwood: Fargus... Master Fargus? Or should I call you Captain?
2175,"Fargus: You're not one of my mates. Call me Fargus. Now, what do you want?"
2176,Eliwood: We want to book passage to Valor.
2177,Fargus: How much will you pay?
2178,Eliwood: We don't know the current rates. Tell us how much you want.
2179,"Fargus: 100,000 gold."
2180,"Hector: Wait, 100,000 gold?"
2181,Fargus: Well? Will you pay?
2182,"Eliwood: We've no choice, but we need a little time. We'll get the gold and return as quickly as possible. Come, Hector."
2183,Hector: Wa-Wait a moment! Eliwood!
2184,"Hector: Eliwood! Hold on! Where do you think you're going to get 100,000 gold?"
2185,Eliwood: I'm sure there's an arena here. We can raise gold somehow...
2186,Hector: What? You're not serious!?
2187,"Eliwood: We've no other way, do we?"
2188,"Hector: Well, no. (Steps back) Sometimes you surprise me, Eliwood."
2189,"Eliwood: Did you say something, Hector?"
2190,"Hector: No, nothing. Let's go earn some gold!"
2191,"Dart: (Appears) Ahoy! Hold your ground, boys!"
2192,Hector: What now? We don't have the money yet.
2193,Dart: Fool! Of course you don't! I know that. The captain's got a message for you.
2194,Eliwood: A message?
2195,"Dart: All of my mates in this village are going to attack you. If you can beat us all and get to the ship unharmed, he'll give you passage."
2196,Eliwood: For free? No gold?
2197,Dart: The captain's a tad off-kilter. He'd rather have a bit o' fun with you than take your gold. Smooth sailing to you.
2198,Dart: Hey! Landlubbers! Over here! I'm over here!
2199,"Hector: Oh, for... This is a joke, isn't it?"
2200,Eliwood: Looks serious enough. Here we go!
2201,"Dart: Listen! The captain's waiting at the docks. Talk to him and you're the winner! Trust me, though.... Don't make the mistake of attacking him! You anger the captain, and there's no turning back! Don't forget!!"
2202,Lyn: (Comes out of a nearby house) I couldn't find a ship after all. But we have to get to that island... Looks like I'll have to endure pirates. Hm? What was that? Commotion in the village?
2203,Hector: Oh! Lyn! Nice timing. We need your help!
2204,Lyn: You're battling the pirates?
2205,"Eliwood: Fighting and... Look, we have to reach the docks and speak to the captain! This is a test to see whether or not he'll give us passage."
2206,"Lyn: I don't understand, but.... I'm here, so let me help!"
2207,"Lucius: Good to see you again, Mark. Our reunion is surely the work of blessed Elimine. I’m most pleased to travel with you once more. Your commands, please."
2208,"Raven: So you’re the tactician, huh? I’m Raven. I’m just a mercenary. I work for these guys now, so it looks like I’ll take your orders. What are you waiting for? What do you need me to do?"
2209,"Fargus: What mooncalves! I would've just let them sit there if they hadn't come any closer! Rush 'em, boys!"
2210,"Fargus: Aha! You made it, whelps!"
2211,Hector: That was... hard...
2212,"Eliwood: Haa...haa...You'll give us passage now, won't you?"
2213,Fargus: I'm a man of the sea. I always keep my word. (Sees Lyn) Are my old eyes lyin' to me? Is this beauty really with you? Gwaa ha ha ha!! My lucky day! (Leaves)
2214,Lyn: .....
2215,"Hector: Listen, I know how you feel, but you have to accept it. We've no other choice!"
2216,"Lyn: I know that! I haven't said a word, have I?"
2217,"Eliwood: We can go to the Dread Isle now. Please, Father... be well."
2218,"After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila, Eliwood realizes he must travel to Valor, the Dread Isle. They head straight to the port city of Badon seeking passage. After a long journey, they spot a fog-enshrouded isle on the horizon. Eliwood's father is on the isle, as is the Dragon's Gate. As they draw closer to the isle, Eliwood no longer fears that his father might be one of the conspirators. As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood only prays that he is safe.
"
2219,"Fargus's ship sails along smoothly. At last, they spot a fog-enshrouded isle on the horizon. Eliwood's father is on the isle, as is the Dragon's Gate. As they draw closer to the isle, Eliwood no longer fears that his father might be one of the conspirators. As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood only prays that he is safe.
"
2220,"Fargus's ship sails along smoothly. At last, they spot a fog-enshrouded isle on the horizon. According to Leila's information, the enemy is gathering there. Darin, the marquess of Laus, the Black Fang assassins, the mysterious Nergal, and his henchman, Ephidel. As the island draws closer, Hector hears death whispering on the wind.
"
2221,"Fargus: Ahoy, laddie! You don't get seasick, do you?"
2222,"Eliwood: I'm fine, sir. This is a beautiful ship."
2223,"Fargus: Gwaa ha ha! For a sea rover, eh?"
2224,Eliwood: May I ask you a question?
2225,Fargus: What is it?
2226,"Eliwood: Why did you agree to give us passage? When we said that we wished to travel to Valor, the people in the harbor treated us as though we were mad."
2227,"Fargus: I'm sure they did. It is the Dread Isle, after all. If not for good reason, we wouldn't want to go either."
2228,Eliwood: And yet... you've given us free passage. Why is that?
2229,"Fargus: Listen to me, laddie. Man are strange beasts. We can't resist a challenge. Something appears on the horizon, and we immediately set sail. Some dreams we conquer, others we abandon... I've grown old. I haven't had a good challenge in many a year. Then you mooncalves appear seeking passage to the Dread Isle. I was impressed with your courage. I think you may be the ones to survive the Dread Isle."
2230,Eliwood: We won't disappoint you. We will return.
2231,"Fargus: All right. Then we'll weigh anchor and wait for you. Light a signal fire when you want to return, and we'll pick you up."
2232,Eliwood: Thank you.
2233,Dart: Captain! There's a dory adrift to port! It looks like there's someone aboard. What're your orders?
2234,"Fargus: Bring 'em aboard..... Looks like we've got a visitor. Odd though, finding a boat adrift near here..."
2235,Eliwood: Odd? Why is that?
2236,Fargus: The sea currents in this area... Anything drifting around here must've come from the Dread Isle.
2237,Eliwood: Oh...
2238,Fargus: Shall we greet our guest?
2239,Lyn: .......
2240,Hector: Eliwood! ...Huh?
2241,"Lyn: If you're looking for Eliwood, he's talking with the captain."
2242,Hector: Oh. I won't bother him then.
2243,Lyn: ....... ...Do you need something?
2244,Hector: I'd like you to stop pouting. This pirate ship is the only way for us to get to the Dread Isle. I thought you understood that. Was I mistaken?
2245,Lyn: How I feel or what I think is no concern of yours!
2246,Hector: Eliwood told me...about your parents and those bandits. But these pirates? They don't seem like bad fellows.
2247,"Lyn: It wasn't just my parents! My entire tribe! Everyone was killed! They poisoned our drinking water... My people were in such pain, they could hardly stand... That's when the bandits attacked! They waited until we were defenseless!"
2248,Hector: .......
2249,"Lyn: My father put me on his horse, and I escaped... Just me. My poor father... The pain must have been terrible. He lifted me up...his arms shaking... ...with his last breath... Now do you understand? I was found unconscious by another tribe...and I awoke ten days later. When I awoke... What I felt... The bodies of my people had already been buried. I never even had the chance to say farewell. My last memory of my father... He was...broken...dying. I can still see the axes rising and falling. It... It's not........"
2250,Lyn: Hey!! What are you doing?
2251,"Hector: You're a strong woman, Lyndis. I thought you would not want anyone to see you cry."
2252,"Lyn: You're such a fool! If you think that's what I want, then why not just leave!"
2253,"Hector: I... I lost my parents, too."
2254,Lyn: You...
2255,"Hector: It was illness that took them. Nothing like what happened to you. Still, I wanted nothing more than to cry like a little baby. And yet, I couldn't cry... Not in front of others. And when I was alone, I found I still couldn't. So...I simply thought...I don't know..."
2256,Lyn: You really are a fool. That's no way to... You can't just... ... .... ...
2257,Hector: .......
2258,Pirate: Ahoy! There's a small dory adrift to port!! Someone's on board! Tell the captain!
2259,Lyn: A boat? What's going on?
2260,Hector: Let's go see!
2261,Hector: Eliwood! You done talking to old man Fargus?
2262,Eliwood: You saw us?
2263,"Hector: No, I heard you'd gone off with him. You learn anything?"
2264,"Eliwood: ...We can trust him. We got lucky, finding him."
2265,Hector: Hmmm. If you say so.
2266,"Lyn: Hey, you two! Come here! They've pulled the dory aboard! I wonder who's on board. It's... It's a girl!?"
2267,???: ...Uh...uhnn...
2268,Dart: Oy! You there!
2269,Lyn: Me?
2270,"Dart: Give me a hand, will you? I don't know where to... grab her."
2271,Lyn: ...OK.
2272,Hector: Such the gentleman.
2273,Dart: Stow it!
2274,Lyn: Hm? Ninian!? Ninian! Wake up!!
2275,Eliwood: Unbelievable... What are the chances?
2276,Hector: Do you know her?
2277,Eliwood: She's how Lyndis and I met a year back. I rescued Ninian from a band of villains.
2278,"Lyn: Please, Ninian! Open your eyes!!"
2279,Ninian: .......Ah....
2280,"Lyn: Ninian, can you hear me?"
2281,Ninian: ............Unnn...I.......
2282,Lyn: Are you well? Why were you on that boat? Where is Nils? Why wasn't he with you?
2283,Ninian: .........Ah...ah....
2284,Lyn: Ninian?
2285,"Eliwood: Lyndis, something's wrong with her."
2286,Ninian: Who...Who..
2287,Dart: Captain! Pirate ships approaching from the northwest!
2288,Fargus: Do they dare attack Captain Fargus and the Davros? They must be mad!
2289,Dart: What flag are they flying? I've never seen that pattern before.
2290,"Fargus: These seas belong to us! Whoever they are, they're in our waters! This is a day for strange occurrences, it seems. You whelps watch your own hides. We've no time to waste on you!"
2291,???: Uwaaaaaaa!! Water!!! The hull's been breached! We're taking on water!!!
2292,Fargus: Breached? Those scum are more dangerous than I'd thought!
2293,"Dart: It's bad, Captain! We need all hands belowdecks, or we'll sink!!!"
2294,Fargus: Take care of it! I'm going to carve these scallywags some new gizzards!
2295,"???: We need your help! The water's up to the galley! You must come below, Captain!"
2296,Fargus: Grrr...
2297,Eliwood: Fargus! Leave the enemy to us!
2298,"Hector: Fighting is something we're good at! But a sinking ship? That's your affair! You have to do something, or we'll all drown!"
2299,Lyn: We'll deal with things up here. Please! Hurry!
2300,Fargus: Fine!! The deck is yours! I'll be back as soon as we've plugged the breach in the hull!
2301,Eliwood: Go! (Fargus and pirates leave) Lyn! Take her to that room!
2302,Lyn: I will. (She and Ninian leave)
2303,Hector: Here they come!
2304,Zoldam: All we want is the girl. Kill the rest.
2305,"Jake: Ahoooy! Can you hold the deck until reinforcements arrive? Who? Me? I’m Jake. Hm? Aye, I’m new to the Davros’s crew. Huh? You heard about me from Anna? Oh… So she’s worried about me? That warms my heart, my friend! Let me give you some information. We’ve got merchants aboard. Buy what you need from them. This is the armory. This is the shop. You won’t be able to stock up once we reach the Dread Isle. Buy as much as you can carry while you’ve got the chance!"
2306,"Dart: Ahoy! We’ll leave the fighting to you. Hold on until we can help! Oh, and we’ve merchants aboard. This is the armory. This is the shop. You won’t be able to stock up once we reach the Dread Isle. I suggest you buy as much as possible while you’ve the chance!"
2307,"Guy: Ohhh... I'm going to be sick. Doesn't this bother you, Mark? This ship moves too much... I... I can still fight, though. My sword arm's fine!"
2308,"Priscilla: Mark? What is it? No, I'm fine. I'm not seasick at all. Thank you for your concern."
2309,Zoldam: Move ’round to the enemy ship’s stern. That’s where they should be waiting… That’s where they’ll die.
2310,"Fargus: Ahoy! I’m back! Now, who wants to die first? What’s this? You’ve routed ’em already? Nicely done, whelps!"
2311,Hector: Those sea dogs were no match for us!!
2312,Eliwood: ……
2313,Lyn: Ah! Ninian! You can’t come out yet! There’s blood everywhere!
2314,Ninian: …Blood?
2315,Eliwood: Look out!
2316,Ninian: …Ah! I’m sorry.
2317,Eliwood: Are you OK? Ninian?
2318,Ninian: Ninian? Is that…me? Is that…my name?
2319,Lyn: Ninian! What’s happened to you…
2320,Ninian: …I… My head…is so foggy. Am I…at sea?
2321,Lyn: Yes. We found you adrift in a small boat.
2322,"Fargus: Those scum were after the girl, it seems. Will you take her with you? The men are afraid she, well, she might be cursed, you know?"
2323,Hector: Cursed…?
2324,Lyn: Are you suggesting we leave Ninian behind?
2325,"Hector: We can’t take her with us, can we? We’re heading for the Dread Isle. It’s dread for a reason, you know!"
2326,Lyn: Regardless…she goes with us!
2327,Eliwood: Lyndis?
2328,"Lyn: When I saw her, I remembered something. The last time I saw Ninian… She and her brother were being hunted by some dark-robed men."
2329,Hector: Dark-robed? Are you sure?
2330,"Lyn: Yes, I think it must be the Black Fang. It didn’t occur to me before, but now I’m certain."
2331,Eliwood: How can you be sure?
2332,Lyn: I can’t explain… There’s something in the air that hints at their involvement.
2333,"Eliwood: If it’s true, then she’s likely to be attacked again."
2334,Lyn: Almost certainly. We can’t leave her behind. I will watch over her. Please…
2335,Eliwood: I understand. We should be by her side to protect her.
2336,Lyn: Thank you.
2337,Eliwood: We’re all going to that island. Will you come with us?
2338,Ninian: Yes… Please…take me with you.
2339,Hector: “Something in the air”… Are you some sort of hound?
2340,Lyn: Ah! Are you mocking me?
2341,"Hector: No, the opposite. I’m in utter admiration. …Say, Eliwood. When I left Ostia, I was attacked by a dark-robed group."
2342,Eliwood: What? Why didn’t you tell me this before?
2343,Hector: Many people hold a grudge against Ostia. I didn’t think it had anything to do with this. Until now…
2344,"Eliwood: Hector, do you think…"
2345,"Hector: They were all wearing very distinct black robes. I don’t know about “something in the air,” but… I’m convinced they were related."
2346,Eliwood: What in the world is happening in Lycia? …Father……
2347,Fargus: We’ve arrived.
2348,Eliwood: Thank you very much.
2349,Fargus: We’ll wait two weeks. Finish up by then.
2350,Hector: That’s more than enough time!
2351,"Fargus: And I’ve got a half-wit sailor who wants to go sightseeing. C’mere, Dart!"
2352,"Dart: I’m here, Captain! Ready to serve!"
2353,Eliwood: We’re pleased to have you.
2354,Fargus: His only redeeming feature is his sturdiness. Maybe he’ll come in handy.
2355,"Dart: Come on, Captain! I’m better’n that!"
2356,Eliwood: You’ve done so much… I can’t thank you enough…
2357,Fargus: Come back alive! That’s all the thanks I need.
2358,Eliwood: All right. Farewell!
2359,Hector: We’ll be back before you know it!
2360,"Lyn: …There are good people, even among pirates."
2361,Hector: I don’t think the old man and his group are your average pirates.
2362,Eliwood: Somewhere within that forest is the Dragon’s Gate.
2363,"Hector: Eliwood! No matter what it takes, we’re coming back with your father!"
2364,Lyn: …We’ll surely find him. We’ll all do our best to make it so.
2365,Eliwood: You’re right. Let’s make preparations to enter the forest.
2366,Hector: Oh!
2367,Ninian: Dragon’s Gate…
2368,Lyn: Ninian? What is it?
2369,Ninian: It’s…nothing……
2370,"Eliwood arrives on the shores of Valor with a new companion in his numbers, an enigmatic young girl named Ninian. The majority of the island is covered in dense forest. Legend has it that no one has ever returned from those dark woods. A dense fog crawls over the party, engulfing them one by one... Cautiously, they move deeper into the trees.

2371,"Nergal: Shame on you, Marquess Pherae. You freed the boy AND the girl?"
2372,Elbert: I will not let you move unopposed!
2373,"Darin: (Appears behind Nergal) Wh-What shall we do, Lord Nergal? With both siblings gone, we can no longer hold the ceremony."
2374,"Elbert: How many times must I tell you, Lord Darin? You are being used by this man!! By helping him bring dragons back into this world, you are helping him destroy mankind! Do you understand?!?"
2375,"Darin: Pah...ha ha ha... Destroy mankind? Dragons may have been a threat to mankind in ages past, but with Lord Nergal's power, we've got nothing to fear! Lord Nergal can control dragons!!! Ha ha...ha ha ha..."
2376,Elbert: Lord Darin.... You're already lost. (Darin leaves)
2377,"Nergal: I'd planned to start a war in Lycia. The war I was plotting in Lycia would've generated a glorious amount of FORCE in one blow. You were not equal to the task, it seems. Not to worry, I've other means at hand."
2378,Elbert: Black-hearted fiend! Guuuh!!
2379,Nergal: Hold your tongue. There is still a task you must perform for me. Ephidel! Limstella! (Ephidel and Limstella appear)
2380,"Nergal: My beloved morphs, my beauteous works of art. I've new jobs for you, my pets. First, Limstella. You will go to Bern and contact Sonia. I want you to arrange a meeting with the king."
2381,Limstella: Understood. (Limstella leaves)
2382,"Nergal: Ephidel, take this... man, Marquess Laus, and go. I want you to exterminate the mice who've landed on the island."
2383,"Ephidel: Yes, master. (Ephidel leaves)"
2384,"Nergal: That leaves you, Marquess Pherae. It seems your legacy is one of endurance."
2385,Elbert: !?
2386,Nergal: ...The mouse who interfered with my conquest of Lycia is named Eliwood. Should he be congratulated on making it this far?
2387,"Elbert: Eliwood? My son is here? Stop! Do with me what you will, but let my son be!"
2388,"Nergal: Hm? Heh... Hehahahaha!!! Remember the siblings you freed? The girl's here, too. As a matter of fact, she's with your son, Eliwood. Quite a delicious twist of fate, wouldn't you say?"
2389,Elbert: ....This can't be...
2390,"Nergal: Eliwood will die in these woods. The girl will be returned to me, and the ceremony will take place. Hm... Despite those long hours of torture, you remain undaunted. Such courage will make you the perfect sacrifice, Marquess Pherae. (Nergal leaves)"
2391,Elbert: Eliwood... Turn back... Take the girl and flee...... Please.........
2392,"Leila: I can't believe it's come to this. I must inform Lord Hector of these events... If I hurry, I may be in time. What!?"
2393,Ephidel: (Appears) Leila... Where are you going?
2394,Leila: Lord Ephidel... The sentries... I'm going to check on...
2395,"Ephidel: (Moves closer) You overheard, did you not? ...And I had such hopes for you. Jaffar! (Jaffar appears behind Leila)"
2396,Leila: Ah!!
2397,Jaffar: The punishment for traitors is death. (Combat animation of Jaffar killing Leila)
2398,Lelia: !!!!! Aa.......Ma....Matthew........
2399,"Ephidel: ....Impressive, Jaffar. Your power is beyond compare."
2400,Jaffar: ......
2401,Ephidel: Take this woman's corpse and leave it in the forest. Let it serve as a warning to those fools.
2402,Lyn: Let's get through these woods. It's starting to get foggy... Try not to get separated.
2403,"Hector: (Appears behind her) ""Enter and be lost."" It feels like we're not coming back."
2404,Lyn: Hector!! Are you trying to curse us?
2405,"Eliwood: Are you well, Ninian?"
2406,Ninian: ....Y-Yes... I'm.... I'll be fine.
2407,Eliwood: !? Someone's there!
2408,Hector: Who? A sentry?
2409,"Hector: Leila! Is that you? Impressive work, finding your way here!"
2410,Eliwood: ...Something's wrong. Leila? (Leila's sprite disappears) Lei--!!
2411,Lyn: She's...dead...
2412,Ninian: No!
2413,Hector: ...This can't be. She was one of our best spies. Leila....
2414,Matthew: ......
2415,"Hector: ...I'm sorry, Matthew."
2416,"Matthew: ...Why do you apologize, my lord? Leila blundered. ....That's all."
2417,Eliwood: Matthew... Leila was... She was...
2418,"Matthew: After this mission, I was going to ask her to put this life behind her... Waited too long, didn't I? Ha..... .....My lord, might I...rejoin you later? She has to be buried..."
2419,Hector: ...Of course.
2420,Lyn: Ah... I'll go with you...
2421,Eliwood: ...Let them be alone. There's nothing else we can do....
2422,Hector: Blast! They put her out here for us to find like this!
2423,Lyn: Unforgivable! This is... a foul deed. Beyond foul.
2424,Eliwood: .....Let's go! The foe is somewhere in this forest. We must stop this before any more die!
2425,Ninian: Ah! ....Beware! Something comes!
2426,Lyn: What? (Uhai appears behind Lyn) Kyaa!
2427,Eliwood: Lyndis!!
2428,"Uhai: ...If you value her life, send the girl to me."
2429,Ninian: ...Ah.
2430,"Lyn: You, you're Sacaen!"
2431,"Uhai: That's correct... I am Uhai of the Black Fang. I've been sent to capture the girl... And to kill the lot of you. If, however... you hand over the girl and depart the island at once, I'll grant you your lives."
2432,Lyn: And if we refuse?
2433,"Uhai: You know nothing, little lord. Nothing of Nergal's might. Nothing of his terrible power. You are ignorant, and so you hope to oppose him. You are insects railing against the heavens. Your actions will change nothing. Speak no more foolishness and begone!"
2434,"Eliwood: ...Maybe we don't know what it is we're fighting... But if we flee, our loss is assured. So we will continue to struggle, and we may yet prevail!"
2435,Uhai: ...Folly. (Moves back)
2436,Lyn: What?!
2437,"Lyn: Why are you letting me go? Holding a woman hostage during battle is shameful. You, too, are of Sacae, and I've a mind to show you mercy. I will let you die with a sword in your hands. But rest assured... I will kill you all here. But be of good cheer! In dying, you shall all be spared the calamity that is to come!"
2438,Ninian: ......
2439,"Eliwood: Ninian, you must hide. We will meet the enemy!"
2440,"Dart: You're Mark, right? I'm Dart, leader of Fargus's suicide squad! The captain's ordered me to follow your commands. So, who do you want me to take care of?"
2441,"Rebecca: Um, Mark. Can I ask you something? Do you think Dart and I...have anything in common? What? Not at all? Hmmm... I don't know, there's something about him."
2442,"Uhai: Guuu... Well...done...... You are...stronger...stronger than I expected. Out of respect... ...a final gift from me... From here, go south. ...Turn at the rotted tree. Head...west. There lies the path to the... ...Dragon's Gate... Unnh..."
2443,Eliwood: Uhai... I wish we could've met under different circumstances.
2444,Hector: ...Do we trust him?
2445,"Lyn: He was a Sacaen. He would not lie. ...I, at least, choose to believe him."
2446,Hector: ...Let's go then.
2447,Eliwood: To the Dragon's Gate!
2448,"With Uhai's dying words still sounding in their ears, they venture deep into the forest's heart. Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious not to alert any hidden enemy. However, following on her path, a new Black Fang shadow appears.
"
2449,"Fiora: Honored tactician... Your name is Mark, correct? The enemy commander is readying his troops beyond that mountain. I can fly over the mountain and direct you, but... Getting too close could prove to be dangerous. Bear that in mind when you give me my orders."
2450,"Following Uhai's last words, Eliwood ventures toward the heart of the forest. He is greeted by an extraordinary sight. A building unlike any he's ever seen. It was clearly not wrought by human hands. It is waiting...waiting for the masters who abandoned it centuries past. Massive beyond belief, these ancient ruins have nothing to do with humankind. Eliwood has arrived. He has found the Dragon's Gate.

2453,Eliwood: ...We’re here. The Dragon’s Gate...
2454,Ninian: ......
2455,"Eliwood: What’s wrong, Ninian? You’re trembling."
2456,Ninian: ...This place... so frightening. Something... powerful...
2457,"Lyn: It’s her power, isn’t it?"
2458,Hector: Her power? What’s that?
2459,"Lyn: Ninian has the ability to sense impending danger. Her memory may be gone, but her power remains."
2460,"Eliwood: What is it you sense, Ninian?"
2461,Ninian: I... should not have... come here. Something awful will happen if I’m here. Ah!!
2462,Eliwood: Ninian!? Snap out of it!
2463,Ninian: This place... No... I... I...
2464,Eliwood: She’s getting worse! Let’s get her away from here!
2465,Ephidel (out of screen): You’ll not be going anywhere.
2466,"Ephidel: That little bird has escaped this island cage twice. Now that she’s back, she’ll not be allowed to fly away again."
2467,Eliwood: Who are you!?
2468,Ephidel: We meet at last. I am Ephidel. Pleased to make your acquaintance.
2469,Hector: You’re Ephidel? I’ve been looking forward to this.
2470,"Ephidel: ...Gallantly spoken. Of course, I know who you are. Marquess Ostia’s younger brother, Lord Hector. And here we have Caelin’s beloved princess, Lady Lyndis."
2471,Lyn: ......
2472,"Ephidel: By the way, the gift I left for you in the forest… Was is to your liking? The corpse of that filthy red-haired traitor?"
2473,Hector: Monster! Stay right there! I’m going to crush the life from you with my bare hands.
2474,"Ephidel: Now I see! She was an Ostian spy, wasn’t she? Don’t worry, she did not suffer. It only took one blow."
2475,Hector: Die‼
2476,Eliwood: He vanished‼
2477,Ninian: What--!?
2478,Ephidel: This girl is needed for my master’s ceremony.
2479,Eliwood: Ninian!
2480,Ninian: Lord Eliwood! Let me go!
2481,Lyn: Vanished...
2482,Hector: Blast!!
2483,Darin: Lord Ephidel! Is the girl with you?
2484,Ephidel: As you can see...
2485,Darin: Oho! The ritual can take place at last!
2486,"Ephidel: Yes. However, we have an infestation of mice to deal with… They should be scurrying in here momentarily. They must be dealt with before the ritual takes place. May I entrust this task to you?"
2487,"Darin: Of course. Who do you think I am?! I am Darin, Marquess Laus! Ruler of this world!"
2488,"Ephidel: Very well, I leave it to you."
2489,Darin: Ruler of the world... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
2490,Ephidel: Humans… They are so very fragile.
2491,Nergal: Ah... you’ve done well. Precious Ephidel. Shall we prepare for the ritual?
2492,Elbert: Nergal!!
2493,"Nergal: Does it gall you, Marquess Pherae? It’s destiny. There could be no other outcome. Despite all of your mischief, the girl was fated to return to me."
2494,Elbert: My son... Where is Eliwood?
2495,"Nergal: He’s still alive. Of course, it’s only a matter of time before the Black Fang finishes him."
2496,Elbert: ...Nergal! Prepare to die!!
2497,Nergal: Eh!?
2498,Jaffar: ...
2499,Elbert: Urrgg... grrr... haa...!!
2500,"Nergal: ...That was a surprise. When did he undo his bonds? Heh heh... Why do you not heed my warnings, Lord Elbert? You cannot alter destiny. Stop this foolishness."
2501,E lbert: ...Urrgh... grraa...
2502,"Nergal: Jaffar, take Marquess Pherae and the girl to the far chamber. I will begin preparations for the ritual."
2503,Jaffar: Thy will be done.
2504,"Cameron: I’ve been waiting for you, son of Pherae."
2505,Eliwood: Where is my father?
2506,"Cameron: Inside… He’s farther inside. You will never see him, though. Even if you break through here, the path you seek is guarded my Marquess Laus. Will you not withdraw? It’s too late for that, isn’t it? You’ll never leave here alive. Ha ha ha ha ha!"
2507,"Sain: Tactician! The final battle is approaching. That traitor, Laus… He harmed Lord Hausen, caused grief to Lady Lyndis… As a true knight of Caelin, I will make him pay! Leave him to me!!"
2508,"Kent: Mark, let me take the point. I will break through, even though it may cost me my life. If something does happen to me, Mark... Lady Lyndis... Please watch over her. Now, Mark, give me my orders!"
2509,"Enemy: Hey, you! What are you doing here?!"
2510,"Legault: What am I doing? Is that a proper greeting? If you don’t know me, you must be a new recruit, yes?"
2511,Enemy: Uh... I was assigned to the Dragon’s Gate about one month ago.
2512,"Legault: I thought as much. I am Legault. You’ve heard my name, yes?"
2513,Enemy: Legault... Ah! You... You’re the Hurricane? Second in ability to none but the Four Fangs?
2514,"Legault: Yes, yes. That’s me."
2515,Enemy: I... I beg your pardon.
2516,Legault: No worries.
2517,"Legault: ...Now then, time to fill my purse with treasure and leave the Black Fang behind. No sense staying on a sinking ship. No sense at all."
2518,"Legault: Well now, a welcome visitor, indeed. I must thank you for coming so far."
2519,Eliwood: What!? You’re a...
2520,"Legault: Mmm... To be accurate, I would say a former Black Fang member."
2521,Eliwood: Black Fang‼
2522,"Legault: Ha, no! ""Former"" Black Fang. Now I’m simply a thief."
2523,"Eliwood: Huh? So you’re not my foe, is that what you’re saying?"
2524,Legault: Correct. So let’s pretend we never saw each other.
2525,Eliwood: Hold on!
2526,Legault: Hm?
2527,"Eliwood: If you’re not my enemy, may I ask for your aid?"
2528,Legault: Me? Help you?
2529,Eliwood: I want to know about the Black Fang. ...Please.
2530,Legault: This is a surprise. Are you really going to battle the Black Fang?
2531,Eliwood: Yes.
2532,"Legault: Your enemy is not Brendan Reed, but a horrible man named Nergal."
2533,"Eliwood: Yes, I know this already."
2534,"Legault: You’re quite plucky. I like you! However, I know almost nothing of the current Black Fang. If you still want my aid..."
2535,Eliwood: I do! Thank you. My name’s Eliwood.
2536,Legault: I’m Legault. I’ll help you as long as I feel safe.
2537," Legault: Well now, a welcome visitor, indeed. I must thank you for coming so far."
2538," Lyn: What!? You’re Black Fang, aren't you?"
2539," Legault: Mmm... To be accurate, I would say a former Black Fang member."
2540, Lyn: Former...
2541, Legault: Yes. Now I’m simply a thief.
2542," Lyn: Huh? So you’re not my enemy, is that it?"
2543, Legault: Correct. So let’s pretend we never saw each other.
2544, Lyn: Hold on!
2545, Legault: Hm?
2546," Lyn: If you’re not my enemy, please help me."
2547, Legault: Me? Help you?
2548," Lyn: Not everyone in Black Fang is evil. I'll not grant mercy in battle, but any information you can provide may help us avoid unneeded fighting."
2549, Legault: You surprise me. Are you really looking not to hurt people?
2550, Lyn: The first person we fought on this island was Uhai... I don't believe he was a bad man. There must be some way we can get by without fighting.
2551, Legault: Hmmm... I know a few like that. Did you know that your enemy isn't Brendan Reed? It's a creepy fellow by the name of Nergal...
2552, Lyn: I was aware of that. That's the man we've come to defeat.
2553," Legault: ...Plucky, aren't you? I like that. I like you! However, I know almost nothing of the current Black Fang. If that's OK..."
2554, Lyn: Thank you. My name’s Lyn.
2555, Legault: I’m Legault. I’ll help you as long as I feel safe.
2556,Eliwood: Darin! Your treachery ends here!!
2557,Darin: Ha ha ha ha. I will never fall to the likes of you!!
2558,Darin: Oh... You’re Marquess Ostia’s younger brother...
2559,Hector: I couldn’t care less if you’ve a grudge against Ostia. I’ll put up with your treachery no longer!
2560,Darin: Heh heh heh… Ostia is no longer my main concern... Nor is the whole of Lycia... The only goal worthy of my attention is the entire world!
2561,Hector: You’re mad!!
2562,Lyn: Are you Darin? My grandfather… You tried to…
2563,Darin: What? Who are you?
2564,"Lyn: I am Marquess Caelin’s granddaughter, Lyndis!"
2565,Darin: Oh… that senile fool? …That doddering wreck dared disagree with me… I was so happy to be rid of him.
2566,Lyn: You’re a dead man!
2567,Lyn: He was mad.
2568,Hector: Consumed by his own lust... Pitiful fool.
2569,Eliwood: ...Lord Darin.
2570,"Hector: C’mon, Eliwood! This is no time for sentiment."
2571,Lyn: Your father needs you!
2572,Eliwood: ...Let’s go!
2573,Eliwood: Father!
2574,Eliwood: Father!? It’s me! Eliwood!! I’ve come to save you! ...Father?
2575,Hector: It’s dark in here. Can’t see a thing...
2576,Elbert: Eli... Eliwood...
2577,Eliwood: Ah!!
2578,Eliwood: Father! Where are you?
2579,Lyn: Back there! Eliwood!! His voice is coming from back there!!
2580,Eliwood: Ah! Father! You... You’re all right...
2581,Elbert: Eliwood... Wait! For-Forget me! Take that girl and flee!
2582,Eliwood: Ninian?!
2583,Ninian: ......
2584,"Elbert: That girl... She’s the key to the Dragon’s Gate. Hurry! Go, before Nergal notices you!"
2585,Eliwood: Ninian! This way! We must flee!
2586,Ninian: ......
2587,Lyn: Something’s wrong with her... Yet we’ve no time to hesitate.
2588,Hector: Eliwood! I’ve got your father! You take Ninian!
2589,Eliwood: I understand!
2590,Hector: Lord Elbert! I’m going to move you a little. Be strong.
2591,"Elbert: Hector… you came, too? ...Thank you."
2592,"Hector: Don’t worry about that. Come, let’s leave this place."
2593,Lyn: Eliwood! Hector!! Hurry! This way!! Ah!!
2594,Jaffar: ...... You will not pass here.
2595,Lyn: When did you?
2596,Elbert: You must not fight that man!!
2597,Lyn: What!?
2598,Elbert: That man... is dangerous. You cannot defeat him on your own.
2599,"Eliwood: Father, there’s no time. This danger must be faced."
2600,"Ephidel: ...Be a good boy, and listen to your father, young master Eliwood."
2601,Eliwood: Ephidel!!
2602,"Ephidel: Even among the Black Fang, this man is feared for his skill... You are no match for him, not even as a group. You’ve done well, Jaffar. That is all. Return to Bern and begin your next assignment."
2603,Jaffar: ......
2604,"Ephidel: Hear my word! I have an invitation from my master. In honor of your hard-fought arrival, he’s prepared a special show for you."
2605,Elbert: Stop it! You cannot release the dragons!!!
2606,Eliwood: Father? What’s all this about?
2607,Ephidel: ...You will know shortly. At the expense of your father’s life!
2608,Elbert: Guwaah! ...Gaa... ghaa...
2609,Eliwood: Father! What’s wrong? Father!
2610,Hector: Lord Elbert! Hold on!
2611,Eliwood: Huh? ...Ninian?
2612,Ninian: Pow... pow... er... ...power...
2613,Elbert: Gahaaa!
2614,Eliwood: Father!!!
2615,"Nergal: Now, Ninian… at last. Open the Dragon’s Gate."
2616,Ninian: ...Gate... Open... gate...
2617,"Nergal: Yes... that’s it... This way, dragon..."
2618,Hector: Whoa! What’s... What’s this rumbling!?
2619,Lyn: Unh! I can barely keep my feet!
2620,Eliwood: Nergal... What... What’s happening!?
2621,"Ninian: Here... Come, children of... flame. Come... to me..."
2622,Hector: ...It can’t be.
2623,Lyn: Ah... No... It isn’t...
2624,Eliwood: Is that... truly......... a dragon?
2625,Nergal: Ha ha ha ha ha! Yes! Use all your strength! Squeeze every drop from your body! You will call dragons!
2626,??: ...I will not allow this!!
2627,Ephidel: Who’s there?!
2628,Ephidel: …You!
2629,Lyn: Nils!
2630,Nils: Ninian! Come to your senses! You must not do what they want!
2631,Ninian: ...Ni... ......Nils...
2632,Nergal: Nils? Not now! Grrr... Ephidel! Stop him!!
2633,"Ephidel: Desist, Nils! The power... It runs wild!!"
2634,Nils: Ninian!!
2635,Ninian: ...... ...Nils?
2636,Nils: Here! Hurry!! The dragon is crumbling. Everyone flee!!
2637,Nergal: ......
2638,Ephidel: Hyaaaa! Stop… You mustn’t come here!! Lord Nergal! Lord Nergal! Please......!!! Guwaaaaaaahhh!!!!!!
2639,Hector: ...Something... happened.
2640,Eliwood: Is it... gone?
2641,"Nergal: No! I’ve failed! Nils, you whelp! If not for your interference... ...Come! Both of you!"
2642,Ninian: What? No!
2643,Nils: Never! We will not follow you!!
2644,Eliwood: Ninian! Nils!
2645,Nergal: Eh!!
2646,Elbert: You will... not!
2647,Nergal: What!? ...Impossible... Not... by your hand...
2648,Elbert: ...I told you. I will... oppose... you always...
2649,Nergal: ...Why... won’t... you... die? Nnn...
2650,Eliwood: Father!!
2651,Elbert: ...Eliwood. Be prepared. He will return...
2652,"Eliwood: All right, but for now... Let’s leave this island... Let’s go home."
2653,"Elbert: No, my son... I’m done here. You, Eliwood... You must finish this."
2654,"Eliwood: Don’t say that! Mother is waiting in Pherae... She’s waiting for you, Father!"
2655,Elbert: Ah... Eleanora... She will be cross with me. Eliwood... Your mother... I’m sorry... Tell her... I’m... sorry...
2656,Eliwood: Father?
2657,"Eliwood: No... Please, not now... Not after all we’ve done to find you again... Father... Please... Open your eyes......"
2658,Eliwood: Faaaatherrrrrrr!!!!
2659,"All of their battles have led them here. Now, at long last, they've finally reached the Dragon's Gate. Hector gains a brief respite before the decisive battle. Shortly thereafter, he noticed something... Ninian has gone missing. There! Her pale figure vanishes into the dark woods, her gait is unsteady, as though she were possessed. Hector quickly gives chase.

2668,Young Girl: ...Mommy? Where is she?

2678,Lyn: I'm not sure. But she said she knows this place. Could it have something to do with her amnesia?
2679,Hector: Why would she be familiar with anything on the Dread Isle?
2680,Eliwood: ...It's a very old building. It must have been abandoned for centuries...
2681,Hector: What about the Dragon's Gate? We're way off course now.
2682,Lyn: Ooh! You're so insensitive! This might restore Ninian's memory! Try and be a little patient!
2683,"Hector: Listen, aren't we in a bit of a hurry here? While we're wasting time, your father could be–"
2684,"Eliwood: It's OK, Hector. Let's see what happens."
2685,"Hector: He's too nice for his own good. You agree with me, right, Mark. Hm?"
2686,Teodor: Hello...
2687,Hector: You... Do you live here?
2688,"Teodor: No, I'm a simple traveler. I was walking in the woods and became tired. I was resting here. This building... It's been empty for a long time."
2689,Hector: Really? I think we'll take a rest here as well. Is that all right?
2690,"Teodor: Yes, of course."
2691,Hector: What is this place?
2692,"Teodor: It's a ruin from the Scouring... The residence of a dark sorcerer. I've found several ancient tomes here. Fascinating stuff, really. If I can unlock their secrets, I can move closer to the darkness. From what I've gathered so far, I must make further reparations."
2693,Eliwood: Reparations?
2694,"Teodor: Yes. It's the fate of those who study dark magic. If you covet the dark, you must enter it of your own free will. You must erase yourself and become an empty vessel. Only then will you be able to receive the dark and master it. If your disposition is weak, the dark will overwhelm you. You will be...lost... ...Ofttimes, you will forget why you seek the power to begin with. Only a few people ever gain true power. To win such a prize, one's self is a small and insignificant sacrifice."
2695,Eliwood: ......
2696,"Teodor: I've heard rumors... Bramimond, one of the eight legends, devoted himself entirely to the dark. All emotion, all memory... dissolved in a river of dark. That is how he received the power to best dragons."
2697,Eliwood: ...I don't understand. Why would anyone want power at the cost of his own identity?
2698,"Teodor: ""I must have it at any cost."" I believe every living soul has felt such desire. I know I have. Have you not, Lord Eliwood of Pherae?"
2699,Eliwood: What?!?
2700,Hector: You... It was you!?
2701,"Teodor: Uhai and Aion's deaths were convenient... Your exhaustion is even more convenient... I, Teodor, lay claim to the deed of killing the young noble of Pherae. When I'm done, I will examine this building's treasures at my leisure."
2702,Lyn: Black...fog? I can't see anything!
2703,Hector: Blast! Those used to this ink will have an advantage...
2704,Lyn: Ninian!! She's gone!! Do you think they took Ninian?
2705,"Eliwood: Let's go, Hector!"
2706,Hector: All right! That scum... No Black Fang must be allowed to live!!
2707,Hector: That about wraps this up. Eliwood? How about over there?
2708,Eliwood: Fine. But...where is Ninian? Has anyone seen her?
2709,Lyn: I found her! She's inside.
2710,Hector: Hm? Why isn't she with you?
2711,"Lyn: There's a library filled with ancient books inside. She's been in there, staring at a picture. I can't get her to move."
2712,Eliwood: What kind of picture?
2713,Lyn: A picture of a dragon and a human.
2714,Hector: From the Scouring? We've got a lot of those in Castle Ostia.
2715,"Lyn: No, it's not a picture of the actual fighting. It shows a single human and a single dragon. ...It's a very eerie picture."
2716,Eliwood: ...It must have belonged to the dark sorcerer who used to live here.
2717,Lyn: I wonder what kind of person that magic user was...
2718,Ninian: ......
2719,Eliwood: Ninian! Are you ready?
2720,"Ninian: Yes, um... I'm sorry for the trouble..."
2721,Lyn: Well? Did you...remember something?
2722,"Ninian: There's... No, nothing. I'm sorry......"
2723,Eliwood: Don't push yourself. You'll remember soon enough.
2724,Lyn: That's right! Cheer up!
2725,Ninian: Yes...
2726,"Hector: Let's get moving! We've been fighting since we got here. If we make it to the Dragon's Gate, we win. We've got to rescue your father!"
2727,Eliwood: Right!
2728,"Nergal: What is this place? I was supposed to be at the Dragon's Gate. Why am I here? Ah... Now I remember. I was here a long, long time ago... During the Scouring... I studied dark magic here. This... I left something here. Something valuable... Urrgg... My head... The pain... Bah. It must not be worth much if I never bothered returning for it. I have power now. Nothing else matters. I will open the Dragon's Gate and get even more power... The power to defeat anyone. Power..."
2729,"At last, Eliwood's long-awaited reunion with his father, as well as their painful farewell. After escaping the Dread Isle, they return to the port city of Badon. Eliwood remains silent for the duration of their passage. He sits cradling his father's cold hand as if to warm him back to life.
"
2730,"They find the man for whom they've been searching, Marquess Pherae. He breathes his last in the embrace of his son, Eliwood. The companions leave the Dragon's Gate and set sail for Badon. Eliwood is grief-stricken at his father's death. Hector can find no words to comfort his friend.
"
2731,"Lyn: ...Ninian, are you feeling better?"
2732,Ninian: Yes…
2733,"Lyn: That’s good. ...Long time, no see, Nils. You’ve grown, haven’t you?"
2734,"Nils: ...Is it really you, Lyndis? It seems like it’s been so long."
2735,Lyn: Even though it’s only been a year since I saw you last?
2736,Nils: So much has happened since we left you and Caelin.
2737,"Hector: Hey, care to talk about things the rest of us can follow?"
2738,Nils: Hmph. Who’s he?
2739,"Lyn: This is Hector. He’s Marquess Ostia’s brother. Don’t let his attitude fool you. He acts mean, but he’s decent enough."
2740,Hector: Acts mean seems pretty mean to me!
2741,Lyn: Heehee… And you might remember this one. He’s...
2742,"Nils: Yep, I remember. He’s the man who helped Ninian. You’re Elbert’s son, aren’t you? Your red hair, gentle eyes, and even voice. You’re just like him."
2743,Eliwood: Where did you meet my father?
2744,"Nils: At the Dragon’s Gate. He set us free after we’d been captured. We escaped in a small boat, but I was thrown out in a storm. When I woke up, I was back on Valor. For a time, I hid in the ruins by myself. Then... I sensed something really dangerous. When I raced to the Dragon’s Gate, I... I saw everything."
2745,Ninian: ...Nils.
2746,"Lyn: When we pulled Ninian from the boat, she’d lost her memory. I can’t believe we brought her right back to her captors. What a horrible thing to do. ...I’m sorry."
2747,"Ninian: Lady Lyn... Lady Lyn, you did nothing wrong...... When Nils fell overboard, I didn’t know what to do. ...I became lost within myself. If only I’d been stronger... ......All of this could have been avoided... I am... truly... sorry."
2748,"Nils: …Ninian’s power is greater than mine, but it costs her physical and emotional strength. ......Nergal exploited that... weakness..."
2749,Lyn: ...Ninian... Nils...
2750,Eliwood: ...Was he after you because you have the power to call dragons?
2751,Nils: ...I think it’s because we can open the Dragon’s Gate. Just calling them? Nergal can do that on his own.
2752,Hector: Are you serious?
2753,"Nils: Yes, but it requires a tremendous amount of quintessence."
2754,Lyn: Quintessence?
2755,"Nils: That’s what Nergal called it. The substance of the human spirit... Power. Energy. The essence of life itself. ...Nergal, he stole this quintessence."
2756,Hector: ...What happens to those whose quintessence is stolen?
2757,Nils: ...They... They die...
2758,Lyn: ......
2759,"Nils: Neither Ninian nor I have that power. Lyn knows. We only have our special power... Anyway, Nergal needed to gather a large amount of quintessence. So he sent his henchman, Ephidel, to get close to Marquess Laus. He sought to plant the seeds of war in Darin’s power-hungry heart."
2760,Eliwood: ...To what end?
2761,"Nils: It seems the quintessence in each person varies in strength. A person of strong mind and body has hundreds of times more energy than the average person. It sounds like there aren’t many people like that, though. It took too long for Nergal to find people with enough strength. Although it would take time, Nergal said the easiest way to get that much quintessence was by starting a war."
2762,Hector: ...So he planned to make up for quality with quantity? Is that it? Black-hearted fiend! Are all men nothing but pawns to him?
2763,"Nils: ...Ephidel brought Elbert to the Dragon’s Gate. He said he’d found the ideal source they had sought. Nergal’s plans for war had been stopped, and yet... he was happy. He’d taken so much energy from the knights traveling with Elbert. He was sure he’d get even better quintessence from Elbert..."
2764,Lyn: Nils!
2765,"Nils: Oh, I’m sorry... Lord Eliwood."
2766,"Eliwood: It’s all right... ...When I found my father at the Dragon’s Gate, I knew his knights were no longer alive..."
2767,Hector: Eliwood...
2768,Nils: ...Your father told us that he had a son. He said you were blessed with natural fighting ability. But he also told us you were compassionate and disdained fighting. He told us that his son would be a better ruler than he was.
2769,Lyn: ......
2770,"Nils: He told us that he would sooner sacrifice himself than see his homeland, Lycia, embroiled in the flames of war."
2771,Eliwood: ...That’s...
2772,"Nils: When we’d lost all hope at the Dragon’s Gate, your father always spoke to us of happy things. ...Well, he mainly spoke of his cherished son and his dear wife, but Ninian and I... We loved him very much. His stories about his family... ...They saved us."
2773,"Eliwood: Oh, Fa-- ...Father... ......"
2774,Hector: ...
2775,Lyn: ...Hector?
2776,Hector: We should let him be alone for a while…
2777,"Lyn: ...Sure. Come on, Ninian, Nils."
2778,Nils: …As you say.
2779,Ninian: ...Lord Eliwood...
2780,Eliwood: Hm? Ninian... I didn’t see you. I’m sorry about before. I just... needed some time to think.
2781,Ninian: ...
2782,Eliwood: Should you be up? You’ve had a rough time... Your coloring’s not very good. You should rest.
2783,Ninian: ...
2784,"Eliwood: ...Look at you, all scratches and bruises... You need to be properly taken care of..."
2785,Ninian: ...Why?
2786,Eliwood: Hm?
2787,"Ninian: Why was Lord Elbert so… Lord Eliwood, why were you both... so kind to us? It's... This is… This is all my fault… These nightmares... All these terrible things..."
2788,"Eliwood: Ninian, crying ill suits a girl of your beauty. I’m fine... Please don’t cry."
2789,Ninian: I’m sorry... So... sorry...
2790,Eliwood: There’s something you must hear. You’re not responsible for what happened to my father. You suffered as much as he did. Please don’t punish yourself further.
2791,Ninian: ...Lord Eliwood... I... I... Ah!!
2792,Eliwood: Huh? What is it?
2793,Ninian: ...Oh...
2794,Eliwood: Ninian?
2795,Ninian: ...Enemies... ......Enemies draw near!!
2796,"Hector: So, what do we do now?"
2797,Lyn: I wonder what happened to Nergal. Lord Elbert gave him a grievous wound when he stabbed him.
2798,Nils: His wounds will not kill him.
2799,"Hector: That’s what Lord Elbert said, too. Do you know what he meant?"
2800,Nils: Nergal uses quintessence on himself as well. His wounds heal quickly. …His body does not age.
2801,Lyn: So he isn’t... human?
2802,"Nils: ...If nothing else, he’s... Ah!!"
2803,Hector: What is it?
2804,Nils: Call everyone! Enemies approach!
2805,Eliwood: Bah. Eliwood deserves a little more time to rest...
2806,"Lyn: Well then, we’ll handle this ourselves, shall we?"
2807,Eliwood: Here you all are!
2808,Hector: Ah!
2809,Lyn: Eliwood!
2810,"Eliwood: Listen! Get ready for battle! I want to get this over with quickly to protect villagers. Meet the enemy commander, and drive them out of here!!"
2811,"Hector: Het, little guy! Go hide in the village!"
2812,Nils: No way! I can help you out!
2813,"Lyn: Nils, you really are a big help, but... shouldn’t you be with Ninian now?"
2814,Nils: Ah... All right!
2815,Eliwood: Let’s go!
2816,Nils: Ninian! Stop! Where are you going?
2817,Ninian: I... I’m going to help!
2818,"Nils: Oh, no, you’re not! You’re still too weak!"
2819,Ninian: But... I merely wish to help Lord Eliwood… Even if just a little. I... I stole his father’s life from him... ...I know this... this will never make up for it... Nils! Please...
2820,Nils: ...I understand. Give me your hands.
2821,Ninian: Nils?
2822,Nils: I’ll give you some of my power. You’ll just get in the way if you go out like this.
2823,"Ninian: Nils, I’m sorry."
2824,"Nils: ...Whew! That should do it. Help them for me, too."
2825,Ninian: Thank you.
2826,Ninian: Lord Eliwood!
2827,Eliwood: Ninian!? You shouldn’t be here!!
2828,Ninian: ...Please allow me to help.
2829,Eliwood: Help? I’ve no intention of making you fight...
2830,Ninian: ...I’m no mere dancer. My dances... They will help you.
2831,Eliwood: ...This is...... I’m wrapped in... some sort of... energy...
2832,"Ninian: I used Ninis’s Grace and danced for you, Lord Eliwood. It will only last a short while, but while it does, you are protected. ...Please... allow me... to remain at your side."
2833,Eliwood: Ninian... Of course. If it will make you feel better. Let’s rejoin the battle. Don’t leave my side.
2834,Ninian: OK!
2835,"Ninian: Mark, please tell me what you want me to do. I cannot fight, but... I can aid with my dance. I ask for your understanding and assistance."
2836,"Man: Can’t believe Badon’s under attack. If only Fargus were here... Say, I’ve got something here you can use to buy some time. Set this Light Rune, and it’ll block the enemies’ advance. Only thing is, it’ll stop allies, too. So... watch your step!"
2837,"Man: Ah... Those emerald eyes, that lustrous blue hair... She was... so beautiful, beautiful beyond words… If only I could see her again... A lovely knight of Pherae, searching for her lord... ...I wonder why she’s a knight. A famed knight and me, that’s a dream of a dream... Wah! You... I... I was just thinking out loud... You... didn’t hear anything, did you? Waaaaaaaaa! You mustn’t tell anyone! Promise me! You mustn’t!!"
2838,"Woman: Why all the noise? It’s the middle of the night!! What? A fight? Are you going to do something? Really? Then... here, take this. It should aid you. It’s a Restore staff. It’ll wake you from sleep and cure poison. Basically, it’ll cure what’s wrong and bring you back to normal. Now I’m tired... Why can’t you people fight at a decent hour?"
2839,Man: Are you a mercenary? You all look like you’ve been fighting for years and years. What kind of tactician would put together a group like yours?
2840,"Man: Hey! Wasn’t that a wyvern rider that flew by here a while back!? I want to know what Bern’s wyvern riders are doing here! Are we under attack? C’mon, do something! I’ve heard that wyvern riders are fast and really tough. Sure, arrows and magic can bring them down, but... This’ll cause ‘em trouble, too! It’s a wyrmslayer. Here! Take care of ‘em!"
2841,"Man: You need special items to change classes. The item’s different for different units, too. Cavaliers and knights need a Knight crest. Folks skilled in magic and staves need a Guiding ring. And wyvern riders and Pegasus knights need this: an Elysian whip. You can have it. Don’t be shy now. It’s not like I’ll ever be able to use it. Now, if I were a cute little Pegasus knight, I’d use it in an instant!"
2842,Eliwood: ...Black Fang?
2843,"Oleg: I bring an invitation from my master, Nergal. ""Return the children to me."" Seems foolish to deliver the message... After all, I can take them both myself and go now!"
2844,Eliwood: You’ll never take them!!
2845,"Hector: Hey, are you OK?"
2846,Eliwood: Mm. Sorry to worry you.
2847,Lyn: You don’t have to push yourself so.
2848,"Eliwood: We’ll have time for mourning when this is all finished. For now, in my father’s name... I will do everything I can to stop Nergal and protect our lands."
2849,Hector: I see. So what do you have in mind?
2850,Eliwood: ...We need to see Marquess Ostia.
2851,Hector: My brother?
2852,"Eliwood: After all we’ve learned... We can’t not tell him, can we?"
2853,"Hector: Sure, I guess..."
2854,Lyn: Hector? Why that odd expression?
2855,"Eliwood: Hector doesn’t want to meet Lord Uther. He’s been lax in contacting him and is afraid to face him, right?"
2856,Hector: What! And how did you expect me to send him messages when we’re traipsing about the isles like merchants on holidays?
2857,Eliwood: Ha ha ha! He is going to be so mad!!
2858,Hector: C’mere!
2859,"Lyn: Ha... They’re both in good spirits. ...It’s a lot better than giving in to despair, I suppose."
2860,Marcus: Lord Eliwood... Are you feeling better?
2861,Eliwood: Marcus... I’m fine. I know I worried you.
2862,"Marcus: About Lord Elbert... At my own discretion, I sent a messenger to Lady Eleanora."
2863,"Eliwood: ...I see. Thank you, Marcus. That was well done."
2864,Marcus: ...I thought she should know as soon as possible. The marquess’s final moments were so... very noble...
2865,Eliwood: ......
2866,??: Lord Eliwood! Commander Marcus!!
2867,Eliwood: Ah!!
2868,"Marcus: Is... Is that you, Isadora?!"
2869,Isadora: I’ve finally found you. I’m glad you’re well...
2870,"Eliwood: Isadora, what are you doing here? Don’t tell me something’s happened to Mother..."
2871,"Isadora: No, Lady Eleanora is well. Do not worry. When word of Lord Elbert’s death reached her yesterday... She said not a word... She merely gave her full attention to the messenger."
2872,Eliwood: ...Mother.
2873,"Isadora: Then, she issued me orders without hesitation. She commanded I deliver this sword to Lord Eliwood and remain at his side."
2874,Eliwood: But... the castle defenses will be shorthanded.
2875,"Isadora: Lord Eliwood... please... Understand your mother’s feelings. Lord Elbert is not coming home. All your mother can do now is pray for your continued safety. ""Obey your father’s dying wish."" That is her message to you, and I have delivered it."
2876,Marcus: Why not petition Ostia for reinforcements to help ward Castle Pherae?
2877,Eliwood: ...Good idea. I guess it would ease my mother’s fears and bow to her wishes.
2878,Isadora: It’s that thinking that makes you Lord Eliwood.
2879,"Eliwood: Our battles are like nothing you’ve ever prepared for. ...Are you ready to face them, Isadora?"
2880,Isadora: Yes. I will serve with my very life.
2881,"Eliwood: Tactician? Is something wrong? Oh, you were worried about me. I apologize for all of the trouble. I’m fine now. I have my friends to lean on. Hector, Lyndis, and you, Tactician... Thanks to all of you, I’m getting stronger. I am coming to believe that together, we can overcome anything!"
2882,Nergal: Sonia. Limstella.
2883,"Sonia: You called, Lord Nergal?"
2884,Limstella: ......
2885,"Nergal: My wound... needs time. It was a deep cut, and my strength is not what it was. The man who did this to me is dead. I’d like his son’s death as compensation. Sonia. You will use Brendan to move the Black Fang. I do not need mere underlings now. I need the Four Fangs."
2886,"Sonia: Hee hee, leave it to me. I’ll have them bowing their heads to you, my lord."
2887,"Nergal: Limstella. I want you to gather me quintessence. For this injury to heal, I will need much. You are the strongest of all my morphs. Kill all those who bear signs of great power."
2888,Limstella: As you will...
2889,"Eliwood travels westward to meet with Uther, the marquess of Ostia. They pass through Laus and continue through two more territories. After a time, they arrive at a fortress separating Thria and Ostia.
"
2890,"The group travels west to meet with Lord Uther, the marquess of Ostia. Lord Uther is an intelligent leader and power in the Lycian League. He has also been a father to Hector, ever since their parents died many years ago. Hector's reunion with his brother is a happy one, if somewhat embarrassing. Hector continues his journey filled with complex emotions. At length, they arrive at a fortress that separates Thria and Ostia.
"
2891,"Sonia: Jaffar. Ursula. Lloyd. Linus. That's everyone, is it not? If I have you, the Four Fangs, together, I need no one else. I have need of you to eliminate a man whose living plagues me. His name is Eliwood, a noble of Pherae."
2892,Jaffar: ......
2893,"Ursula: ...Pherae's located in Lycia, is it not?"
2894,"Sonia: That's right. But he is no simple country lord. He has friends. Other Lycian lords. Individually, they are no match for you, and yet... Carelessness invites death."
2895,Ursula: Do not make that mistake.
2896,"Sonia: Lloyd, Linus... I have work for you, the Reed brothers, as well. All right?"
2897,Lloyd: One question. Are these our father's ord--I mean... the orders of the head of the Black Fang?
2898,"Sonia: Hee hee... Why, naturally. Isn't that right, my beloved?"
2899,Brendan: Mmm... Ah...yes.
2900,"Sonia: There! Are you satisfied? Remove Eliwood. Your orders come from the head of the Black Fang, Brendan Reed. As members of this group, you will follow that order, yes? Or...does your opponent frighten you into immobility, Lloyd?"
2901,Linus: Sonia! How dare you speak to my brother in such a...
2902,Lloyd: Linus.
2903,Linus: ...I know.
2904,"Lloyd: Sonia, we do not need to be chastised by you. Under our father, we are the ones who've carried out the law of the Fang. If Eliwood is an evil person, there is no reason for us to hesitate."
2905,Linus: The Fang lets none escape.
2906,"Lloyd: We, the brothers Reed, dispense the Fang's justice."
2907,"Sonia: ......Ursula, Jaffar, you understand your orders, yes? Once you find the target, you eliminate him at once!"
2908,"Ursula: It will be as you say, Lady Sonia. Anything for you."
2909,Jaffar: ...I've received my orders. I will do my duty.
2910,"Sonia: Your target's name is Eliwood, noble of Pherae! Bring him down. On the Black Fang's honor!"
2911,Hector: ...I've heard word from my brother. He's already on his way here. We're to wait for him.
2912,Eliwood: Lord Uther is coming here himself?
2913,"Hector: So it appears. I told you of this before, but Castle Ostia, not to mention the city itself, is filled with countless foreign spies. I assume he thinks it will be easier to speak freely here."
2914,Eliwood: But...wouldn't leaving Ostia generate even more attention?
2915,Hector: He's traveling in secret with very few attendants. He's skilled at this sort of thing. There's no need to worry.
2916,Lyn: How unconventional. It must run in the family.
2917,Hector: ...And what exactly is that supposed to mean?
2918,Lyn: Nothing. I'm very much looking forward to meeting him.
2919,"Ninian: Nils, are you well? You seem...distant."
2920,"Nils: I'm fine. Just a little tired. If we can sit still for one night, I'll be bet...ter..."
2921,Ninian: No! Nils!? Nils!!
2922,Lyn: Nils!?
2923,Hector: Nils! You all right?
2924,Ninian: Nils!! Open your eyes!
2925,Eliwood: Ninian! Calm down!
2926,"Ninian: ...Ah, I......"
2927,Hector: Let's move him into the back room and call a healer.
2928,Ninian: You mustn't move him!
2929,Hector: Huh?
2930,Lyn: Ninian?
2931,"Ninian: I'm sorry, I... Um... Please, just for now... Don't move him."
2932,Hector: But...
2933,Ninian: Please...
2934,Eliwood: ...Let's do as Ninian says. She must have her reasons.
2935,"Ninian: ...Please, just one night's rest... That should...make things right."
2936,"Hector: If it's going to make him feel better, fine. Whatever you do, don't move him. I'll let the others know."
2937,Ninian: Lord Hector.......My apologies.
2938,Hector: No worries.
2939,"Eubans: ...So this is where the Pheraen noble and his friends are, eh?"
2940,"Heath: Yes, Commander Eubans."
2941,"Eubans: Very well, Heath, your unit will attack from west of the fortress. Your mission is to put an end to the entire group. Make no mistakes."
2942,Heath: ...Are you serious? Marquess Laus abandoned us and just vanished. We've no reason to engage this group.
2943,"Eubans : We answered Marquess Laus's call, and we will honor our duty. Regardless, we cannot remain in Lycia any longer. We rebelled against Ostia, and our entire mercenary force is hunted... If we take their heads, we can join the Black Fang in Bern."
2944,Heath: I'm opposed to this plan. There are women and children in their group. What you would ask of us... It's something no knight... no man could do without shame.
2945,"Eubans: Listen well, Heath. You're a wanted man, a fugitive from Bern. How about we take you and hand you over to Bern's wyvern riders? We might even be knighted as a reward, given honest work."
2946,Heath: ......
2947,"Eubans: Hah! Thought as much. Everyone wants to protect his own skin. Now, get your unit together. We attack!!"
2948,Soldier: Sir! We're under attack! It's the east gate! The foe is already inside!
2949,Hector: Blast! They would show up now.
2950,Eliwood: We can't move Nils. Let's try and hold them off! Protect Nils! Don't let them near him!
2951,"Isadora: You're Tactician, correct? Lord Eliwood has told me much about you. I'm a knight in service to House Pherae. My name is Isadora. I'm under your command. Please instruct me."
2952,"Wil: Shall I join the battle this time, Mark? I can’t wait! Ah, this brings back memories, doesn’t it? Kind of like we’re back with Lyndis’s Legion again. OK, Mark! Guide my arrows true!"
2953,"Rath: ...So you're being hunted again, are you, Lyn of the Lorca?"
2954,Lyn: Rath! Rath of the Kutolah! Well met! What are you doing here?
2955,"Rath: ...After we parted company, I've made my way as a mercenary here."
2956,Lyn: I see... You haven't changed at all. It's...good to see you again.
2957,Rath: ...Do you need my help?
2958,Lyn: Are you offering?
2959,Rath: ...You...If you desire it.
2960,"Lyn: Yes, please! Lend us your strength! We're...involved in something terribly dangerous!"
2961,"Rath: I see. When this is finished, I will end my service to this place."
2962,Heath: Do you command this group?
2963,Eliwood: Who are you?
2964,"Heath: I'm Heath, a wyvern rider serving Eubans's mercenaries. I wish to surrender."
2965,Eliwood: Surrender? Why?
2966,"Heath: I've no wish to harm women and children. I'm a soldier, but... I'm trying to be human, too."
2967,"Eliwood: ...I understand. However, as you know, we're under attack. It will be hard to guarantee your safety."
2968,"Heath: No, that's fine. I will fight alongside you."
2969,Eliwood: Yet...
2970,"Heath: I will stop Commander Eubans when the moment comes... With this, my lance."
2971,Heath: Do you command this group?
2972,Hector: Who are you to ask?
2973,"Heath: I'm Heath, a wyvern rider serving Eubans's mercenaries."
2974,"Hector: In that case, you're my enemy. You're gutsy, aren't you? Prepare yourself!"
2975,Heath: Hold. I've not come to fight you. I wish to surrender to your group.
2976,Hector: Surrender?
2977,"Heath: I've no wish to harm women and children. I'm a soldier, but... I'm trying to be human, too."
2978,"Hector: ...You're an odd one. Right, well. We could use all the help we can get. You'll fight under my command."
2979,Heath: Understood.
2980,Heath: You're...a woman?
2981,"Lyn: What!? Underestimate me, and you'll find you die regretting it! Now come, if you've the nerve!"
2982,"Heath: Hold, I am not here to fight you. I'd sooner surrender."
2983,Lyn: Surrender? You're giving up? Why?
2984,Heath: I've no wish to harm women and children.
2985,"Lyn: ......I understand. We're no army. I won't hold you prisoner. If you're not going to fight, go someplace where you'll be safe. However, you are welcome to join us and fight at our side. We're trying to protect a sick child traveling with us."
2986,Heath: I see...and I will help you protect this child.
2987,Ninian: Ah...
2988,"Heath: A girl... This place is dangerous, you should flee quickly."
2989,Ninian: ......
2990,Heath: ...Wait! Do you know the commander of these forces?
2991,Ninian: Ah...Yes...
2992,"Heath: Then deliver a message for me, please. I am Heath, a wyvern rider in Eubans's mercenaries. Tell him I want to join your group. I will fight with you."
2993,Ninian: Wait... Why?
2994,Heath: I've no wish to harm women and children.
2995,"Eubans: You are a traitor, Heath. You know nothing of honor!"
2996,Heath: I... No. I simply must live a life of which I am not ashamed. Commander Eubans... It is not too late. Give the order to stop. If you do...
2997,"Eubans: Ha ha... You're so naive! You're no knight. And you're no mercenary, either, you dolt! You know nothing! You can carry your precious morals straight to the grave!"
2998,Eubans: No regrets... My life...and death...are my own!
2999,Soldier: Commander Eubans has gone down... Uh... Sound the retreat!! We've no more reason to fight!!
3000,"Uther: So, brother, you're alive after all. You were so long gone that I feared you dead. Another day, and I might have arranged you a funeral rite."
3001,Hector: ...My apologies. Been a little busy.
3002,Uther: Yes...Leila's final report covered much. ...Eliwood. I am sorry about Lord Elbert. I was powerless to help.
3003,"Eliwood: No... Nothing could have been done. ...More importantly, do you know of Nergal?"
3004,Uther: Only what was reported to me. He appeared a year ago and seized control of the Black Fang. Then he ensnared Laus in a plot of rebellion against Ostia. I can't see what he's after...
3005,Eliwood: The dragons that vanished after the Scouring... He wants to...bring them back again.
3006,Uther: What!? Can that be done?
3007,Eliwood: Yes. Let me explain.
3008,Hector: This has even got my brother brooding. He's always been a firm believer in quick decisions. Yet he wishes for more time...that's never happened before.
3009,"Lyn: ...It's gone from a simple rebellion to a threat to the human race. We saw it with our own eyes, and yet... It's all so unbelievable."
3010,Eliwood: Yet...it's all true.
3011,"Hector: Yes. I wonder what will happen next. Ideally, we could bring the whole of our lands together to fight as one. It would be a return to the time of the Scouring..."
3012,"Eliwood: However, this all hinges on the existence of dragons themselves. Unless dragons are seen in the skies, I doubt anyone will believe us."
3013,Lyn: Right. And once the dragons are here it'll be too late.
3014,Eliwood: We must stop all of this now. And we're the only ones who know enough to do it!
3015,Hector: Right!
3016,Lyn: I agree.
3017,"Hector: There we have it! Come on, let's speak to my brother!"
3018,Eliwood: Tactician. Ninian. Will you go with us?
3019,Ninian: Ye-Yes...
3020,"Uther: I would sooner not place this burden on your shoulders alone. And yet, I can see no other choice before me. Listen, my brother... Eliwood, Lyndis, are you determined to act on your resolve?"
3021,"Eliwood: Yes, we're prepared."
3022,"Lyn: Me, too... I don't care for sitting back, waiting for others to act."
3023,"Uther: And you, Tactician. My brother and his friends are in your debt. What role will you play? Will you help them? See them through their coming trials? ...I see. Then I have no more to say. I will aid you as much as I can. ...Good luck to you all. ...And what of the girl? The one we spoke of earlier?"
3024,"Ninian: Oh, Ninian."
3025,"Ninian: It... It's an honor to meet you, Marquess Ostia..."
3026,"Hector: Both Ninian and her brother, Nils, possess a special power."
3027,Uther: Is that so? Then I would ask you. Do you know where Nergal is at this moment?
3028,"Ninian: Yes, I can sense him... To the east... He is...very far."
3029,Lyn: East... Is he targeting Bern next?
3030,Uther: That bodes ill. Bern is a powerful and militant country. If Nergal ensnares it... We're done for.
3031,Ninian: ...There's still time. He is still... very weak...... Now... We must act......
3032,"Lyn: So, Nergal can't act right away, is that it? Yet, what can we..."
3033,Hector: We've no choice but to depart for Bern.
3034,"Uther: ...If there's time, make your destination Missur."
3035,Hector: Missur!? That's the wrong direction!
3036,Uther: Go to the Nabata desert... You may find aid there.
3037,Eliwood: What do you mean?
3038,Uther: Go and meet the living legend.
3039,Eliwood: Living...legend?
3040,"The Nabata Desert. A wasteland of scorching sun and frigid nights. It rejects human life. Any careless enough to enter its embrace is doomed to wander lost. Uther, the marquess of Ostia, spoke of a living legend… Guided by his words, Eliwood heads straight into the desert.

"
3042,"Scene transition over to Ninian and Eliwood)
"
3043,Nils: ...So hot. I'm...going to die.
3044,"Hector: Hey, do you want me to carry you on my back?"
3045,Nils: Huh?
3046,Hector: Why are you looking at me like that?
3047,"Nils: Such kindness from you surprised me, Lord Hector. Is this some fever dream?"
3048,"Hector: What's that supposed to mean? I was concerned that you might collapse again, like the other day."
3049,"Lyn: You're usually so brusque. It's no wonder he's confused. Don't be shy, Nils. Let him help you out."
3050,Nils: ...But...
3051,"Hector: Do as you're told, boy!"
3052,Nils: Waaa!! Waaaaaaa!!! I'm going to fall! I'm going to fall!!!
3053,"Ninian: ...Marquess Ostia said, ""Enter the desert and move west. Someone will meet you."" ...And yet we've seen no one."
3054,Eliwood: I wonder if we need to move farther in?
3055,Ninian: ...You might be right.
3056,Eliwood: Here.
3057,Ninian: What?
3058,"Eliwood: This heat is taking its toll on you. If you please, take my arm."
3059,Ninian: I couldn't...
3060,"Eliwood: Oh, come now."
3061,Ninian: ...Very well. Forgive me... ......
3062,Eliwood: Hm? Is something wrong?
3063,Ninian: ...It's strange.
3064,Eliwood: What is?
3065,Ninian: All of you treat my brother and me so...normally. Doesn't it bother you? Our powers...our looks... We're different from...people...
3066,"Eliwood: Has that been bothering you? What's wrong with being a bit different from other people? When I look at you, I don't see other people. I see Ninian. I see a normal, kindhearted girl."
3067,Ninian: Do you speak truly?
3068,Eliwood: Mm.
3069,Ninian: Lord Eliwood.
3070,Athos: ...I believe someone approaches.
3071,Louise: Is it Lord Pent?
3072,"Athos: No, it's a group sent by Uther of Ostia. Hawkeye will find them soon and bring them here. Hmph. Your companion is still searching in the desert."
3073,"Louise: He's not having any luck finding what he's after, is he?"
3074,"Athos: No, I believe he'll find it before long. ...However, a group of bandits is also moving. They've found Pent and are preparing to attack."
3075,"Louise: Oh, that's..."
3076,Athos: Are you concerned for his safety?
3077,"Louise: No, Lord Pent can take care of himself. However, if his return here is delayed..."
3078,Athos: Yes?
3079,"Louise: Will you take your evening meal without us? I will wait for Lord Pent, but I'm sure you must be hungry."
3080,Athos: Ha ha ha ha...
3081,Louise: Lord Athos? What is it?
3082,"Athos: ...It's you, Louise. You are a most amusing woman. Since Pent brought you here, I feel I've laughed enough for ten years! You have my gratitude."
3083,"Louise: Hm? I'm not sure I understand, but I'm pleased to have been of service."
3084,Athos: Ha ha ha.
3085,"Louise: By the way, the visitors are coming from Lycia, aren't they? I wonder what they want."
3086,Athos: ......
3087,"Louise: Lord Archsage, your coloring... Are you well?"
3088,"Athos: Once it begins to turn, none can halt the wheel of fate. But as long as there is hope, people continue to try. ...They do not know the despair that awaits..."
3089,Louise: ......
3090,"Ninian: Um, Lord Eliwood?"
3091,Eliwood: Ninian?
3092,Ninian: Over there... Someone is under attack.
3093,Eliwood: Are you sure?
3094,Hector: Ah! That must be him!
3095,Eliwood: Looks like.....a lone man and a crowd of bandits.
3096,Lyn: Let's help him! I dislike seeing someone facing overwhelming odds!
3097,"Hector: Hold on, Lyn! I'm going with you!"
3098,"Eliwood: Hey, you two!"
3099,Nils: Where do they get all that energy? Unbelievable.
3100,Ninian: ...What will you do?
3101,"Eliwood: Let's go! Have to keep up with one's friends, right?"
3102,"Paul: Oh, look at this kindly soul, Jasmine! He's waiting all by himself to give us his treasure!"
3103,"Jasmine: Oho, Paul! I do believe you're right! Such generosity!!"
3104,Pent: ...It's taken me many days to find this. I've worked too hard to hand this over to you thugs.
3105,"Paul: So rude... And to think we were going to let you live... We're fragile creatures! You can't trifle with our emotions so! You're a bad man! He's so bad, Jasmine!"
3106,"Jasmine: Oh, Paul. I know it. I really do. My heart, it is breaking."
3107,"Paul: What? You, too, Jasmine?"
3108,"Jasmine: And you as well, Paul?"
3109,Paul: Let's go! We must convince him to reconsider!
3110,Pent: ...I've no wish to hurt you...
3111,"Canas: Actually, this is quite fascinating. Mark, the Nabata wasteland is a bit of a paradise to magic adepts. Stories tell of the many magical artifacts lost in these sands. I'll keep my eyes open. Of course, I'll be fighting as well."
3112,Rath: Mark… It’s been a long time. No… I have no other business. Command me as you’ve done in the past.
3113,Hawkeye: ......
3114,Eliwood: Who are you?
3115,"Hawkeye: I'm Hawkeye, defender of this desert."
3116,Eliwood: Defender? Of a desert?
3117,Hawkeye: I will drive out the bandits. Guests need not fight.
3118,Eliwood: Please wait! Guests!?
3119,Hector: Ahh…shade. Whew…that’s nice. …Huh? Shade…
3120,Hawkeye: ……
3121,Hector: Hm! Waaa! Who… Who are you?!?
3122,"Hawkeye: I’m Hawkeye, defender of this desert."
3123,Hector: You’re with them? You’ve got some nerve threatening me!
3124,Hawkeye: I will drive the bandits away. Guests need not fight.
3125,Hector: …Huh? He-Hey! What’s going on?
3126,"Pent: Hello there. Beautiful weather, isn't it?"
3127,"Eliwood: Er... Yes, sure."
3128,"Pent: Pardon, I'm in the midst of some confusion. I beg your leave."
3129,Eliwood: Um...????
3130,"Paul: I can't believe we lost, Brother... Aaah... It's a tragedy, Jasmine."
3131,"Jasmine: I got hit, but it feels gooood... These people are too strong, Paul..."
3132,Pent: You really helped me out. Thank you.
3133,Eliwood: We couldn't watch such a lopsided battle. That's all.
3134,Pent: So why have you come to this wasteland?
3135,"Eliwood: Well... We were told to come here and meet a ""living legend."""
3136,"Pent: ""Living legend""? Ha ha ha! I see. That's well said."
3137,Lyn: But do you know what it means?
3138,"Pent: Yes, I suppose I do. Looks like we share a common destination. Hawkeye! You're here, too."
3139,"Hawkeye: Pent, did you find it?"
3140,"Pent: That I did. And as I thought, it's spectacular."
3141,Hawkeye: It's getting dark. Let's go back.
3142,"Pent: Yes, let's make haste. Desert nights are treacherous."
3143,Eliwood: Oh...OK.
3144,"Hector: I don't mind going with you, but how far do we have to walk? No matter how far we go, there's just more sand... What!?"
3145,Lyn: Hector? What is...it... Hect... Kyaa!
3146,Eliwood: Hector? Lyndis? Where did those two... Hnh? What in blazes!? I'm... I'm sinking into the sand!
3147,Eliwood: Oof... A rock wall?... Where am I? ...Where is everyone?
3148,Pent: Hello. You're awake! Are you well?
3149,Eliwood: ...You're...from before...
3150,Pent: Hawkeye's friend.
3151,Hawkeye: ......
3152,Eliwood: Um... Hawkeye? What is this place?
3153,Hawkeye: ...I don't know.
3154,Pent: Eh? You don't know? I would never have imagined a place such as this existed.
3155,Hawkeye: My master never spoke of anything like this.
3156,Nils: Ah! Lord Eliwood! I'm so glad I found you.
3157,Eliwood: Nils! Is everyone all right?
3158,"Nils: Yes, they're nearby. I can't see them, but... I can sense them. So they must be OK."
3159,Eliwood: That's good.
3160,Nils: Do you know where we are? I wonder how we get out of here...
3161,"Eliwood: I'd like to know, too."
3162,Pent: ...Something strange is here. I can feel it in the air.
3163,Nils: Yes! You're right. It's strange. Unsettling!
3164,"Hawkeye: Pent, doesn't that sound like..."
3165,Pent: ...Like a magic seal.
3166,Eliwood: What's that?
3167,Pent: I'm not entirely certain how to explain it. It's...someone whose very presence nullifies all magic.
3168,Eliwood: Why would this person be here? Why now?
3169,Pent: I have no idea. All I know is that we're being watched.
3170,Nils: Uh-oh! Something's happening!
3171,Nils: He... He's called some friends. They are...very powerful.
3172,Pent: He summoned them here? I'm beginning to suspect the magic seal created this place.
3173,"Hawkeye: If we kill him, can we get out of here?"
3174,Pent: Perhaps.
3175,"Eliwood: Then we fight! If they have strength, then we'll match their strength and challenge them! We don't have time for this!!"
3176,"Hawkeye: I will fight, too. Pent, you stay here and guard the others."
3177,Pent: Understood.
3178,Hawkeye: Select those who will go with us. ...And choose carefully.
3179,"Eliwood: All right! Are you ready, everyone? Try not to get separated."
3180,Hawkeye: ...Don't move!
3181,Eliwood: Ah! ...The wall!
3182,Hawkeye: ...He's responsible. He's watching us from somewhere.
3183,Eliwood: ......
3184,"Hawkeye: Mark, is it? I must see you all safely back to my master. If you have need of it, I will lend you my strength."
3185,Pent: The air... It's returned to normal! The magic seal has fled.
3186,"Eliwood: What in the name of all that is decent is that? It has human form, but it's... It's not human!"
3187,Pent: ......
3188,Hawkeye: ......
3189,Ninian: ...That was a creature of heresy. Its existence makes a ruin of nature's most basic laws.
3190,Eliwood: Ninian?
3191,"Ninian: ...Ah, Lord Eliwood. I..."
3192,"Pent: ...In this world, there are many mysterious things that fall beyond our realm of understanding. Come, let us leave this place. A living legend awaits us."
3193,Eliwood: Ah... Yes!
3194,Ninian: ......
3195,Hawkeye: ...Daughter of...
3196,Ninian: ...Hm?
3197,Hawkeye: ......Be strong...
3198,Ninian: ......Ah...
3199,Hawkeye: ...I've brought them.
3200,"Athos: Welcome, children of Roland."
3201,"Hector: We've come from Lycia, old man. Do you understand?"
3202,Lyn: What do you mean?
3203,"Eliwood: I think I know. Thousands of years ago, man and dragon fought on this continent."
3204,"Lyn: Yes, mankind won, and the dragons fled this world."
3205,"Eliwood: That's correct. Man against dragon... That war that we know as the Scouring. And you know of the Eight Legends, the heroes who led man to victory?"
3206,"Lyn: Yes, we've all heard the stories of the Eight Legends. I was raised in Sacae, so I know of Hanon, the horseman."
3207,"Hector: Sacae is where Hanon was born. Our country, Lycia, was founded by the hero Roland."
3208,"Lyn: That's why you called us ""children of Roland,"" right?"
3209,"Athos: That is correct, daughter of Hanon and Roland."
3210,Eliwood: Who are you?
3211,Athos: I am Athos. Many choose simply to call me Archsage.
3212,Eliwood: Athos?! It can't be...
3213,Lyn: Huh? What?!
3214,"Hector: Archsage Athos was one of the Eight Legends. If you really were him, old man... you'd have to be over a thousand years old."
3215,"Athos: The world is full of mysteries. Solve one, and along comes another... Before I knew, I'd grown distant from my fellow man. Hunger... It knows no bounds."
3216,Lyn: A thousand years... That's a long time.
3217,"Eliwood: Yet thanks to such longevity, we're meeting here today."
3218,"Hector: ""Living legend""... Now I see it."
3219,"Athos: You're here because you want to stop Nergal, aren't you?"
3220,Eliwood: Yes. Did you receive word from Marquess Ostia?
3221,"Athos: No... I am aware of most things that occur on the continent. However, knowledge is not enough for me to prevent disaster."
3222,"Lyn: Nils said something similar to that before. ""With my special power, I can sense danger coming, but I can't do anything to stop it."""
3223,Athos: Nils... One of the children of destiny.
3224,"Lyn: He's here with us, but something outside caught his attention."
3225,Athos: ...I'm sure something stopped him...
3226,Eliwood: Hm?
3227,Athos: Let's talk about Nergal. How do we stop him?
3228,"Eliwood: Yes, what can you tell us? What wisdom can you share?"
3229,"Athos: Mm. Your foe is, like me, no longer...altogether human. It will be difficult to slay him through traditional means. He wields a terrible power. His endless strength stems from an ancient, forbidden magic... To defeat him, you will need a suitable response."
3230,Eliwood: Response?
3231,"Athos: ...While he is resting, you must find the power to oppose him."
3232,Eliwood: Tell us what it is! We'll do anything!!
3233,"Athos: It will be harder than you can imagine. Great trials await you. ...As does great despair. You may regret your decision. Will you stay the course, children?"
3234,Eliwood: ...Our will remains fixed.
3235,Athos: This is a road from which you cannot turn back.
3236,Hector: We've known that all along!
3237,"Lyn: We can overcome anything. You'll see. Together, we are strong."
3238,Athos: ...Very well. Let me tell you what you must do.
3239,Athos: Have you understood all that you have heard?
3240,"Eliwood: Yes. We are to seek out the Shrine of Seals in Bern, right?"
3241,Athos: Take Hawkeye with you. Add his skills to your own.
3242,Eliwood: Thank you.
3243,"Athos: ...And you? What will you do, Pent and Louise?"
3244,"Pent: Nergal, a magic user who rivals you, Lord Athos... And the return of the dragons. An intriguing story."
3245,Eliwood: ...
3246,"Pent: Forgive the late introductions. I am Pent, Count Reglay of Etruria. This is Louise, my wife."
3247,Louise: It's nice to meet you.
3248,Eliwood: Count Reglay? You are Count Reglay?
3249,Lyn: Who? Is he someone special?
3250,Hector: Yes. He hails from the most prominent noble house in Etruria. He's known as the Magic General. What has brought you to this place?
3251,Athos: Bern's successor will soon have his coming-of-age ceremony. Pent and Louise are to attend as representatives of Etruria. Pent claimed there was time to search the desert for a magic artifact said to have been lost in the sands here long ago. You arrived shortly after we did. Perhaps something was guiding you.
3252,"Pent: Bowing to the dictates of fate, my wife and I would like to join you if we may."
3253,"Lyn: Well, of course. That's fine, right, Eliwood? Will you send word of your mission to your countrymen?"
3254,"Pent: There's no reason to, and if we did, who would believe us? Besides, it's not unusual for us to remain absent for long periods. I doubt anyone will be surprised by our absence. Right, my dear?"
3255,"Louise: Tee hee. You're right, my love."
3256,Eliwood: Not unlike a certain young noble we've heard of...
3257,Hector: That's great! Thanks a lot!
3258,"Eliwood: In any event, we welcome you both with all our hearts."
3259,Pent: Thank you.
3260,Athos: ...There's not much time. I'll send you to Lycia. Hawkeye! Gather everyone here in the plaza.
3261,"Athos: You are Tactician, correct? Fate blows a strange wind in your direction. Much rides on your shoulders and in your abilities. I want you to take this. It enhances natural abilities, skills with which one was born. Give this to whomever you feel will benefit the most. Do not waste its power holding on to it. Use it."
3262,Hawkeye: Everyone is here.
3263,"Athos: Thank you. Eliwood, your territory is the closest to Bern, is it not?"
3264,Eliwood: Yes. The border lies in the mountains.
3265,"Athos: Very good. Now please envision a nice, wide place in Pherae... Next, think of the name of a person you might meet there."
3266,Eliwood: As you say. ... ...
3267,"Athos: Now, children of Roland, it is time to say farewell. You must reach the Shrine of Seals. There, your destinies' doors will open wide before you."
3268,"Eleanora: My beloved... I cannot believe you are gone. Every time I close my eyes, I see you at my side. Your memory haunts me, and I am filled with sorrow. ...Elbert... If by some chance you can hear my prayer... Please look after our son."
3269,???: Mother...
3270,Eleanora: What!? Eliwood? Where--Where are you?
3271,Eliwood: Mother! I'm home! I've returned!
3272,"Eleanora: Ah!! Eliwood! Is it really you? Oh, how did you... You startled me so!"
3273,"Eliwood: Forgive me, Mother. The Archsage sent us."
3274,"Eleanora: You look so tired. ...Have you lost weight? Oh, come closer and let me see your face."
3275,"Eliwood: ...Mother, about Father..."
3276,"Eleanora: I heard his last moments were glorious. Though he's gone, he will ever be my life's joy."
3277,Eliwood: I know.
3278,Eleanora: Come... Let us make everyone comfortable. You all look in need of a rest.
3279,"Eliwood: I'm sorry, Mother. We must hurry onward..."
3280,Eleanora: I know that! But for one night... here in the castle... Eliwood... just for tonight.
3281,Eliwood: Mother...
3282,Hector: One night's not going to hurt us. Who knows when we'll be back this way?
3283,"Lyn: Yes, let's do it. I am so exhausted."
3284,"Eliwood: Hector, Lyn... Thank you."
3285,"Eliwood: Hello, Tactician. So you're still awake. Tactician, do you know Bern well? No, nor do I... Nothing more than I've heard at court. I'm sure that, with all of your travels, you know more than I. By the way, Tactician, where were you born? Before you met Lyndis in Sacae, where were you? If it's difficult to speak about, you needn't worry. It's just that we've been together for so long, and I really know almost nothing about you. If you don't mind, won't you tell me about yourself? I would like to learn more about you and your life."
3286,"Heeding the archsage Athos's advice, Eliwood sets out for Bern. Bern: the greatest military force on the continent. The Lycian League has always enjoyed close relations with the kingdom of Bern. Recently, however, King Desmond has begun to flaunt his military strength. Lycian nobles can no longer move freely within Bern's borders. Eliwood and his group enter the country in the guise of simple travelers.

My name is Wallace! The boldest knight in all Caelin (wherever it is)! If you're not afraid to die, show yourselves!!! Bwah ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
"
3291,"     the ceremony. Without the Emblem, the ceremony must be canceled.
"
3292,Eliwood: We're in Bern now. I wonder what's happened? The village seems so busy.
3293,Lyn: I spoke to some villagers on the way here. They said Prince Zephiel's coming-of-age ceremony is in ten days. There's no helping all the excitement.
3294,Hector: They've no idea what's happening. Carefree fools.
3295,"Eliwood: ......Tell me, Hawkeye, do you know the location of the Shrine of Seals?"
3296,Hawkeye: I've heard it's north of Bern. But the location of the shrine itself is secret. I doubt if anyone outside the royal family knows how to reach it.
3297,"Lyn: So, if we want to reach the shrine, we'll have to contact the royal family, is that it?"
3298,Hector: Without revealing our identities or our motives? There's got to be another way to find where it is.
3299,Pent: ...I can provide you with its general location.
3300,Eliwood: Lord Pent?
3301,"Pent: I'm privy to the highest secrets of military information in Etruria. When we learned of the shrine's existence, we investigated. However, none of our operatives returned. Bern's defenses are formidable."
3302,"Hector: So, even if we reach the shrine, we're as like as not to be captured?"
3303,"Pent: Most likely. And if your identities are discovered, Bern will see it as an excuse to invade Lycia."
3304,"Eliwood: That, above all else, must be avoided."
3305,Pent: That's where I come in.
3306,Eliwood: What do you mean?
3307,"Pent: Duty demands that I attend the post-ceremony festivities. However, I will greet the queen privately before the ceremony."
3308,Eliwood: Privately? You can do that?
3309,"Louise: Queen Hellene was born in Etruria. She and I are related, albeit a distant relation."
3310,"Pent: When we meet, I will discreetly ask about the Shrine of Seals. Most like, she'll not say much, but anything will help, will it not? Rest assured, even if I fail, I will not reveal your presence."
3311,Eliwood: Lord Pent! That's--
3312,"Pent: If we do not return by tomorrow, return to Lycia and come up with a new plan. Understood?"
3313,"Eliwood: ...If you fail, what will become of you?"
3314,Pent: Everything will work out. It wouldn't be a bad life. Abandoning my position... Living on the run with Louise...
3315,"Louise: If I'm with you, my Lord Pent, I care not where we go."
3316,Hector: I pray for your success.
3317,"Pent: Please do! Let us proceed, Louise."
3318,Lyn: Come back safely! We'll be waiting for you!!
3319,"Hawkeye: ...Pent, hold on."
3320,"Pent: What is it, Hawkeye?"
3321,Hawkeye: I was holding this for the master.
3322,Pent: It's a... Heaven seal!
3323,Hawkeye: Mm...There are only three in existence.
3324,Pent: What is Archsage Athos's plan?
3325,Hawkeye: I'm to give it to them when the time is right.
3326,Pent: ...I see.
3327,Hawkeye: I... I might not know the right time when it comes. I want you to take care of it.
3328,"Pent: Thank you, but what if we do not return?"
3329,Hawkeye: You will. You and Louise... .......without fail.
3330,Pent: ...I understand.
3331,"Louise: Lord Hawkeye, we... we will most certainly return."
3332,"Linus: Well, if it isn't Nino."
3333,Nino: Yeah! Lloyd! Linus! What is it? Are you working?
3334,Lloyd: I suppose we are.
3335,Linus: How about you? Where are you off to in such a hurry?
3336,"Nino: I have a job to do, too! I'm carrying messages for Mother, so I have to do my best! See you! Let's do something when your job is finished."
3337,Lloyd: She's a good lass.
3338,Linus: Yes. Hard to believe she's that woman's child.
3339,Eliwood: This waiting is hard. There must be something we can do.
3340,"Hector: I know what you mean, but we have to lay low..."
3341,Legault: Why don't we try and gather some information on the Black Fang?
3342,Lyn: Hm? Information?
3343,"Legault: Yes. Black Fang's headquarters are here in Bern. The location was never disclosed to me, though. The Black Fang is so much different than it once was. Any information we could gain would be beneficial."
3344,"Eliwood: That's a good idea. Thanks, Legault."
3345,Legault: Think nothing of it.
3346,"Eliwood: What do you think, Tactician? ...You're right. Any information we find would be a starting place. Then it's settled. Let's get started."
3347,Let's split up and go. Try to blend in.
3348,Hector: We'd better be careful.
3349,"Lyn: Especially you, Hector."
3350,Hector: What!?
3351,Eliwood: Those two... I can't tell if they're friends or not.
3352,Ninian: Tee hee...
3353,"Eliwood: Is something funny, Ninian?"
3354,"Ninian: It's just... Listen to you grumble, Lord Eliwood! You sound like you're their chaperon!"
3355,Eliwood: Really? Is that what it sounds like to you?
3356,Ninian: Uh-huh.
3357,Eliwood: That's great...
3358,Ninian: Ha ha ha.
3359,Eliwood: ...I like it when you laugh.
3360,Ninian: Excuse me?
3361,"Eliwood: Oh, nothing. Come on! Let's go!"
3362,Lloyd: ...Can it really be them? I thought they were in Nabata!
3363,"Linus: What does it matter where they've been? We found them, so let's take care of them."
3364,Lloyd: I guess you're right... Yet the timing's not right. Attacking them while they're in town is against our creed. ...Shall we tell Father and await his orders?
3365,"Lloyd: Linus, I'll go and tell Father. You stay here and watch them."
3366,Linus: Why don't you and I finish them now?
3367,Lloyd: We can't! You have to be patient. All you need to do is watch where they go. Understand?
3368,Linus: Uh-huh.
3369,"Linus: ......Even so, I can't ignore game when it's nibbling on my line. Hey! Igor!"
3370,"Igor: What is it, Linus?"
3371,Linus: We're going hunting! We'll taunt them and pull them to the center of the town.
3372,"Igor: Hold on a minute. You're not really going to ignore Lloyd's orders, are you?"
3373,"Linus: ...He doesn't want the villagers harmed. That's what he said, right? So we make sure they're not."
3374,"Igor: I understand, but..."
3375,"Linus: Come on, Igor! We want to show my brother we can do this, right? I'm counting on you!"
3376,"Igor: ...Grrr! You just never, ever listen to anyone!"
3377,Igor: You are Eliwood?
3378,"Eliwood: Who--Ah, you're Black Fang?"
3379,"Igor: That's right. You have the honor of dying at the hands of the Four Fangs. Our commander is Linus, the Mad Dog."
3380,Hector: Eliwood! Is that the enemy?
3381,Eliwood: Yes. Let's meet his challenge!
3382,Igor: ...Come. You'll get your throats ripped out...
3383,"Heath: Bern... ...Hm? Oh, Mark. I have few fond memories of my homeland. I'm a deserter. Yet...I can't say I'm not a little glad to be here. I hope that, someday soon, I can clear my name and return home."
3384,"Legault: ...... Who? Oh, it's you, is it, Mark? You caught me unawares and looking stupid. It's just that I AM a former Black Fang member. And I was a bit wrapped up in some silly emotions. Nothing for you to worry about. Direct me as you will."
3385,"Nino: Let's see... I'm sure this is the place, but... I guess he's not here yet. ... ... Hmm! Beautiful weather. It's perfect for taking on evildoers! Yet here I am again, running errands... I wish I were more worthy, so that I could help out in battle."
3386,"Nino: Waah! Don't... Don't scare me like that, Jaffar. What's wrong? You're never late for anything."
3387,Jaffar: ...My last job took longer than expected.
3388,Nino: What? There are things that can slow you down? I would never have expected that.
3389,Jaffar: ...If you've my next mission...let me hear it.
3390,"Nino: Oh, right. Mother gave this to me... Huh? Oh! Wha-What happened? You're covered in blood!"
3391,Jaffar: ...It's a scratch. Pay it no heed...
3392,Nino: Scratches don't bleed like that! Let me see.
3393,Jaffar: Forget it. Next target...hurry... .......
3394,"Nino: Jaffar! Come on, wake... Wake up! What should I do?"
3395,"Nino: Er... Is there something I can help you with? I have an injured man here. Please keep your voice down! No, I don't know anything about the Black Fang! Leave, please! You'll upset my patient!"
3396,"Woman: Tell me, traveler, have you heard of the Four Fangs? The folk of Bern know all about them. They're the four strongest members of the righteous Black Fang. The one they call the Mad Dog is a great man. When I was being attacked by bandits, he rescued me. It was night, so I really couldn't see his face, but... I've heard some troubling rumors about the Black Fang lately, though. I wonder what's going on."
3397,"Old Woman: Long ago...the lord who ruled this area was an awful man. Every night he would hold an extravagant feast below the castle. Meanwhile, we villagers slowly starved to death. One day, though, it ended. The lord was dead. The Black Fang had given him a death sentence. To us, the Black Fang were heroes. It matters not what others said. That's what makes it so hard... Why did they have to change? Helping you...means that I'm betraying the Black Fang. And yet...I want you to have this."
3398,???: ...Stop right there.
3399,Unit: Who?
3400,"???: No need for alarm. For reasons of my own, I wear the garb of the Black Fang, but I'm a loyal citizen of Lycia, and I am not your enemy."
3401,Unit: ......
3402,"???: A woman now leads the Black Fang around by the nose. When at last you confront her, use this staff. This woman is the ringleader you seek. Her name is Sonia. Do not forget. Sonia."
3403,"Old Man: Long ago, I used to work in Bern's royal palace. I was Prince Zephiel's teacher of history. The prince is a wise lad. He's the royal family's first prodigy. Yet King Desmond ignores the boy's talents, and they wither. Here...I'd like you to take this. This is an Earth seal. This one item contains the powers of many: Knight crest, Guide ring, Hero crest, Elysian whip... I am unsure why I would entrust this treasure to a complete stranger. I cannot explain it, but I have a feeling. For some reason, I believe you will aid the prince... Strange... Go on! Humor an old man and take it."
3404,"Soldier: I will repeat it as often as necessary, Lord Murdock! If we let the king's tyranny continue, Bern will--"
3405,Murdock: Hold your tongue.
3406,Soldier: But--
3407,Murdock: Be still.
3408,Murdock: Is someone there?
3409,Unit: Oh!
3410,Dart: Wait a minute. I've seen you before.
3411,Geitz: What? Do you think you can just come up and start--
3412,"Dart: Ah, I know! You're that guy who worked for Belger...Geitz!"
3413,Geitz: Dart!? Is that you? What are you doing here?
3414,Dart: I like to raise some trouble on land every now and then. How about you? What are you doing? Working for your father?
3415,"Geitz: Don't mention the old man!! As far as I'm concerned, I'm no part of that family anymore!"
3416,"Dart: Well then, what are you doing here?"
3417,"Geitz: Nothing... I was wandering about when this battle erupted. ...Say, Dart, do you think I could join up with you?"
3418,Dart: Huh? Of all the stupid...
3419,"Geitz: You're ""raising trouble,"" right? So, let me in on the action."
3420,"Dart: It's fine with me. We're up against a pretty touch bunch, though."
3421,Geitz: I've nothing else to do. I'll fight 'til I get bored!
3422,Dart: Let's go then.
3423,Geitz: Yeah!
3424,"Linus: Hey! You're Eliwood, right?"
3425,Eliwood: ...Are you the leader of this group?
3426,Linus: I am.
3427,"Eliwood: I've a question for you... I heard that the Black Fang possessed strong convictions. If so, then why do you follow a man like Nergal?"
3428,"Linus: ...Nergal? Oh, that eerie man Sonia introduced my father to. This has nothing to do with him. I merely complete the missions given me!"
3429,Eliwood: And you never question the justness of your missions?
3430,Linus: Question? What's to question? Neither my father nor my brother makes mistakes!
3431,"Eliwood: Yet, the..."
3432,"Linus: Will you stop yammering! I don't need my brother to finish you off. I will crush you myself, in the name of the Fang!"
3433,Eliwood: Ah!!
3434,Hector: Hey! You the leader of this pack of curs?
3435,"Linus: I am Linus Reed! Son of Brendan Reed, head of the Black Fang! Evildoers! Prepare to receive the Fang's justice!"
3436,Hector: Evildoers? You've no room to speak! You're a bunch of murderers serving Nergal's every whim!
3437,"Linus: Are you so base that you bandy insults with your foe? Or are you frightened, knowing you face your doom? We are the Black Fang! You do not insult my family so!"
3438,Linus: Urrg...rr......
3439,Eliwood: ...Are you well?
3440,Linus: ......I lost. My brother
3441,Eliwood: ......
3442,Linus: But... I will not die quite so easily!
3443,Eliwood: What!?
3444,Linus: You'll go with me!!
3445,Hector: Eliwood!
3446,Eliwood: ...Do as you must.
3447,Linus: Huh!? ...What did you...
3448,Eliwood: ...I noticed something during the battle. You did your best to keep the villagers clear of the fighting.
3449,"Linus: Of course. They've nothing to do with this. You are our target, not them."
3450,Eliwood: You are not evil. The Black Fang fights with honor. So why is it that we are enemies?
3451,Linus: It's your fault! You're evil... ......Bah!
3452,Eliwood: Huh!?
3453,"Linus: None of this makes sense! Sonia told Father that you're a band of criminals. Father agreed and I obeyed, but..."
3454,Eliwood: Sonia? Isn't that...?
3455,Linus: ...I'm going to withdraw for the moment. I'll be back when this is all straightened out.
3456,Hector: That was close.
3457,Eliwood: Forgive me. I wanted to speak with him at least once.
3458,"Lyn: Don't worry. It's fine. After all, we learned a little something about our opponent."
3459,"Eliwood: The Black Fang seems to have some honor after all. Perhaps they really are just being used by Nergal. We should talk to their leader, Brendan Reed."
3460,Lyn: Perhaps we can resolve this without any more fighting.
3461,Hector: I don't like it sounds like a terrible plan.
3462,Eliwood: Hector?
3463,Hector: Let's get back to camp. We might have some word from Pent and the others.
3464,Lyn: I wonder what that was all about.
3465,Eliwood:...
3466,Linus: ...I've got to talk with my brother... ...I'm not sure it's wise to trust that woman... !!
3467,Linus: ...Uhh...how...
3468,Limstella: ......
3469,Linus: You...I never felt you... .......nothing......
3470,Limstella: ...Mad Dog Linus. Such wonderful quintessence.
3471,Linus: ......Curse...s... ...I've...blu...blundered... Brother...I'm sorry... ... ...
3472,Jaffar: ......
3473,Nino: Are you awake? Thank goodness...
3474,Jaffar: You... I know you...
3475,"Nino: Uh-huh. We've met many times. I don't think I told you my name, though. I'm Nino! Sonia's daughter."
3476,Jaffar: What are you doing?
3477,Nino: Huh?
3478,"Jaffar: Have you forgotten the law of the Fang? ""Sacrifice the wounded to salvage the strong."""
3479,Nino: That's not...
3480,"Jaffar: I was unconscious and alone outside of our safe halls. You should have obeyed the law... Killed me, and then fled. Yet you didn't. Why?"
3481,Nino: Bu-But... Letting a comrade die? I...couldn't do that.
3482,Jaffar: Don't be a fool!
3483,Nino: Sniff...
3484,Jaffar: ...Tsk...
3485,Nino: Don't move! Here! Lean on me!
3486,Jaffar: ...Don't...touch...
3487,"Nino: Please, don't move. So much blood... You're bleeding again. What do I do? It won't stop."
3488,Jaffar: ......
3489,Nino: PLease...don't die. You mustn't die.
3490,"Lloyd: ...... Linus... You fool, after all I told you... ...... ...Wait for me. I'll be joining you soon enough. And I'll bring you their corpses as a gift."
3491,"Soldier: Your Royal Highness, His Majesty the king has arrived."
3492,Desmond: Where's Zephiel?
3493,Hellene: Your Majesty... 'Tis a pleasure to see you. What a glorious day that sees you grace us with your
3494,Desmond: ...Enough. Call the boy!
3495,Hellene: Your son is practicing his falconry.
3496,"Desmond: You knew I was coming, and yet you sent him away. Hmph... As crafty as ever, woman. Very well, you will have to do. It's ten days until the boy's coming-of-age ceremony. I would speak of it."
3497,"Hellene: At last... Once the ceremony ends, our son, so long lingering in the shadows, will be received by all as the legitimate heir to your throne. Do you know how he has longed for this day?"
3498,"Desmond: Cease your complaints. You and Zephiel, queen and heir of Bern, have never wanted for anything."
3499,"Hellene: We are here in this manse, while you live in the palace with... that woman. You must be so disappointed that she bore you not a prince but a princess."
3500,Desmond: Hellene! You go too far!!
3501,"Hellene: My child, who through me carries the noble blood of Etruria in his veins, will in ten days be named as the right-born heir to the throne. Ha ha ha! No matter how you may dote on her, your illegitimate daughter, Guinivere, is destined to be nothing more than a baseborn shadow... It is my son who shall reign in Bern! My son, Zephiel! Ha ha ha ha ha! How it gives me such pleasure to say those words!"
3502,"Desmond: Have you said your mind? Well, I have something for you to hear as well."
3503,Hellene: What could it be?
3504,"Desmond: Last night, from the palace, the Fire Emblem was stolen away by some villain."
3505,"Hellene: It can't be! ...Ha ha ha. You are so wicked, Your Majesty. Pray tell, who would believe such a tale? The Fire Emblem is Bern's greatest national treasure. No gem in existence is its equal. Stealing such a heavily guarded object is impossible, is it not?"
3506,"Desmond: Unfortunately, I speak true."
3507,Hellene: No...
3508,"Desmond: You know of the importance of the Fire Emblem. It's the symbol of the heir, the heart of the ceremony. Without the Emblem, the ceremony must be canceled."
3509,"Hellene: No!! Thi-This was your doing, wasn't it? How can you despise Zephiel so? He is of your blood. He is your beloved son, is he not?"
3510,"Desmond: I have heard that Zephiel is... a gifted student, a stunning fighter, excelling in all he tries. And I've also heard that he is much loved by the people."
3511,Hellene: Yes! It is true. All of it! He is a worthy son.
3512,Desmond: I...excelled at neither books nor blades.
3513,Hellene: What do you--
3514,Desmond: I cannot say that I command the love of my subjects... Zephiel and I are opposites in every way. It is hard to believe that he is my son.
3515,"Hellene: Zephiel is Your Majesty's child! Your Grace, you know this is truth!"
3516,"Desmond: Mine or not, without the ceremony... He will not be named heir. Mark my words, and prepare yourself, woman."
3517,Hellene: Your Majesty! King Desmond!! Please... Please wait! He is your heir! Your son! Please... What am I to do? Zephiel...
3518,"Servant: I beg your pardon, Your Hgihness. You have a visitor..."
3519,Hellene: I will see no one. Send him home.
3520,"Servant: Your Highness, I..."
3521,???: It's all right. You may go. I will take care of this.
3522,"Servant: Yes, my lady."
3523,Hellene: Who?
3524,"Louise: Lady Hellene, it's been far too long. It is I, Louise."
3525,Hellene: Louise!? Is it truly you? Ah... Louise...
3526,Louise: What is it? Your eyes are so red. It's a shame to see such beauty marred by tears.
3527,Hellene: There is something... I...
3528,"Louise: If it please you, I would hear your troubles. My husband is here with me. Perhaps he will be able to lend you his aid."
3529,Hellene: Lord Pent is also here? I see... ...... ...To be honest...
3530,Eliwood: Lord Pent! Lady Louise!!
3531,Pent: Sorry to have kept you waiting.
3532,Eliwood: ...How did everything go?
3533,"Pent: ...I can't say it was a complete failure, yet..."
3534,Lyn: What do you mean?
3535,Louise: We've a task to perform.
3536,Hector: What do you mean?
3537,Pent: Queen Hellene is looking for something. If we find it for her...
3538,"Eliwood: She will listen to our request, is that it?"
3539,Pent: We have until the morning of the tenth day from today. ...What will you do? The decision is yours.
3540,Eliwood: ...We'll do it. It is most certainly a test we were destined to take.
3541,"Eliwood: We move to Bern from here in an instant. ...Incredible. Even in a remote village like this, they've heard announcements for the prince's coming-of-age ceremony."
3542,"Lyn: Well, Prince Zephiel's ceremony is only ten days away. There's no helping all the excitement."
3543,Hector: They've no idea what's happening... Carefree fools.
3544,"Eliwood: ......Tell me, Hawkeye, do you know the location of the Shrine of Seals?"
3545,Hawkeye: I've heard it's north of Bern. But the location of the shrine itself is secret. I doubt if anyone outside the royal family knows how to reach it.
3546,"Lyn: So, if we want to reach the shrine, we'll have to contact the royal family, is that it?"
3547,Hector: Without revealing our identities or our motives? There's got to be another way to find where it is.
3548,Pent: ...I can provide you with its general location.
3549,Eliwood: Lord Pent?
3550,"Pent: I'm privy to the highest secrets of military information in Etruria. When we learned of the shrine's existence, we investigated. However, none of our operatives returned. Bern's defenses are formidable."
3551,"Hector: So, even if we reach the shrine, we're as like as not to be captured?"
3552,"Pent: Most likely. And if your identities are discovered, Bern will see it as an excuse to invade Lycia."
3553,"Eliwood: That, above all else, must be avoided."
3554,Pent: That's where I come in.
3555,Eliwood: What do you mean?
3556,"Pent: Duty demands that I attend the post-ceremony festivities. However, I will greet the queen privately before the ceremony."
3557,Eliwood: Privately? You can do that?
3558,"Louise: Queen Hellene was born in Etruria. She and I are related, albeit a distant relation."
3559,"Pent: When we meet, I will discreetly ask about the Shrine of Seals. Most like, she'll not say much, but anything will help, will it not? Rest assured, even if I fail, I will not reveal your presence."
3560,Eliwood: Lord Pent! That's--
3561,"Pent: If we do not return by tomorrow, return to Lycia and come up with a new plan. Understood?"
3562,"Eliwood: ...If you fail, what will become of you?"
3563,Pent: Everything will work out. It wouldn't be a bad life. Abandoning my position... Living on the run with Louise...
3564,"Louise: If I'm with you, my Lord Pent, I care not where we go."
3565,Hector: I pray for your success.
3566,"Pent: Please do! Let us proceed, Louise."
3567,Lyn: Come back safely! We'll be waiting for you!!
3568,"Hawkeye: ...Pent, hold on."
3569,"Pent: What is it, Hawkeye?"
3570,Hawkeye: I was holding this for the master.
3571,Pent: It's a... Heaven seal!
3572,Hawkeye: Mm...There are only three in existence.
3573,Pent: What is Archsage Athos's plan?
3574,Hawkeye: I'm to give it to them when the time is right.
3575,Pent: ...I see.
3576,Hawkeye: I... I might not know the right time when it comes. I want you to take care of it.
3577,"Pent: Thank you, but what if we do not return?"
3578,Hawkeye: You will. You and Louise... .......without fail.
3579,Pent: ...I understand.
3580,"Louise: Lord Hawkeye, we... we will most certainly return."
3581,"Linus: Well, if it isn't Nino."
3582,Nino: Yeah! Lloyd! Linus! What is it? Are you working?
3583,Lloyd: I suppose we are.
3584,Linus: How about you? Where are you off to in such a hurry?
3585,"Nino: I have a job to do, too! I'm carrying messages for Mother, so I have to do my best! See you! Let's do something when your job is finished."
3586,Lloyd: She's a good lass.
3587,Linus: Yes. Hard to believe she's that woman's child.
3588,Eliwood: This waiting is hard. There must be something we can do.
3589,"Hector: I know what you mean, but we have to lay low..."
3590,Legault: Why don't we try and gather some information on the Black Fang?
3591,Lyn: Hm? Information?
3592,"Legault: Yes. Black Fang's headquarters are here in Bern. The location was never disclosed to me, though. The Black Fang is so much different than it once was. Any information we could gain would be beneficial."
3593,"Eliwood: That's a good idea. Thanks, Legault."
3594,Legault: Think nothing of it.
3595,"Eliwood: What do you think, Tactician? ...You're right. Any information we find would be a starting place. Then it's settled. Let's get started."
3596,Let's split up and go. Try to blend in.
3597,Hector: We'd better be careful.
3598,"Lyn: Especially you, Hector."
3599,Hector: What!?
3600,Eliwood: Those two... I can't tell if they're friends or not.
3601,Ninian: Tee hee...
3602,"Eliwood: Is something funny, Ninian?"
3603,"Ninian: It's just... Listen to you grumble, Lord Eliwood! You sound like you're their chaperon!"
3604,Eliwood: Really? Is that what it sounds like to you?
3605,Ninian: Uh-huh.
3606,Eliwood: That's great...
3607,Ninian: Ha ha ha.
3608,Eliwood: ...I like it when you laugh.
3609,Ninian: Excuse me?
3610,"Eliwood: Oh, nothing. Come on! Let's go!"
3611,Lloyd: ...Can it really be them? I thought they were in Nabata!
3612,"Linus: What does it matter where they've been? We found them, so let's take care of them."
3613,"Lloyd: I guess you're right... Linus, go tell father what's happening."
3614,Linus: Why?! They're right in front of us! You and I could finish this now.
3615,"Lloyd: Moron. It's a precaution. The Fangs cannot afford mistakes. Don't worry I have underlings aplenty. I'll taunt the foe and draw them to the fortress in the north. I doubt I'll lose, but... They've survived this long, so they must be tough. I might run into trouble. Deliver your report, then get back here with reinforcements."
3616,"Linus: You can't be serious. They don't look like they can last long against you, the White Wolf."
3617,"Lloyd: Just get moving, Linus."
3618,"Linus: ...Understood. I'll be back soon, though, so leave some for me!"
3619,Black Fang: You must Eliwood...
3620,Eliwood: Ah!  Black Fang!?
3621,"Black Fang: That's right. You have the honor of dying at the hands of the Four Fangs. Our commander is Lloyd, the White Wolf."
3622,Hector: Eliwood! Is that the enemy?
3623,"Eliwood: Counterattack! To arms, everyone!"
3624,Black Fang: ...Come. You'll get your throats ripped out...
3625,"Heath: Bern... ...Hm? Oh, Mark. I have few fond memories of my homeland. I'm a deserter. Yet...I can't say I'm not a little glad to be here. I hope that, someday soon, I can clear my name and return home."
3626,"Legault: ...... Who? Oh, it's you, is it, Mark? You caught me unawares and looking stupid. It's just that I AM a former Black Fang member. And I was a bit wrapped up in some silly emotions. Nothing for you to worry about. Direct me as you will."
3627,"Nino: Let's see... I'm sure this is the place, but... I guess he's not here yet. ... ... Hmm! Fog's thick today. It's perfect for taking on evildoers! Yet here I am again, running errands... I wish I were more worthy, so that I could help out in battle."
3628,"Nino: Waah! Don't... Don't scare me like that, Jaffar. What's wrong? You're never late for anything."
3629,Jaffar: ...My last job took longer than expected.
3630,Nino: What? There are things that can slow you down? I would never have expected that.
3631,Jaffar: ...If you've my next mission...let me hear it.
3632,"Nino: Oh, right. Mother gave this to me... Huh? Oh! Wha-What happened? You're covered in blood!"
3633,Jaffar: ...It's a scratch. Pay it no heed...
3634,Nino: Scratches don't bleed like that! Let me see.
3635,Jaffar: Forget it. Next target...hurry... .......
3636,"Nino: Jaffar! Come on, wake... Wake up! What should I do?"
3637,"Nino: Er... Is there something I can help you with? I have an injured man here. Please keep your voice down! No, I don't know anything about the Black Fang! Leave, please! You'll upset my patient!"
3638,"Woman: Tell me, traveler, have you heard of the Four Fangs? The folk of Bern know all about them. They're the four strongest members of the righteous Black Fang. I'm quite fond of the White Wolf. Of course, I've never seen him, but... I'm sure he's as handsome as can be. I've heard some troubling rumors about the Black Fang lately, though. I wonder what's going on."
3639,"Old Man: Long ago, I used to work in Bern's royal palace. I was Prince Zephiel's teacher of history. The prince is a wise lad. He's the royal family's first prodigy. Yet King Desmond ignores the boy's talents, and they wither. Here...I'd like you to take this. This is an Earth seal. This one item contains the powers of many: Knight crest, Guide ring, Hero crest, Elysian whip... I am unsure why I would entrust this treasure to a complete stranger. I cannot explain it, but I have a feeling. For some reason, I believe you will aid the prince... Strange... Go on! Humor an old man and take it."
3640,Eliwood: ...Are you the leader of this group?
3641,Lloyd: Yes.
3642,"Eliwood: I heard that the Black Fang possessed strong convictions. If so, then why do you follow a man like Nergal?"
3643,Lloyd: This has nothing to do with Nergal or Sonia. We simply complete the missions given us.
3644,Eliwood: And you never question the justness of your missions?
3645,Lloyd: Who are we to pass judgment on the commands given us? We are the jaw that bites. We act without question.
3646,Eliwood: But...
3647,"Lloyd: Granted, you don't seem like a bad sort. However, the Fang's judgment cannot be undone. It is time for you to die."
3648,Eliwood: Ah!!
3649,Hector: ...And you would be the leader of this pack of curs?
3650,Lloyd: Aye. That I am.
3651,Hector: I've no mercy for Nergal's hounds of the hunt! Stand and prepare to be beaten.
3652,"Lloyd: You... You wish to challenge me with that axe of yours? ...You're amusing, I'll grant you that. I'm sure you'd have Linus laughing if he were here. Be warned, you would do well not to take me lightly."
3653,Lloyd: Urgh...
3654,Eliwood: ...Are you well?
3655,Lloyd: ......I'm beaten. You are strong. Stronger than I'd realized
3656,Eliwood: ......
3657,"Lloyd: You're foolish as well. To waste sentiment on me, your enemy..."
3658,Eliwood: Ah!
3659,Lloyd: This is what happens!
3660,Hector: Eliwood!
3661,Eliwood: ...
3662,"Lloyd: Peace. I've no plans on fleeing with a hostage. After I deal with you, I'll let the rest of them go."
3663,Eliwood: Uhai said the same thing.
3664,Lloyd: What?
3665,Eliwood: We battled your comrade Uhai on the Dread Isle... He told us he'd do nothing so cowardly as take a hostage. He fought with honor. You Black Fang are not evil by nature. So why is it that we fight?
3666,Lloyd: Uhai... You spoke with him?
3667,"Eliwood: Yes. With. his dying breath, he told us the way to the Dragon's Gate."
3668,Lloyd: I see...
3669,Eliwood: Ah!
3670,"Lloyd: Go. Don't worry. I too, have my honor. I will not attack again."
3671,Eliwood: Will you join our cause?
3672,"Lloyd: No... However, something is amiss. You have been granted a brief reprieve until I have my answers."
3673,"Eliwood: ...Tell us, what is your name?"
3674,Lloyd: I'll tell you next time we meet. Be seeing you. Watch out for the woman named Sonia.
3675,Hector: That was close.
3676,Eliwood: Forgive me. I wanted to speak with him at least once.
3677,"Lyn: Don't worry. It's fine. After all, we learned a little something about our opponent."
3678,"Eliwood: The Black Fang seems to have some honor after all. Perhaps they really are just being used by Nergal. We should talk to their leader, Brendan Reed."
3679,Lyn: Perhaps we can resolve this without any more fighting.
3680,Hector: I don't like it sounds like a terrible plan.
3681,Eliwood: Hector?
3682,Hector: Let's get back to camp. We might have some word from Pent and the others.
3683,Lyn: I wonder what that was all about.
3684,Eliwood:...
3685,Lloyd: ...As I suspected. They are not the gang of thugs Sonia made them out to be....How do I unmask that woman for what she truly is? Ah!!
3686,Lloyd: ...Uwaa......
3687,Limstella: ......
3688,Lloyd: Impossible... Not a sound... .......nothing......
3689,"Limstella: Lloyd, the White Wolf. Such strong quintessence."
3690,Lloyd: ......Li...Linus...Tell......Father...
3691,Jaffar: ......
3692,Nino: Are you awake? Thank goodness...
3693,Jaffar: You... I know you...
3694,"Nino: Uh-huh. We've met many times. I don't think I told you my name, though. I'm Nino! Sonia's daughter."
3695,Jaffar: What are you doing?
3696,Nino: Huh?
3697,"Jaffar: Have you forgotten the law of the Fang? ""Sacrifice the wounded to salvage the strong."""
3698,Nino: That's not...
3699,"Jaffar: I was unconscious and alone outside of our safe halls. You should have obeyed the law... Killed me, and then fled. Yet you didn't. Why?"
3700,Nino: Bu-But... Letting a comrade die? I...couldn't do that.
3701,Jaffar: Don't be a fool!
3702,Nino: Sniff...
3703,Jaffar: ...Tsk...
3704,Nino: Don't move! Here! Lean on me!
3705,Jaffar: ...Don't...touch...
3706,"Nino: Please, don't move. So much blood... You're bleeding again. What do I do? It won't stop."
3707,Jaffar: ......
3708,Nino: PLease...don't die. You mustn't die.
3709,Linus: Lloyd... Brother? Lloyd!! This...is unforgivable! I will kill them all!! Not a one will survive!!!
3710,"Soldier: Your Royal Highness, His Majesty the king has arrived."
3711,Desmond: Where's Zephiel?
3712,Hellene: Your Majesty... 'Tis a pleasure to see you. What a glorious day that sees you grace us with your presence.
3713,Desmond: ...Enough. Call the boy!
3714,Hellene: Your son is practicing his falconry.
3715,"Desmond: You knew I was coming, and yet you sent him away. Hmph... As crafty as ever, woman. Very well, you will have to do. It's ten days until the boy's coming-of-age ceremony. I would speak of it."
3716,"Hellene: At last... Once the ceremony ends, our son, so long lingering in the shadows, will be received by all as the legitimate heir to your throne. Do you know how he has longed for this day?"
3717,"Desmond: Cease your complaints. You and Zephiel, queen and heir of Bern, have never wanted for anything."
3718,"Hellene: We are here in this manse, while you live in the palace with... that woman. You must be so disappointed that she bore you not a prince but a princess."
3719,Desmond: Hellene! You go too far!!
3720,"Hellene: My child, who through me carries the noble blood of Etruria in his veins, will in ten days be named as the right-born heir to the throne. Ha ha ha! No matter how you may dote on her, your illegitimate daughter, Guinivere, is destined to be nothing more than a baseborn shadow... It is my son who shall reign in Bern! My son, Zephiel! Ha ha ha ha ha! How it gives me such pleasure to say those words!"
3721,"Desmond: Have you said your mind? Well, I have something for you to hear as well."
3722,Hellene: What could it be?
3723,"Desmond: Last night, from the palace, the Fire Emblem was stolen away by some villain."
3724,"Hellene: It can't be! ...Ha ha ha. You are so wicked, Your Majesty. Pray tell, who would believe such a tale? The Fire Emblem is Bern's greatest national treasure. No gem in existence is its equal. Stealing such a heavily guarded object is impossible, is it not?"
3725,"Desmond: Unfortunately, I speak true."
3726,Hellene: No...
3727,"Desmond: You know of the importance of the Fire Emblem. It's the symbol of the heir, the heart of"
3728,"Hellene: No!! Thi-This was your doing, wasn't it? How can you despise Zephiel so? He is of your blood. He is your beloved son, is he not?"
3729,"Desmond: I have heard that Zephiel is... a gifted student, a stunning fighter, excelling in all he tries. And I've also heard that he is much loved by the people."
3730,Hellene: Yes! It is true. All of it! He is a worthy son.
3731,Desmond: I...excelled at neither books nor blades.
3732,Hellene: What do you--
3733,Desmond: I cannot say that I command the love of my subjects... Zephiel and I are opposites in every way. It is hard to believe that he is my son.
3734,"Hellene: Zephiel is Your Majesty's child! Your Grace, you know this is truth!"
3735,"Desmond: Mine or not, without the ceremony... He will not be named heir. Mark my words, and prepare yourself, woman."
3736,Hellene: Your Majesty! King Desmond!! Please... Please wait! He is your heir! Your son! Please... What am I to do? Zephiel...
3737,"Servant: I beg your pardon, Your Hgihness. You have a visitor..."
3738,Hellene: I will see no one. Send him home.
3739,"Servant: Your Highness, I..."
3740,???: It's all right. You may go. I will take care of this.
3741,"Servant: Yes, my lady."
3742,Hellene: Who?
3743,"Louise: Lady Hellene, it's been far too long. It is I, Louise."
3744,Hellene: Louise!? Is it truly you? Ah... Louise...
3745,Louise: What is it? Your eyes are so red. It's a shame to see such beauty marred by tears.
3746,Hellene: There is something... I...
3747,"Louise: If it please you, I would hear your troubles. My husband is here with me. Perhaps he will be able to lend you his aid."
3748,Hellene: Lord Pent is also here? I see... ...... ...To be honest...
3749,Eliwood: Lord Pent! Lady Louise!!
3750,Pent: Sorry to have kept you waiting.
3751,Eliwood: ...How did everything go?
3752,"Pent: ...I can't say it was a complete failure, yet..."
3753,Lyn: What do you mean?
3754,Louise: We've a task to perform.
3755,Hector: What do you mean?
3756,Pent: Queen Hellene is looking for something. If we find it for her...
3757,"Eliwood: She will listen to our request, is that it?"
3758,Pent: We have until the morning of the tenth day from today. ...What will you do? The decision is yours.
3759,Eliwood: ...We'll do it. It is most certainly a test we were destined to take.
3760,"The Bern royal family is a pageant of power, love, and hate. Eliwood finds himself embroiled in their troubles. He has been sent to recover the Bern family treasure: the Fire Emblem. It has been stolen from the palace vault. Eliwood enters the royal palace seeking clues.
"
3761,"Hector and his allies defeat the Black Fang monster, Pascal. However, they learn nothing of the Fire Emblem's location. To escape from the Black Fang, they disguise themselves once more. At Eliwood's suggestion, they head for the royal palace of Bern.
"
3762,Hector: We've finally arrived. I can't believe they built a palace in these mountains.
3763,"Eliwood: Bern is the only country on the continent where wyverns still fly. With its wyvern-riders, I imagine this castle is the best-defended anywhere."
3764,Lyn: I agree. Look at the path leading up the mountain's face. It would be impossible to scale that in a direct assault.
3765,Hector: Defenders positioned higher up would have a clear advantage. Even the best soldiers would be taken out with ease. Hm... Look at that. They don't have any sentries posted. They must have a lot of faith in their defenses.
3766,Eliwood: Look at these surroundings! They probably make do simply with patrols within the castle. The mighty Bern. I'd not like it as an enemy.
3767,"Lyn: And yet, from this impregnable fortress, a treasure was stolen. Perhaps the king really is responsible for all this. It's hard to imagine any thief cracking Bern's defenses."
3768,"Eliwood: You're right. But I can't imagine why the king would do this. To find the Fire Emblem, we're going to need clues."
3769,"Lyn: Listen, why don't we try sneaking into the castle?"
3770,Hector: That's what I was waiting for! I like the way you think.
3771,"Eliwood: Whatever happens, we must not be caught. If it looks impossible, turn around and come back here."
3772,Hector: Got it!
3773,Lyn: Of course!
3774,Lyn: This is... An inner garden?
3775,Eliwood: Shh! Someone's coming this way.
3776,Hector: Here! Into this thicket!!
3777,"Guinivere: Brother! Hello, Zephiel!"
3778,"Zephiel: Ah, Guinivere. Have you been well?"
3779,"Guinivere: Uh-huh! I've been fine. But if you would come and see me every day, I'd be even better! Much, much better!"
3780,"Zephiel: Every day? Well, that's an awful lot, but I'll come by as often as possible. All for you, dear sister."
3781,Guinivere: Yippee!
3782,"???: Guinivere! Guinivere! Where are you, lass?"
3783,"Guinivere: Here I am, Father! Welcome home."
3784,"Desmond: Ah, there you are. Were you a good girl while I was gone? Come, give your father a kiss. You're as adorable as ever."
3785,"Zephiel: Well met, Father."
3786,Desmond: ...Zephiel. Hmph... You take the same unpleasant tone as your mother.
3787,Zephiel: What!? I... I...
3788,Desmond: Silence. What brings you to my castle?
3789,"Zephiel: Ah, yes... Murdock."
3790,"Murdock: Yes, my lord."
3791,Zephiel: We were hunting in the forest earlier. ...We found this and thought Guinivere might like it.
3792,Guinivere: Eeek! A baby fox!? How cute! It's so very cute!! Is it for me? Really?
3793,Zephiel: Do you like it?
3794,"Guinivere: Yes, I do! Thank you. I do love you, Brother!"
3795,"Desmond: ...Guinivere, go play for a while."
3796,"Guinivere: OK! Come on, let's go! You lovely little fox!"
3797,Desmond: ...I've told you to stay away from the castle.
3798,Zephiel: Yes...I know... I beg your pardon. I heard that Guinivere was ill and I was...worried.
3799,"Desmond: Hah, you mean you came to see if she would die, don't you?"
3800,Zephiel: Father...
3801,"Murdock: I beg your pardon, Your Majesty, that..."
3802,"Desmond: Hold your tongue, Murdock! Do not forget whom you serve! The king of Bern!!"
3803,Murdock: ......
3804,"Zephiel: It's all right, Murdock..."
3805,"Zephiel: Father, I would never want to see Guinivere harmed in--"
3806,Desmond: You and your mother think of nothing more than stealing my throne. You plague me. Return to the manse!
3807,Zephiel: ...As you wish. I beg your leave...Father.
3808,"Desmond: ...No matter how I warn him, he comes. Why is it that the very sight of him tries my patience so? He is truly of my own flesh and blood, yet..."
3809,"???: Hee hee hee. It is jealousy, my king."
3810,Desmond: Eh? Who's there?
3811,"Sonia: It is I, Sonia."
3812,Desmond: You... Well? Is the Emblem safe?
3813,Sonia: Yes. I have it in my possession. It is all as we planned.
3814,"Desmond: It is unlikely, but... The queen might attempt to win the Emblem back. Are you prepared?"
3815,Sonia: I will not fail... It is secreted away within the Black Fang's fortress.
3816,"Desmond: Keep it concealed until dusk of the tenth day, then return it to me."
3817,"Sonia: As you will, Your Grace."
3818,Desmond: And what of my other request...
3819,"Sonia: One of the Four Fangs will tend to it. There will be no mistakes. However, General Murdock, the man protecting the prince... He is young, yet well respected. Shall we finish him, too?"
3820,Desmond: ...Murdock... His birth is low. And yet his combat skills have won him the title of Wyvern General. It would be a great blow if Bern were to lose him. I'll think of something to remove him from Zephiel's side. Will that do?
3821,Sonia: Yes. It would be a great help. Wait! ......
3822,Desmond: What? What is it?
3823,Sonia: I...sense someone.
3824,Desmond: Where!?
3825,???: Father! Brother! Where are you?!
3826,Desmond: Do not worry. It is my daughter.
3827,Sonia: Of course. Do not forget the Black Fang's role once we are successful.
3828,Desmond: Of course. Now begone. Quickly.
3829,Sonia: Farewell.
3830,"Guinivere: Zephiel! This kit, it... Hm? Where is my brother?"
3831,Desmond: He had an errand to perform and left.
3832,"Guinivere: Oh, no! No, no, no! I wanted to play!"
3833,"Desmond: Come, Guinivere. I will play with you."
3834,"Guinivere: No! I want to play with him, not you! I'll go and call him back. Here, hold my fox!"
3835,Desmond: ......Attend me!!
3836,"Solder: Yes, my lord."
3837,Desmond: Take this beast and kill it! Do not let Guinivere know what you do.
3838,Soldier: Understood.
3839,"Desmond: ...Zephiel, you knave. Trying to steal my Guinivere's love... ...You will learn your place!"
3840,Hector: That was close... I was afraid they'd catch us.
3841,Eliwood: This is worse than I'd imagined. The Black Fang has already reached the king.
3842,"Lyn: Their plans for Lycia failed, and now they're targeting Bern."
3843,"Hector: If a country as powerful as Bern moves, peace knows no hope."
3844,"Eliwood: What Nergal desires is powerful quintessence. Calling dragons back.. Does he wish to embroil the world in chaos? Whatever his plans, he must be stopped at any cost!"
3845,"Hector: Right. Find the Fire Emblem and return it to the queen. We do that, and she'll point us toward the Shrine of Seals."
3846,Lyn: If we go to the Black Fang fortress...
3847,Eliwood: That's our goal. I must meet with everyone and seek out their fortress.
3848,Ninian: I wonder if Eliwood and the others are well.
3849,"Nils: Please, Ninian. That's all you've spoken of since they left. I understand your concern for Lord Eliwood, but..."
3850,Ninian: Nils! I...
3851,"Nils: You don't have to hide anything from me. But you must not fall in love with him, you know? We...are different from them."
3852,Ninian: ...I know. But I cannot... ......I...
3853,Nils: Ninian! Where are you going?
3854,"Ninian: I need time to think. May I be alone, please?"
3855,Nils: Ninian...
3856,"Hector: We'd better hurry and rejoin the others. Oh, no! Look! It's a wyvern rider!"
3857,Eliwood: She's coming closer... Has she seen us?!
3858,"Lyn: No, it's not us she's seen. It's... It's Nils!!!"
3859,Eliwood: Let's go! Hector!!
3860,Hector: OK!
3861,Nils: Ahh! Who...who are you?
3862,"Vaida: Light green hair, crimson eyes... No mistake. You're one of Lord Nergal's lost toys. Yes! Found you at last!"
3863,Nils: ...What are you? Why can't I sense you!?
3864,"Vaida: What happened to your bodyguards? I heard they were tough. I wanted to see for myself. Well, you're here, so they can't be too far away, can they?"
3865,Nils: ...
3866,"Vaida: C'mon, boy! Scream! Call your friends to you! I grow weary of waiting. I am not known for my patience!!!"
3867,Lyn: I'm the one you're looking for! Unhand the boy!
3868,Vaida: You've come! I've been looking forward to this!
3869,Eliwood: Looking forward... What do you mean?
3870,Vaida: The chance to crush you! Then hand the children over to Lord Nergal.
3871,"Hector: Nergal? So you're one of his dogs, are you?"
3872,"Vaida: ...I'll not be called a dog by you, blackheart! True, we've a contract with the Black Fang, but... I am loyal to one master only! He who sits on the throne of Bern!"
3873,Eliwood: Then why are you in the employ of the Black--
3874,"Vaida: There's been far too much talking. Let's get started, shall we? I've long hungered for someone to test my strength against. Make this last awhile, will you? I want to enjoy this!!"
3875,"Vaida: Listen up, everyone! It's playtime! Come on out!! The palace has promised to stay out of this! Be as wild as you will!!"
3876,Eliwood: Tactician! Our allies are hidden here and there to avoid being spotted. This is not to our advantage. We must gather everyone quickly!!
3877,"Pent: We'll help, too. Tell us what to do."
3878,"Eliwood: You as well, Lady Louise?"
3879,Louise: Of course.
3880,Pent: No need for concern. She is quite skilled with a bow. Those Bern wyvern riders will be sorry to meet her.
3881,"Louise: Despite what you may think, I shoot much better than I dance or sing. I believe I can be of some small assistance."
3882,Eliwood: I understand. Thank you for your help.
3883,Pent: ...Now let me give you this. It's from Lord Athos.
3884,Eliwood: What is it?
3885,"Pent: A Heaven seal... It reveals hidden strengths. It only works for a select few, but..."
3886,Eliwood: It has an air of mystery to it.
3887,Pent: Do you think you can use it?
3888,"Eliwood: ... ... ......No, it won't work for me."
3889,"Pent: Wait for the proper time, and have the other two try it. It might not work now, but I'm sure that you will all be able to use it at some point. Just keep trying."
3890,Eliwood: I understand. Thank you very much.
3891,"Pent: You're Tactician, is that right? Please...forget about my title and standing in my country. You are our tactician, and I will do as you command. Well then, I hope we'll work well together."
3892,"Louise: Mark, you are the tactician for this company, are you not? May our battles together be successful ones."
3893,"Vaida: Pah! I've had it with being pushed here and there! Withdraw!! Ground forces, pull back! And move quickly!!"
3894,Eliwood: I guess that worked out.
3895,Ninian: Lord Eliwood!
3896,Eliwood: Ninian! Nils! Are you both well?
3897,"Nils: What shall we do, Lord Eliwood? Nergal's power... It's returning bit by bit."
3898,Eliwood: What do you mean?
3899,Ninian: That woman you faced... She was protected by Nergal's magic.
3900,Eliwood: Her strength... It came from Nergal?
3901,Ninian: Yes. It won't be long before he's active again. With all his power restored.
3902,Nils: We must hurry and gain the power to oppose him!
3903,Eliwood: We have to recover the Fire Emblem. If we can do that...
3904,Hector: Come on! The palace is in an uproar. This is our chance to slip away!
3905,Lyn: Wait! I have an idea. Let's follow them.
3906,Eliwood: Lyndis?
3907,Lyn: Leave it to me. I think I might be able to find the Black Fang fortress.
3908,"Lyn: This way. The signs are fading, but they're really moving. I think I can track them if they keep this pace."
3909,Hector: Are you sure? Really?
3910,"Lyn: Remember, I'm from Sacae. Bern's foot soldiers are slow and clumsy... And to a Sacaen, men are easier to track than rabbits."
3911,"Hector: What do you want to do, Eliwood."
3912,"Eliwood: Let's put our trust in Lyndis. If anyone can do this, she can."
3913,Hector: Are you serious?
3914,"Lyn: Over here, everyone!"
3915,"They follow the Black Fang due south. Although the trail vanishes, Lyn uses her tracking skills, and the pursuit continues. The path leads up into Bern's impassable mountains. The peaks know no seasons, and the snow covers all in a bright blanket. In this land of blinding reflections, an ancient castle appears.
"
3916,"Sonia: So, in the end, you failed to defeat them, didn't you?"
3917,Vaida: ......
3918,"Sonia: I only introduced you to Lord Nergal out of respect for your rank. I was mistaken, though, to think that a former royal soldier would be--"
3919,"Vaida: Next time will be different, I swear it. I beg of you, give me one more chance!"
3920,"Sonia: Ha ha ha... ""One more chance""? Surely you jest."
3921,"Vaida: Without Lord Nergal's good word, I'll never fly again! Not as a royal wyvern knight, at least! Please! Another chance!!"
3922,"Sonia: Ah, but you're quite skilled at begging, at least. Desist. You have fallen from our graces, and nothing will change that. Just be grateful. You are an outsider, so you are spared the Fang's judgement."
3923,Vaida: ......
3924,Sonia: You stink of failure. Leave me to breathe in peace.
3925,Vaida: ......Hm.
3926,Eliwood: That wyvern rider.. That was the same woman we fought earlier. This proves that they took this mountain path.
3927,Hector: Now... What have we here... What a complicated place.
3928,"Eliwood: It's little more than whispers, but I can hear human voices."
3929,Lyn: Over there! Let's go take a look.
3930,Eliwood: Marcus! Wait here with Ninian and everyone else. Be ready to escape at any time. I'm counting on you!
3931,"Marcus: Yes, sir. I will not fail."
3932,Nino: Really? You're giving me a mission? Really and truly!? Mother!
3933,Sonia: I am. And it's a very big job at that. ...It's for the king of Bern.
3934,Nino: The king!? Such an important job... for me?
3935,Brendan: Sonia? I'm against this!! Giving such a dangerous job to this child...
3936,Nino: Father?
3937,"Sonia: ...You're right, this really is a job for your sons. However, we've seen nothing of them since their last report."
3938,Nino: Lloyd... Linus......
3939,Brendan: ......
3940,Sonia: So my daughter will do this. And I will have no complaints from you about it.
3941,Brendan: ......
3942,Nino: Ah! Father......
3943,Sonia: ...You may do as you please!!
3944,Nino: But...
3945,"Sonia: First, business! Jaffar! Come!"
3946,Nino: Jaffar!
3947,Lyn: Look! That man! He was at the Dragon's Gate.
3948,Hector: Nergal's henchman. No question about it.
3949,Eliwood: ......
3950,Nino: Jaffar! Should you be up? Don't your wounds hurt?
3951,Jaffar: ......
3952,"Sonia: Must you be so discourteous? It really is quite irritating. You heard the king's request, did you not?"
3953,Jaffar: Prince Zephiel... He wants him assassinated.
3954,"Nino: What? The prince? The king wants to kill the prince? Why? He's his son, isn't he?"
3955,Sonia: Nino! Be quiet.
3956,Nino: Ah... I'm sorry.
3957,"Sonia: Jaffar, this mission is yours... and you're to take Nino."
3958,Jaffar: ......You're not serious?
3959,"Sonia: Yes, I'm serious. This girl is my daughter. She must prove herself as soon as possible."
3960,Jaffar: ...Don't do this. This is too much for her.
3961,"Sonia: As long as you're with her, there should be no problem. I'll brook no disagreement. We must have the king in our debt. Those are Lord Nergal's explicit orders."
3962,Jaffar: ......
3963,"Sonia: Nino! You understand the consequences if you fail, don't you?"
3964,Nino: Um... Yes.
3965,Sonia: Then we're off to investigate the prince's manse. I'll provide more details on the way there.
3966,Sonia: Jerme!
3967,Jerme: Yes?
3968,Sonia: Where is Brendan? He just left the room.
3969,Jerme: He went outside with Jan.
3970,"Sonia: ......I wonder what he's about... ...I'll deal with it later. Listen, Jerme. You're in charge of the guard while I'm gone. Do not let anything happen to the item."
3971,Jerme: In charge of the guard... Bah! I was top dog until that cretin Jaffar showed up.
3972,Sonia: Jerme!
3973,"Jerme: ...I know, I know!"
3974,Sonia: Kenneth!
3975,"Kenneth: Yes, Lady Sonia."
3976,Sonia: Where is Brendan? He just left the room.
3977,Kenneth: He went outside with Jan.
3978,"Sonia: ......I wonder what he's about... ...I'll deal with it later. Listen, Kenneth. You're in charge of the guard while I'm gone. Do not let anything happen to the item."
3979,Kenneth: Understood. I will guard it with my life.
3980,Eliwood: Do they seriously mean to assassinate the prince?
3981,"Hector: Aye. On the orders of the king, it would seem. Unbelievable..."
3982,"Lyn: The Emblem is essential to the prince's ceremony, right? Having the Emblem becomes useless if the prince is dead!"
3983,"Eliwood: We must stop the assassination! The girl, Nino... If we speak to her she might understand."
3984,Lyn: Jaffar looks like a dangerous man... But we have no other course of action.
3985,"Jerme: Oh, here you are! How delicious! My blade shall feast well tonight, won't it?"
3986,Eliwood: Oh!!
3987,"Jerme: Now, which...one...first? Wait! Hold it! There are some nasty ones mixed in with the rest. Mustn't get one of them. Might ruin my sword's appetite. You don't mind do you? If I do it this way?"
3988,Eliwood: That's...
3989,Lyn: Eliwood! There's no reason to treat with that madman!! We must find the exit...
3990,"Jerme: You! Woman! You have beautiful skin. If I sliced you into lovely red ribbons with this, would the pieces be as soft and delicate as silk?"
3991,Lyn: You...
3992,Nils: It's no good! Something's blocking our way. We can't get out!!
3993,"Ninian: I can feel an evil power emanating from every foe here. If we do not defeat them all, the barrier will hold strong."
3994,"Jerme: Hyaa ha ha ha haaa! That's Lord Nergal's doing! He knows how I love to slice through people. He lets me do it as often as I want, which really is all the time. He's after something he calls ""quintessence""... I care nothing for it, but... as long as he keeps bringing me people to slash and cut! I am Jerme! The finest assassin the Black Fang have ever known! Now come! My blade hungers!!"
3995,Eliwood: Gone...
3996,Ninian: ...It's all right. He's still close... In this building...somewhere.
3997,"Nils: We've got to defeat him and destroy this barrier! Otherwise, we'll never leave!!"
3998,Eliwood: Mark! We have to find that man and escape this place! What are your orders?!
3999,"Kenneth: Hello trespassers. I bid you welcome. Imagine, the stronghold of a guild of assassins, infiltrated. Quite amusing, isn't it? Heh heh heh heh."
4000,Eliwood: Oh!!
4001,"Jerme: However, you shall not leave. Sonia has given me authority while she is away."
4002,Eliwood: You... You're a holy man. What are you doing in this place?
4003,"Kenneth: Are you referring to my relationship with the ""gods""? Are you still held in the thrall of such a concept? You've met Lord Nergal, haven't you? Then there is something you must know. Gods are lies created by the weakness in all mankind. ...If a god truly exists, then it is my lord Nergal. Only him."
4004,Eliwood: Insane...
4005,Hector: Eliwood! Waste no time with that madman!! Let's get out of--
4006,Nils: We can't! Something's blocking our way. We can't get out!!
4007,Ninian: ...That man. The one in front of you... A surge of evil...
4008,"Kenneth: Nothing is more beautiful than the suffering of men. When I'm watching, I'm afloat in an ocean of pure bliss... I will watch you for a long, long time."
4009,Eliwood: Gone...
4010,Ninian: ...It's all right. He's still close... In this building...somewhere.
4011,"Nils: We've got to defeat him and destroy this barrier! Otherwise, we'll never leave!!"
4012,Eliwood: Mark! We have to find that man and escape this place! What are your orders?!
4013,"Geitz: Come on, Mark! Do you really want me? Oh, bother. I really hate the cold. What? Everyone's counting on me? ... Oh, fine ..."
4014,"Wallace: Huh huh huh huh. You’ve done well to choose me for this, Mark! Weaklings! Their pathetic attacks mean nothing to me! I’ll cut through this snow like a new-forged blade!"
4015,Eliwood: Who are you?
4016,Karel: Karel.
4017,"Eliwood: Are you fighting the Black Fang, too?"
4018,Karel: I heard the Black Fang was gathering recruits. I'm here to challenge them.
4019,Eliwood: Do you... Do you have a reason to do so?
4020,Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You...
4021,Eliwood: What?
4022,"Karel: You are quite good, but you will improve. Very good. I will join you."
4023,Eliwood: You're going to help me and my friends? But...why?
4024,"Karel: Someday, you will be a great swordfighter. It would be a waste for that skill to die here. I must have you... stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation."
4025,Eliwood: ......
4026,Karel: Shall we continue? The feast awaits...
4027,Hector: Who are you?
4028,Karel: Karel.
4029,"Hector: Karel, what are you doing in this place?"
4030,Karel: The Black Fang is gathering recruits. I want to hone my blade on them.
4031,Hector: What? Do you have...a reason?
4032,Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You...
4033,Hector: What?
4034,Karel: You are unpolished...but powerful. Very well. I will join you.
4035,"Hector: You're going to lend us your blade? That's a nice gesture and all, but... Why?"
4036,Karel: You will someday be a famed general. It would be a waste for that power to be lost here. I must have you...stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation.
4037,Hector: ......
4038,Karel: Shall we continue? The feast awaits...
4039,Lyn: Oh! Who are you?
4040,Karel: Karel.
4041,Lyn: You're a...swordfighter from Sacae. Are you fighting the Black Fang as well?
4042,Karel: The Black Fang is gathering recruits. I want to hone my blade on them.
4043,Lyn: Why would you... Do you have a reason to?
4044,Karel: My sword is my life. My sword is my reason. You are... So beautiful...
4045,Lyn: Pardon?
4046,"Karel: Your blade and mine are different, yet...Your swordplay is truly beautiful. Very well. I will join you."
4047,Lyn: You're going to help us? But...why?
4048,Karel: Someday you will be a renowned swordfighter. Losing you here would be a waste. I must see you... stronger. I will wait for that time with much anticipation.
4049,Lyn: ......
4050,Karel: Shall we continue. The feast awaits...
4051,"Eliwood: You... Can it really be? Is it you, Harken?"
4052,Harken: ......Ah!
4053,"Eliwood: Wait, please! You're Harken, a knight of Pherae, aren't you?"
4054,Harken: Lord Eliwood?
4055,Eliwood: I heard that all my father's men had fallen defending him. It's good to see you well. Why didn't you return to Pherae?
4056,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sworn lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4057,Eliwood: Harken...
4058,"Harken: Before Nergal's magic, we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless..."
4059,Eliwood: Nergal...
4060,Harken: I heard he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
4061,"Eliwood: And that's what brought you here... In that case, Harken, you should come with us."
4062,"Harken: Forgive me, Lord Eliwood... I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs."
4063,Eliwood: Hold! Harken!! Do you think my father would want that?
4064,"Harken: Lord Eliwood, please..."
4065,"Eliwood: Join me, Harken. Neither my father nor I would condone such a senseless death. Help me fulfill my father's one ambition and restore peace."
4066,Harken: ...I understand. My life is yours. May it serve you better than it served your father.
4067,"Isadora: You! Can it truly be you, Harken?"
4068,Harken: Isadora!?
4069,"Isadora: Wait! You are Harken, a knight of Pherae, are you not?"
4070,Harken: Isadora...
4071,Isadora: You... You're alive. We'd heard that all of you had perished. Thank goodness... Thank goodness you're well. But how is it that you're here?
4072,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4073,Isadora: Harken...
4074,"Harken: Before that man's magic... we were powerless. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I... I could do nothing..."
4075,Isadora: ......
4076,"Harken: I learned that the man who took Lord Elbert...Nergal, shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath."
4077,"Isadora: ...... Lord Eliwood... He's here, too. Come, Harken. You must join us."
4078,"Harken: ...I cant, Isadora. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs."
4079,"Isadora: Wait! Please, Harken! Don't be foolish!"
4080,Harken: Isadora...
4081,"Isadora: I've just now found you again when I thought you were lost. If you vanish from my life once more... Please, Harken. Do not waste this chance. I beg of you..."
4082,"Harken: ...... I understand. Isadora, I'll do as you ask. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood."
4083,"Marcus: Harken! You are a knight of Pherae! It is you, isn't it, Harken?"
4084,Harken: ...... Lord Marcus...
4085,"Marcus: I received reports that said the entire elite guard had fallen... It looks like you survived. Tell me, why did you not report to Pherae?"
4086,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4087,Marcus: Harken...
4088,"Harken: Before Nergal's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless..."
4089,Marcus: Nergal...
4090,Harken: I learned he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
4091,"Marcus: ...... Harken, come with me. You must aid Lord Eliwood in this war."
4092,Harken: But...I...
4093,"Marcus: Do not waste the life you swore to Pherae. We are knights, Harken. Be mindful of your oath. You must not die here. For the sake of our fallen master ...live now and, fight."
4094,"Harken: I understand. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood."
4095,Lowen: You... Can it be? Lord Harken?
4096,Harken: ......!
4097,"Lowen: Wait, please. It has to be you... Lord Harken, a knight of Pherae!"
4098,Harken: You... You're one of Lord Marcus's young men.
4099,"Lowen: Yes! I am Lowen. I'm currently traveling with Lord Eliwood. I'd heard that your entire company fell, Lord Harken... And yet, at least you survived! Lord Eliwood will be pleased. Why... Why are you in this place?"
4100,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4101,Lowen: Lord Harken...
4102,"Harken: Before that monster's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless..."
4103,Lowen: ......
4104,"Harken: I learned that the man who took Lord Elbert...Nergal, shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath."
4105,"Lowen: What a tale... Come, you can join us, Lord Harken."
4106,"Harken: I cant, Lowen. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs."
4107,"Lowen: Wait, please! Lord Elbert would not have wanted this!"
4108,Harken: Lowen...
4109,"Lowen: Please, be prudent. Lord Eliwood, Lord Marcus, and Lady Isabella... I know that none of them would want you to do this."
4110,"Harken: ...... You're right. You speak the truth, young Lowen. Let us go and see Lord Eliwood. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood."
4111,Hector: You-- It can't be... Harken?
4112,Harken: ...Oh!
4113,"Hector: Hey, hang on! Wait a moment! Wait! You're one of Pherae's knights! Harken, right?"
4114,Harken: ...Lord Hector.
4115,"Hector: You were one of Lord Elbert's sworn men, right? I'd heard all his knights died on Valor... Why didn't you return and report to Eliwood."
4116,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4117,Hector: ...
4118,"Harken: Before Nergal's magic, we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless..."
4119,Hector: That dog Nergal...
4120,Harken: I learned he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
4121,"Hector: And now you are here. You can fight with us, Harken. Eliwood is here as well."
4122,"Harken: Forgive me, Lord Hector. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs."
4123,"Hector: Hold, Harken! Do you think that's what Lord Elbert would ask for?"
4124,Harken: ......
4125,"Hector: I'm not from Pherae, so it may not be my place to say, but... Eliwood waited for you... for any of you to return."
4126,Harken: ...Lord Eliwood.
4127,"Hector: Eliwood is in a war. If you're a true knight of Pherae, you need to be by his side."
4128,Harken: ...I understand. My life is his. May it serve him better than it served his father.
4129,Isadora: Young sir... Are you not Sir Harken?
4130,Harken: ......Oh!!
4131,"Isadora: Hold! Are you not Sir Harken, a knight of Pherae?"
4132,Harken: ...Sir Oswin.
4133,Isadora: I'd heard that your entire company had fallen. It is good to see that you are alive and well. Is Lord Eliwood aware that you survived?
4134,Harken: I failed in my duty to protect my sword lord... I am not worthy of the honor of being a knight of Pherae.
4135,Isadora: Sir Harken...
4136,"Harken: Before Nergal's magic... we were annihilated. When Lord Elbert was taken away, I was...powerless..."
4137,Isadora: Nergal...
4138,Harken: I learned that he shared some connection to the Black Fang. I searched the continent for signs of them... I intended to strike against them with my final breath.
4139,"Isadora: I see... Be that as it may, Lord Harken, you may now travel with us. Lord Eliwood is also with us."
4140,"Harken: Please, Sir Oswin... I need you to understand. I would rather die a knight than live in shame. I will trade my life for many of theirs."
4141,"Isadora: Sir Harken, did you not swear a life of service to Pherae?"
4142,Harken: ......
4143,"Isadora: As a knight of Ostia, it may not be my place to speak, but... Lord Eliwood waited for you... for any of you to return."
4144,Harken: ...Lord Eliwood.
4145,"Isadora: Lord Eliwood waits for you still. We are knights, bound by duty to the houses we serve. You can still be of service to your lord and master."
4146,"Harken: ...You are right, Sir Oswin. Forgive my weakness. My life for my dead lord and for his son, Eliwood."
4147,Eliwood: Everyone is being driven mad by Nergal...
4148,"Lyn: It must be terrifying, to lose yourself entirely... To fall completely under the sway of Nergal's power... ...Hey! What could this be?"
4149,Eliwood: It can't be... the Fire Emblem?
4150,Hector: So this madman had it all along? Let's take it and go!
4151,Lyn: We've finally gotten it back... Let's not waste our good fortune.
4152,Hector: Eliwood! There's no reason for us to stay any longer!
4153,Eliwood: I know! Let's make haste for the manse! We must stop the assassination! We cannot let the prince's life be put in jeopardy!
4154,"Sonia: You know your role, yes? The plan must be carried out tonight."
4155,Nino: Mother...just once...if only for a little while...may I...hold your hand?
4156,"Sonia: Nino, you know how I abhor such displays."
4157,Nino: I... I know. But...I may not get another chance... And I thought...
4158,Sonia: ...Very well.
4159,Nino: Huh?
4160,"Sonia: If you complete this mission, I'll hold your hand as often as you like. I will even hug you and stroke your face."
4161,"Nino: Oh, really!? Then I must do my best! I will, I will! I will succeed!! Wait for me, Mother!"
4162,Sonia: I will. Be careful!
4163,Nino: ...All right!! I'll be back!!
4164,"Sonia: Ah, Jaffar, wait here for a moment."
4165,Jaffar: ...
4166,Sonia: It's about tonight's mission...
4167,Jaffar: What is it?
4168,"Sonia: Once you've killed the prince, kill Nino, too."
4169,Jaffar: What!?
4170,"Sonia: The assassinations... Both come directly by the king's request. The prince is well loved, and his death will trigger much chaos. If the assassin is not caught and hanged immediately, the chaos will engulf Bern. A scapegoat is needed. Do you understand?"
4171,Jaffar: Nino is your daughter!!
4172,"Sonia: She is trash. Garbage. Human refuse. I'm just happy at last to have found a use for her. She did say she would do anything to please her loving mother, did she not? Her death will please me more than her living ever did."
4173,Jaffar: ......
4174,Sonia: ...What is it? Do you have something to say?
4175,Jaffar: ......This...has nothing to do with me.
4176,"Sonia: When Lord Nergal found you as an orphan, he chose you because of your callous heart and your skill with a blade. Lord Nergal does not give second chances. Do not forget."
4177,Jaffar: ...
4178,"The Bern royal family is a pageant of power, love, and hate. Eliwood finds himself embroiled in their troubles. He has been sent to recover the Bern family treasure: the Fire Emblem. It has been stolen from the palace vault. Relying on information that he has uncovered in the city, Hector heads south to an area filled with lakes and marshes.
"
4179,"Sonia: You there, open the cell."
4180,Black Fang: Lady Sonia? Bu-But… the prisoner… My orders are that none may see him.
4181,Sonia: Open the cell. …Did you hear me?
4182,Black Fang: Yes… Yes!
4183,Pascal: Oho…  Aren’t you a lovely one? I pray you’ll forgive the cramped quarters.
4184,"Sonia: Pascal Grentzer, once and former count of Bern’s Landskron. A man whose battlefield prowess was feared far and wide… Until you invited your citizens to your castle and slaughtered them. Stripped of your title, you fled the king and joined the Black Fang. Is that an accurate summary?"
4185,"Pascal: Hmmm… You know me well, it would seem."
4186,Sonia: You were even made one of the Four Fangs. Spending the rest of your days in this place seems so wasteful. I’ve heard that Brendan calls you “the Beast.” A monster who would massacre an entire village to kill one person.
4187,"Pascal: He doesn’t know how to enjoy his work. “Never harm any innocents.” Bah. “The Black Fang brings justice to those above the law.” Ha ha ha… Quite droll jokes, don’t you think?"
4188,"Sonia: I’m going to release you, Count. I’ve a job for you. Something you’ll love. What do you say? Are you interested?"
4189,"Pascal: Hmmm… Why not? It can’t be worse than rotting here. And I must say, I do love my work… Now, tell me. What is the name of my target?"
4190,"Hector: This is a really remote area, isn’t it?"
4191,Eliwood: Yeah. Few people call this area home.
4192,"Lyn: Hector, are you sure about this? Is the Fire Emblem really here?"
4193,"Hector: Yes, I paid a small ransom for this information. There’s no mistake. Look! Do you see those three run-down fortresses? I was told the thieves who base themselves there stole the Emblem."
4194,Lyn: Thieves. Wonder if it’s true.
4195,Eliwood: We’ll simply have to go and confirm it for ourselves.
4196,Hector: Come on. Let’s go!
4197,"Lyn: Oh! Wait, you two! This looks… It’s them!"
4198,Pascal: It’s about time. Shall we get started?
4199,"Black Fang: Lo…Lord Pascal, are you sure? Shouldn’t we tell the chief we’ve found them?"
4200,"Pascal: You don’t understand, do you? If we tell anyone, the Four Fangs will take over. I will not let my prey be snatched away by those spoiled children."
4201,Black Fang: But… But…
4202,"Pascal: If you wish to be executed for desertion, I’ll not stop you from fleeing. I think it would be more fun to fight though, don’t you? Shall we proceed, gentlemen?"
4203,Lyn: …Looks like we’re completely surrounded.
4204,"Hector: Bah, I don’t think we’ll lose if we fight, but… These are not the most favorable conditions. OK! I don’t care who, but someone needs to break out and seize those fortresses. Got that!? We seize all three of them!"
4205,"Florina: Oh, Mark."
4206,"Fiora: We’re moving out, too, right, Mark? Let’s go, Florina."
4207,Florina: OK… But there are so many of them. If only Farina were here with us…
4208,"Fiora: Florina, it’s not helping us to talk about her now. Now, Mark. Give us our orders."
4209,Hector: That’s it! It’s finished! You’re not nearly good enough to trap us!
4210,Lyn: We should have listened to Eliwood. We should’ve gone toward the palace and avoided this trap.
4211,Hector: No sense worrying about it now. What we need to worry about is where we go from here.
4212,"Lyn: Now you try and talk sense? You really are something else, Hector."
4213,"Hector: Can’t hold a candle to you, though."
4214,Lyn: What did you say?
4215,"Eliwood: Peace! Both of you! Anytime we’re able to weaken our foe, we’ve done well. Now we’ve got to get out of here. No telling when reinforcements might arrive."
4216,Hector: All right. Let’s go.
4217,Lyn: You’re right. Let’s hurry.
4218,"Two assassins in the employ of the Black Fang move in. They've been set loose in the palace to murder the crown prince, Zephiel. Eliwood hurries to prevent them from fulfilling their contract.
"
4219,Nino: The prince's room... Is that the door?
4220,Jaffar: ......
4221,"Nino: General Murdock, the prince's bodyguard, should be away. The king concocted some errand to call him from Zephiel's side... There are no guards around. This is an...easy job, isn't it? I... I can do this! This is my first mission, you know? I guess I'm a little nervous, but... I mustn't fail. Mustn't let Mother down."
4222,Jaffar: ......
4223,"Nino: Are you ready, Jaffar?"
4224,"Jaffar: I've...no desire to be a part of your blundering... If you fail, I will, without hesitation, finish the target and then you."
4225,Nino: What!?
4226,"Jaffar: Do not be so naive as to expect help from ""friends."" ...Remember that."
4227,"Nino: I...I knew that. Don't have to tell me... I'm a member of the Black Fang, after all. Ha ha..."
4228,Jaffar: ......
4229,"Nino: ...I won't fail. I will become worthy... I will. Mother will be proud of me. She will see the daughter I've become, and she will love me."
4230,"Nino: ...There are no guards. It's just like we were told, but...something's strange."
4231,Jaffar: ......
4232,Nino: Listen! A voice! Someone's talking in the room!
4233,Jaffar: No... Someone's praying.
4234,"Nino: You're right... It's the prince, isn't it? I wonder what he's praying for."
4235,"Zephiel: I offer this prayer unto thee: My coming-of-age ceremony is tomorrow. As the prince of Bern, I've tried... I've tried my best not to be an embarrassment to my father. I know I've not met with his expectations. But I will try harder. I will please him. I vow to do better. For him."
4236,Nino: ......
4237,"Zephiel: ......Hear me: Tomorrow, I will be a man... So this is my last wish as a foolish child. It's the same one I've asked of you every night for all these years, but... Please, bring Father and Mother together again. Please, let the day come when Guinivere and I and her mother... When all of us can live together happily in the castle."
4238,Nino: ......
4239,Jaffar: It's time...
4240,Nino: Oh! Jaffar...
4241,Jaffar: ...
4242,Zephiel: What!? Villain... ...
4243,"Jaffar: That will leave him unconscious for some time. Now, the time has come for you to do your part..."
4244,Nino: ......
4245,Jaffar: ...Do it.
4246,Nino: ...O-OK.
4247,Jaffar: ......
4248,Nino: I...cannot.
4249,Jaffar: What!? What did you say?
4250,"Nino: Listen to him... All he wants is his parents' love... To be accepted... That's all...... He's just like me. No matter how I try, Mother always looks at me as if I were nothing. Her eyes are so filled with disappointment. She's never held me... not even once......."
4251,Jaffar: Stop this foolishness! I told you! I will not permit you to ruin my opportunity!
4252,"Nino: I know... Do as you must, Jaffar. I won't resist. You can do it easily. But...please don't hurt the prince. ...For pity's sake..."
4253,Jaffar: !!
4254,Nino: ...I'm ready to die.
4255,Jaffar: ...... ...Come.
4256,Nino: What?
4257,Jaffar: We're leaving. Hurry.
4258,Nino: Jaffar?
4259,Jaffar: ...This is it. Come here.
4260,"Nino: Bu-But if you do this... Jaffar, you'll..."
4261,Jaffar: Don't worry about me. Hurry up. ...No!
4262,"Ursula: Hello, Jaffar. Finished already? Such magnificent skill. Is this why they call you the Angel of Death? Sonia told me that you were behaving oddly, but... It appears her fears were groundless."
4263,Nino: I'm sorry! It's not Jaffar's fault! It was me! The prince... I couldn't...
4264,Jaffar: Nino!
4265,Ursula: What's all this? Why is the girl still alive?
4266,Nino: What?
4267,Jaffar: ......
4268,"Ursula: You received Lady Sonia's orders, did you not? You were to dispose of the worthless little--"
4269,Nino: No!!
4270,Jaffar: Hold your tongue. You will not speak another word.
4271,"Ursula: ......So that's how it is? Jaffar, do you plan on betraying Lord Nergal?"
4272,"Jaffar: I will not let Nino die. Get in my way, and I'll kill you."
4273,Nino: Jaffar!
4274,"Ursula: Ha ha... So you have some human emotion in you after all. You always seemed just like those creepy morphs. I bet you didn't kill the prince, either. ......Maxime!"
4275,Maxime: Yes! I'm here!
4276,Ursula: Take your men and put out all of the lights. Block all the entrances. Your targets are Prince Zephiel and two traitors. Finish this before we draw attention to ourselves. Go!!!
4277,Jaffar: Go now... I will buy you time.
4278,"Nino: N-No! You must come, too, Jaffar!"
4279,Jaffar: Nino... You must live. You are worthy of living.
4280,Nino: No! Wait! Don't go! Jaffar!!
4281,Eliwood: This is the royal manse.
4282,Lyn: The lights have been doused. That's the sound of fighting. What's going on?
4283,"Hector: I don't know, but if they're still fighting, we might not be too late! Let's hurry, Eliwood!"
4284,Eliwood: We have to get inside! We have to protect the prince!!
4285,"Harken: Are you our tactician, Mark? I am Harken. I beg your forbearance. Lord Eliwood has ordered me to follow your commands in combat. I care not where I meet death. Just guide me wisely."
4286,"Karel: Your name is Mark, correct? A tactician? I see. You use wisdom as your blade… Interesting… Mark… I will remember your name."
4287,"Zephiel: Ahh... Ow... What's... My room... That man... He's gone. What's going on? Ah! We're under attack! Coming this way... 10...20... I have to get away... No... That's wrong. That's not the way. If I run, they'll simply follow and surround me... Rather than run, I should wait and face them here."
4288,Nino: Jaffar!
4289,Jaffar: Nino? ......I told you to flee.
4290,"Nino: No, these people came and helped me! Hurry, Jaffar! Come with me!"
4291,Jaffar: Go. There's no need to save a life without worth.
4292,Nino: Jaffar...
4293,Jaffar: I am a corpse. I have been dead since the day I was born. Leave me...
4294,"Nino: No! If you're not coming, then I'm staying! I do not want you to die, Jaffar!"
4295,Jaffar: Nino... ......
4296,Ursula: Tell me...are you afraid to die?
4297,Ursula: I cannot understand you. You serve perfection in the form of our masters. Yet you abandon such happiness?
4298,Jaffar: ……I ensure that Nino lives. That’s all.
4299,"Ursula: Why won’t you die as Lady Sonia wishes? You, born of garbage. This was your one chance to be useful."
4300,Nino: My mother… She would not say such things. I…don’t believe it.  I don’t believe anything you have to say!
4301,Ursula: Stupid child… I’ll see that you don’t suffer at least.
4302,Ursula: ...Uww...gaa... ......This can't...Lady...Son...ia...
4303,Zephiel: Ah! The lights are back. ...The rebels...What's happened? I have to make sure Mother is well! Hello! Is anyone there!?
4304,Nino: Jaffar!!
4305,Jaffar: Nino...
4306,Nino: I'm...glad you're well...
4307,Jaffar: ......
4308,Eliwood: ......
4309,Jaffar: Why do you not kill me?
4310,"Eliwood: If we did that, Nino might die as well."
4311,Lyn: You didn't take the prince's life. So we won't take yours. It's that simple.
4312,Jaffar: So naive. Do you know how many of your friends I've killed?
4313,Hector: You monster! I'll--
4314,Eliwood: Hector!! Calm yourself!
4315,Hector: Bah!
4316,"Eliwood: Some sins cannot be forgiven, but now... We need all the help we can get to defeat Nergal."
4317,Jaffar: ......
4318,"Eliwood: Jaffar... You were planning on throwing your life away, correct? If you've come to regret so many of your past actions, then fight with us."
4319,Jaffar: Regret? Such emotions mean nothing...
4320,Nino: Jaffar!
4321,Jaffar: ......If you want me to...I will...do it.
4322,Nino: Jaffar!!
4323,"Lyn: That's good, isn't it, Nino?"
4324,Nino: Mm! Thank you! Thank you!!
4325,Hector: ...
4326,Eliwood: Ah! Hector...
4327,Limstella: Ursula... Beyond hearing so soon?... ......This is quite excellent quintessence. I believe Lord Nergal will be pleased.
4328,Limstella: Ursula...
4329,"Ursula: Limste--my lady Limstella. I am prepared. The only reward for failure is death. However, I must give my report to Lady Sonia..."
4330,Limstella: That won't be necessary.
4331,Ursula: Urrgh!!
4332,Ursula: ...Urrg...........
4333,Limstella: This is quite excellent quintessence. I believe Lord Nergal will be pleased.
4334,"Murdock: ...What could His Majesty be thinking? Detaining me for so long, with no just cause! What!? No... It can't be... The prince..."
4335,Soldier: Co-Commander! Commander Murdock!! You... You must come...
4336,Murdock: What's happened!?
4337,Servant: My apologies for the wait. The queen will see you now.
4338,Pent: Very well.
4339,Louise: Let us proceed.
4340,"Hector: The queen of Bern... Even if it is a private audience, courtly niceties aren't my strong suit."
4341,"Lyn: Mine, either."
4342,Eliwood: ...Let's go.
4343,"Hellene: Ah, so you've returned. And you were successful? You recovered the Fire Emblem safely?"
4344,Eliwood: ...Queen Hellene. Has no one told you? Last night in the manse...
4345,"Hellene: Oh, something about assassins sneaking in, wasn't it? I've no time for such trifles. Quickly, the Emblem."
4346,Eliwood: ......
4347,"Hellene: Ah... Without a doubt, this is the Fire Emblem. Ha ha! With this, my Zephiel holds rightful claim to the succession! Now, it will never pass to that annoying Guinivere... Ha ha ha."
4348,Eliwood: Queen Hellene...
4349,"Hellene: Oh, yes. I'd forgotten. Your promised reward. The road to the Shrine of Seals, was it not?"
4350,Eliwood: I have a pressing question to ask of you first. What is His Royal Highness Prince Zephiel to you?
4351,Hellene: I...beg your pardon?
4352,"Eliwood: HIs Highness Zephiel is your trueborn son, isn't he? Or is he, like the Fire Emblem, nothing more than a tool for securing the throne?"
4353,Hellene: How dare you! Such insolence! To whom do you think you are speaking!?
4354,Eliwood: This has nothing to do with title! You are free to possess your desires and aspirations. But your own innocent son... How can you do anything that places His Highness's life at risk!?
4355,Hellene: What? What do you mean? Of what do you speak...
4356,Lyn: Didn't you hear us? Assassins nearly killed--
4357,Eliwood: Lyndis. That's enough. ...I beg your leave.
4358,Hellene: Wait right there! We are not finished! Someone! Someone stop those insolent children! Someone!
4359,Murdock: My lady Queen.
4360,Hellene: Murdock! I thought you'd been summoned to the castle by His Majesty.
4361,"Murdock: That's correct. I've only just returned. One of my men told me all that happened last night. There's something that I must inform you of, Your Majesty."
4362,"Hector: Well, that's that, huh?"
4363,"Eliwood: ......Lord Pent, Lady Louise, I ruined a perfectly good opportunity. I'm terribly sorry."
4364,Pent: You said nothing that I did not agree with. Do not think long on it.
4365,"Louise: Lady Hellene has changed. Before she got married, she was a kind woman who wanted to be a good wife and a good mother."
4366,"Pent: She and the king are ill matched. She has suffered much. And now, she is obsessed with the succession. Such a sad life..."
4367,Lyn: ......His parents are alive. Yet they're both awful. I feel so sorry for him.
4368,"Eliwood: Even if it was just, I should have left it unsaid. I angered the queen, and in doing so lost the only aid we had in Bern."
4369,"Hector: It's over and done with. No sense worrying about it now. Let's consider our next course of action. Wait, who's there?"
4370,Hellene: Go no farther.
4371,Hector: Queen Hellene?!
4372,Eliwood: What are you... Where are your guards?
4373,"Hellene: Your name... It is Eliwood, yes? Take this book and this seal. My reward to you."
4374,Eliwood: Your Majesty?
4375,"Hellene: This book contains the road to the Shrine of Seals. The seal was a wedding present from Count Reglay from Etruria. I was saving it for Zephiel, but... I believe at this time that you need it more. Furthermore, your path will remain clear for the next three days. No matter what happens during that time, Bern's soldiers will not move. I can make no promises about the king's own troops, though."
4376,"Eliwood: You've done more than enough. You have my heartfelt gratitude. But, Your Majesty...why all of this for us?"
4377,"Hellene: I want to thank you, not as a queen, but as a mother. For saving my son, I am forever in your debt. Now, you should get going."
4378,Eliwood: ...Queen Hellene.
4379,Hellene: Zephiel.
4380,Zephiel: Mother. Is something amiss?
4381,Hellene: You... You've endured much heartache because of me. ...I'm sorry.
4382,Zephiel: Th-That's not so!
4383,"Hellene: Zephiel... My dear, irreplaceable son. From this day forward... I want us to live together as one loving family. Your father and I...and your sister, Guinivere, too."
4384,Zephiel: Mother...
4385,"Hellene: I am ashamed of the way I have behaved. The king may not forgive me for the woman I have been. Yet I shall make recompense, no matter the time. I want to change. If I speak to him from the heart, someday, he will understand. After all...we are a family."
4386,Zephiel: That's right! He will see.
4387,"Hector: So the book is a map, but what's this...""seal""?"
4388,Eliwood: This is a...Heaven seal. To receive something so valuable...
4389,"Hector: She really listened to you, didn't she? Let's take them and go!"
4390,"Eliwood: She listened to us, didn't she?"
4391,Lyn: That's right. All of us!
4392,Hector: I guess...
4393,"Eliwood: Let's make for the Shrine of Seals. Once we make it there, something's bound to happen!!"
4394,"Jaffar and Nino, Black Fang assassins. Befriended by Eliwood, they now join his group. That night...
"
4395,"Jaffar and Nino, Black Fang assassins. Although Hector cannot forget his hatred for Nergal's former henchman, Jaffar, Hector allows him to join the group, with Nino at his side. That night...
"
4396,Nino: Hey!
4397,Jaffar: It's very late. Where are you going?
4398,Nino: ...Jaffar.
4399,Jaffar: To Sonia?
4400,Nino: ...Unh.
4401,Jaffar: Do you know her whereabouts?
4402,"Nino: The mountain fortress has been discovered, so... I think she's in the other place."
4403,Jaffar: The Water Temple? ...... What about them?
4404,"Nino: I haven't told them. They're all good people, so they would know I'm not lying. And yet... I want to see Mother. I want to hear the truth from her. So..."
4405,Jaffar: Nino... Sentiment will not protect you from that woman.
4406,Nino: I know that! But she's my mother!! I'm her flesh and blood. She's the only mother I have!!
4407,Jaffar: ...That is something I cannot understand...
4408,Nino: Ah! I'm sorry... I didn't mean...
4409,Jaffar: It's nothing.
4410,"Nino: Jaffar, I truly am sorry."
4411,"Jaffar: I will not let you go alone. If you go, I go with you. OK?"
4412,Nino: Jaffar...
4413,Lyn: I wanted to know where she was slipping off to in the dead of night... ...Nino...
4414,Hector: ......
4415,Eliwood: I agree with Jaffar. There's no way Sonia will be moved by Nino's feelings.
4416,Lyn: Are we just going to let them go?
4417,"Eliwood: No, we're going to follow them right away."
4418,Lyn: Of course we are!
4419,Hector: .......
4420,"Lyn: What are you doing, Hector? Hurry!"
4421,"Hector: Jaffar's a killer. He's slaughtered our friends. I can't forgive him. Eliwood, is all this necessary? Do we need his strength so much that we now must rescue him?"
4422,"Eliwood: No, that's not it. I wanted those two to live on. Their lives... They've been so hard. That's why I said what I did. My feelings were confirmed in Bern. The Black Fang is not all evil. They're being manipulated by Nergal. Some of them must be fighting against their better judgment."
4423,Hector: Is that what you believe about Jaffar?
4424,Eliwood: I don't know. But you've seen how he behaves around Nino... He seems like a completely different person than the man we fought at the Dragon's Gate.
4425,"Lyn: I feel the same way. Hector, how about you?"
4426,"Hector: He has killed my friends. He is my enemy. No matter what happens, that will never change."
4427,Lyn: So you'll let them die?
4428,Hector: That's not what I said! I want him to stay alive. He must live...so that he can suffer for all he's done! There! Satisfied?
4429,Eliwood: Hector...
4430,"Hector: I've said my peace. I'm done. I won't do any more ranting. ......Sorry about that. Now, let's go! Hurry up, you two!"
4431,Lyn: Wha--Wai-Wait up!
4432,"Eliwood: Let's go, Tactician. We can't let the Black Fang go unattended. It's time we turned the tables on Nergal!!"
4433,Limstella: Sonia.
4434,"Sonia: Pah. Take heed how casually you call a human by name, you puppet. ...Now what do you want?"
4435,Limstella: Eliwood is alive. Lord Nergal's orders have not yet been fulfilled.
4436,"Sonia: Silence, you abomination!! I know that. Though the Four Fangs are gone, I'm still here... I will finish Eliwood and his friends with my own two hands!"
4437,"???: ...Sonia! Where are you, Sonia?!"
4438,"Brendan: Sonia, I must speak... Hm? Who's that?"
4439,"Sonia: ...Oh, well... I suppose it's best I was done with you anyway. Hee hee... Those annoying brothers were all that prevented me from acting sooner."
4440,Brendan: Sonia...you...
4441,"Sonia: I got close to you so that I could take control of the Black Fang. Take a look around you. Not a familiar face to be seen, is there? I've been replacing them one by one... Hee hee. They're all Lord Nergal's puppets. His morphs!!"
4442,Brendan: So...you've betrayed me.
4443,"Sonia: You've finally noticed... You're a fool, Brendan Reed! Your own sons suspected me right from the beginning. Every minute I spent with you, every caress... It was loathsome!! It was all for Lord Nergal. All to control the Four Fangs. Now it's over. Die for me now, will you? Die for your beloved wife!"
4444,Brendan: Sonia! You inhuman monster!!!
4445,Brendan: Aaargh... Lloyd... Linus... Forgive your...foolish...father......
4446,Sonia: Ow... He can't just die... Has to be the Black Fang leader even to the bitter end.
4447,Limstella: Brendan Reed... What magnificent essence. I will deliver it to Lord Nergal at once.
4448,Sonia: Be sure to tell him that it was I who killed Brendan!! ...Ooh!
4449,Limstella: You appear to be injured. Shall I take over your duties?
4450,Sonia: Don't be ridiculous! I will never let a creature like you seize the glory that is mine! I was chosen by Lord Nergal himself! I'm a perfect being!
4451,Limstella: ......
4452,Sonia: I will take care of Eliwood and his companions. I! Sonia!
4453,Jan: Com-Com...Commander... They... They're monsters......
4454,"Nino: Uncle Jan! Is that you, Uncle?"
4455,Jan: Nino!? Why have you come back?
4456,Nino: I...wanted to speak with Mother.
4457,Jan: Flee this place!
4458,Nino: Uncle?
4459,Jan: The commander is dead! That woman--
4460,Sonia: What were you going to say about me?
4461,Nino: Mother!
4462,Jan: Aaaah...Soniaaaa!!! Uwaa... Aaaaaaaa!!!!
4463,"Sonia: Wretch! I'll smoke you out later. First, Nino... You failed again, and you've tarnished my reputation."
4464,Nino: Um... Mother...
4465,Sonia: Shut up!!
4466,Nino: Ah!
4467,"Sonia: A thoroughly and utterly useless little girl. If only I'd known, I would've sent you off to your true parents!"
4468,Nino: My true...parents?
4469,"Sonia: Ha ha... That's right. What can the truth hurt now? Your true family for generations was the most famed house of magic wielders in all Lycia. They alone guarded the secret of the dragons. Thirteen years ago, Lord Nergal and I stole that secret."
4470,Nino: My...family?
4471,"Sonia: Ha ha ha! No matter how wise they were, they were only human. I held a child before me as a shield, and they were powerless to act!"
4472,Nino: ......
4473,"Sonia: The father, the mother, and then the child I carried... After they revealed all of their secrets... And I slaughtered them with these very hands!!"
4474,Nino: I... I... I'm not your daughter?
4475,"Sonia: There were two children, a boy and a girl. One, the mother fought fiercely to save. She held her daughter tight as I killed her. That girl, Nino, was you!"
4476,Nino: No!
4477,"Sonia: You were still a mewling little whelp, but we took you with us. Lord Nergal thought you might be useful, so he let you live. I hated the very thought of it, but it was Lord Nergal's wish that I raise you as my daughter."
4478,Nino: ......
4479,Sonia: We were so wrong about you! Stupid and useless beyond all reason! A worthless piece of offal! All you were was in the way!
4480,Nino: ...
4481,Jaffar: So that's why you wanted her dead. You're inhuman. Your soul is black and devoid of warmth.
4482,"Sonia: I never expected to hear such things from you, Jaffar! Once, you killed without hesitation at Lord Nergal's command. What happened to the man all feared, my Angel of Death?"
4483,"Jaffar: Nino has changed me. I am no longer Nergal's killing engine. For Nino's sake... Sonia, you must die. And I will kill you!"
4484,Nino: Jaffar!!
4485,Jaffar: Stay back. I will take care of this woman.
4486,"Sonia: Aha ha ha ha ha ha!!! ""Stay back""! How rich! How noble! So, shall I pass judgment on you, as the Black Fang must with traitors? Ha ha ha! I sentence you to death! Prepare to be punished!"
4487,???: I won't allow that!!
4488,Eliwood: Nino! Jaffar! Are you OK?
4489,Hector: Bah. Look at the trouble you've caused!
4490,Lyn: We're companions now. You mustn't forget that!
4491,Nino: Everyone...
4492,Jaffar: ......
4493,"Sonia: Ha ha ha ha ha! Such sweet friends, Nino... Sorry to cut short your little reunion. Ha ha... I won't let you get away. To a man, you will all die!"
4494,Lyn: Hm? Wha--!? Eeek!
4495,Eliwood: Lyndis! Look out!! This way!
4496,Jaffar: ...
4497,Sonia: Ha ha ha... You are the sinners who hurt my Lord Nergal. I will not let you die swiftly.
4498,Hector: Woah! This place is filling with water!!
4499,Eliwood: The path vanished... This water prevents us from moving forward or back.
4500,Lyn: Nino! Jaffar! Are you all right?
4501,Nino: Yeah! We're fine!!
4502,Jaffar: ......
4503,"Sonia: I'll create some paths for you, so please keep coming. Of course, you can stay where you are if you like. I care not, so long as you die in pain and fear. You can't escape from the grave that's waiting for you, though."
4504,"Nino: I'm sorry, everyone! All of this, it's... It's all...my..."
4505,"Lyn: Nino! Calm down. I told you, didn't I? We came because we're friends. There's no need to apologize."
4506,Nino: Lyn...
4507,"Hector: Pathways and courtesies? I guess she's being gracious, right?"
4508,Eliwood: Let's defeat Sonia and sever the connection between Nergal and the Black Fang!! For a better future!
4509,Sonia: Lord Nergal will have your quintessence! Only the chosen few will live to see the new world. Perfect people! People like me!
4510,Nino: I thought for so long that you were my true mother…
4511,"Sonia: Ha ha ha! Your mother and father looked so much like you. They were so naive it made me want to vomit. I dressed in rags and entered their house with a child in my arms. They were sincerely concerned. Ha ha… Trusting a stranger is so utterly foolish. Oh, they came to regret their trust, but it was too late."
4512,Nino: Aaahhh!!! You’re no perfect being! You’re a monster in human form! No mercy! No forgiveness!!!
4513,Jaffar: Here I come.
4514,"Sonia: Ingrate! You owe your life to Lord Nergal! You and that girl, you’re nothing but filth! But it matters not, as long as your essence remains intact. No other part of you now has any value."
4515,Sonia: It can't be... I'm...perfect... Lord Nergal said...so...
4516,Jan: Dear little Nino.
4517,Nino: Uncle Jan! I'm so glad you're safe!!
4518,"Jan: Yes. I didn't even fight. I just hid... I... I... I'm just a cowardly old man... When that woman killed the commander, I could do nothing..."
4519,"Nino: Father... He's dead, isn't he?... Even though I wasn't his real daughter, he treated me kindly. and yet...Moth--Sonia......"
4520,Jan: ......You learned the truth?
4521,Nino: Uh-huh.
4522,"Jan: I see... Let me return this to you, lass."
4523,Nino: A...pendant?
4524,"Jan: It belonged to your real mother. The commander never fully trusted Sonia. He had his agents investigate her past. He uncovered much... Like where you'd come from. He was able to speak to a woman who worked in your house. When he told her about you, she wept with joy. She asked that you be given this."
4525,"Nino: ......I loved the Black Fang. Nergal and Sonia have ruined it, but... The Black Fang that my father and brothers made... Everyone was so kind, I thought of them as my family..."
4526,Jan: Mmm...mmm. That was a good time.
4527,"Nino: Uncle Jan... Thank you. The pendant, I'll cherish it."
4528,"Jan: Take care, lass. ...Be happy."
4529,"Nino: Goodbye, Uncle. See you again. Someday..."
4530,Lyn: Have you said your farewells?
4531,Nino: Yes. Uh...thanks. you all came and... told me that we're friends. ......It made me happy. Can I travel with you?
4532,"Lyn: Of course! Right, Eliwood?"
4533,"Eliwood: If that's what you'd like, we'd be happy to have you. Will you come and help us?"
4534,"Nino: Yeah! I'll do my best! I promise! Jaffar, too!"
4535,Jaffar: ......
4536,Hector: We should be getting back to camp. We've an early start tomorrow.
4537,Eliwood: You're right. We should head out as soon as it's light. The Shrine of Seals awaits!
4538,Limstella: Sonia.
4539,Sonia: ......Lea--Leave me... ...accursed puppet... Lord Nergal... ...Aah...help...me.
4540,Limstella: Puppets have no essence to harvest. You no longer have any use to Lord Nergal...
4541,Sonia: What!? ...What...did... What are you...I am human......
4542,Limstella: ......
4543,Sonia: Wait! ...Urrg!! ...I...am... ...hu...ma...... ......
4544,"After receiving aid from Queen Hellene, Eliwood/Hector rushes to the sealed shrine. The secret road they follow is known only to the royal family… They pass Bern's soldiers unnoticed and unhindered. They approach the castle…
"
4545,"Linus: Wait for the opportunity, and bring them down... That's the way, right, Brother? And now the time has finally arrived."
4546,"Black Fang: Lord Linus, the enemy draws near."
4547,"Linus: At last! Everyone, scatter! This fight will be Lloyd's wake! Let none of them escape!"
4548,Second Black Fang: Sir!
4549,Eliwood: I can see it... That's the Shrine of Seals.
4550,Hector: This is strange. We've made it so far without seeing a single soul.
4551,Lyn: I'm afraid that's no longer the case.
4552,Hector: What!?
4553,Eliwood: They're out for blood! Who could they be?
4554,"Black Fang: You're Lord Eliwood of House Pherae, correct?"
4555,Eliwood: ...And if I am?
4556,"Black Fang: We are the Fang, and we serve the Mad Dog, Linus. You will atone for your sins with blood!!"
4557,Eliwood: What!?
4558,Nino: It's the The Black Fang... They're all Fangs. They're alive!
4559,Jaffar: Wait!
4560,Nino: What? What is it?
4561,"Jaffar: Their battle lust... It's not normal. Get too close, and they'll tear you apart!"
4562,"Nino: Why? Why do we have to fight? If we talk to them, they'll see."
4563,"Jaffar: We are no longer Fangs. No... We served Nergal. We were never Fangs. To them, we were never companions. Never."
4564,Nino: No... No... That's not true! That man mentioned Linus! Linus must be here! I need to talk to him! Linus will understand! I won't give up so easily!!
4565,Jaffar: ......
4566,"Lloyd: I've been waiting. And now, at last, the time to bring you down is here. The Fangs let none escape."
4567,"Black Fang: Lord Lloyd, the enemy draws near."
4568,"Lloyd: So they're finally here... Our opponents are strong. If anyone here is afraid to die, leave now."
4569,Black Fang: For the Reed brothers' Fang must not fear dying.
4570,Second Black Fang: We are all with you. Lord Lloyd! Do us the honor of leading us 'til the end!
4571,"Lloyd: I shall. In the name of the Fang, we will stop them though it cost our very lives. Go!"
4572,Eliwood: I can see it... That's the Shrine of Seals.
4573,Hector: This is strange. We've made it so far without seeing a single soul.
4574,Lyn: I'm afraid that's no longer the case.
4575,Hector: What!?
4576,Eliwood: They're out for blood! Who could they be?
4577,"Black Fang: You're Lord Eliwood of House Pherae, correct?"
4578,Eliwood: ...And if I am?
4579,"Black Fang: We are the Fang, and we serve the White Wolf, Lloyd. You will atone for your sins with blood!!"
4580,Eliwood: What!?
4581,Nino: It's the The Black Fang... They're all Fangs. They're alive!
4582,Jaffar: Wait!
4583,Nino: What? What is it?
4584,"Jaffar: Their battle lust... It's not normal. Get too close, and they'll tear you apart!"
4585,"Nino: Why? Why do we have to fight? If we talk to them, they'll see."
4586,"Jaffar: We are no longer Fangs. No... We served Nergal. We were never Fangs. To them, we were never companions. Never."
4587,Nino: No... No... That's not true! That man mentioned Lloyd! Lloyd must be here! I need to talk to him! Lloyd will understand! I won't give up so easily!!
4588,Jaffar: ......
4589,"Nino: Mark! Let me go! I can talk to my brother! I know it might not work, but..."
4590,"Jaffar: Do you need something, Mark? That's right. They're Black Fang. The man he named, like me, is one of the Four Fangs. He is an assassin, my equal... Or better... ....."
4591,"Linus: You’re Eliwood, right?! I’ve been looking for you!"
4592,Eliwood: Hey!! Hold on! We need to talk about things…
4593,"Linus: I am Linus Reed, son of Brendan Reed. I am the vengeance of Lloyd, whose life you stole! Prepare yourself! I’m coming for you!!!"
4594,Eliwood: Wait!!!
4595,"Linus: Hey, you! You think you’re tough, don’t you?"
4596,Hector: Tough enough to cleave you in two.
4597,"Linus: I am Linus Reed, son of Brendan Reed. You killed my brother, Lloyd! Take this! Rrraahh!!!"
4598,"Hector: I am Marquess Ostia’s brother, Hector!! And I don’t know about Lloyd, but I’ll sure kill you!"
4599,Nino: Linus! Stop!! Please listen to me!!
4600,"Linus: I will kill anyone who aids my brother’s killers! Nino, that includes you!!!"
4601,Nino: No!! …My…brother…
4602,Linus: Jaffar!! You traitorous scum!
4603,Jaffar: ……
4604,"Linus: Repent your sins, Jaffar! I bring you the Fang’s justice!"
4605,Legault: Hello… Linus.
4606,Linus: Legault!? You… You disloyal filth! You of all people…siding with them!?
4607,Legault: Calm down. Your brother’s murder… It wasn’t by our hands… Hey!!
4608,Linus: Draw your sword. I won’t miss again.
4609,"Legault: Remember how good the old days were? Your father, old Jan, Uhai, you, and me and your brother. When did the Black Fang lose its honor?"
4610,Linus: Be quiet!!! Stop your pathetic whimpering and fight!!
4611,"Legault: I knew this would happen. Nothing’s going to change. I knew it, and yet here I am. I couldn’t leave well enough alone… I’m a fool."
4612,Linus: ...Wha...I've lost...At least...I can see my brother again.
4613,"Lloyd: We meet at last, Eliwood."
4614,Eliwood: Ah! Hold on! Let’s talk! We…
4615,"Lloyd: I’m Lloyd Reed, son of Brendan Reed. My brother, Linus, whom you killed, longs for you to join him…….Prepare to die."
4616,Eliwood: Wait!!!
4617,"Lloyd: You there, who are you?"
4618,"Hector: Marquess Ostia’s brother, Hector! And you, lout?"
4619,"Lloyd: The Black Fang commander’s son, Lloyd Reed… You remind me of my brother. Something about you…"
4620,Hector: Huh? What are you talking about?
4621,"Lloyd: My brother, whom you killed. My brother, Linus….It’s none of your business……"
4622,"Hector: I have a brother, too. If someone killed him, I would make sure his killer paid dearly and suffered long…"
4623,"Lloyd: ……Well spoken. If you don’t want to give your brother cause to mourn, you’d best fight well…….Prepare yourself."
4624,Hector: Ah!!
4625,Nino: Lloyd!
4626,Lloyd: Nino…
4627,"Nino: Listen to me, please. This is all a mistake…"
4628,Lloyd: Do not speak. We are enemies now… I can show you no mercy.
4629,Nino: Lord Eliwood is not a bad man! You’ll fight knowing that?
4630,Lloyd: They were Linus’s enemies… That is why I fight.
4631,"Nino: Lloyd, please…"
4632,"Lloyd: Don’t cry, Nino. You must live for the future. I am bound to this course. Kill me, and don’t look back."
4633,Nino: No! I don’t want to! Lloyd!!!
4634,"Lloyd: The “Angel of Death."" Since the day I met you, I’ve always wondered… If we met in straight combat, who of us would win?"
4635,Jaffar: ……
4636,Lloyd: I think it’s time that question was answered.
4637,"Legault: Hey… Long time, no see."
4638,"Lloyd: The Hurricane… I heard you’d quit the Fang, but… Seeing you with them is…"
4639,"Legault: Unexpected? Shouldn’t be. As soon as that skulking shadow Nergal showed up, I knew the Fang was as good as finished."
4640,Lloyd: ...…
4641,"Legault: You know… You’re the one thing I can’t figure out. Lloyd, what are you doing here? Why this?"
4642,Lloyd: Who knows… But my brother’s dead. And at the hands of your newfound friends…
4643,Legault: We’re not responsible for Linus’s death.
4644,"Lloyd: It does not matter. I believe you are, and that is enough."
4645,"Legault: ……All right. I see. Nothing’s going to change. I knew that, and yet… I had to try. It’s a bad habit of mine."
4646,"Lloyd: Farewell, Legault. My old friend."
4647,"Legault: I’ll see you again, Lloyd. With Linus…and Uhai… Even if it won’t be in this world."
4648,"Lloyd: ......No more waiting, Linus. I'm...coming..."
4649,Nino: ...Brother... ... ... ...
4650,Jaffar: ......
4651,Nino: ...Why? Why did it...have to...come to this...? I... I don't understand. ... ... ... ...
4652,"Hector: ...You were a strong man. Under different circumstances, I think we'd......"
4653,Athos: Do you regret the outcome of your actions?
4654,"Hector: ...Graybeard. He only wanted to avenge his brother. I can't... ...Maybe it's regret... I'll carry it with me forever. When I'm alone and dying, what will I be thinking of?"
4655,Athos: You're a powerful man. I doubt such power will let you live a life of peace. Yet you should not fear. For perhaps that is the path of your life.
4656,Hector: ...The path of my life...
4657,Lyn: Lord Athos? When did you arrive?
4658,"Athos: Just now... I warped in, you know? I was watching you in my scrying crystal. The most important thing is that you've made it here."
4659,"Hector: If that's true, why didn't you just magic us here in the first place?!"
4660,"Athos: What would that have proven? You cannot hope to succeed if you cannot trust your own strength. Your own power must drive you. That is the most important thing. Now then, shall we go? Underground... Where Bramimond awaits."
4661,Eliwood: Bramimond? One of the eight legends? Is that who you're talking about?
4662,"Athos: That's right. Of the eight legends, only Bramimond and myself remain. Your journey here was a bit of a test, I'm afraid. I had to see if you were worthy of wielding a legendary item."
4663,Eliwood: Legendary...item?
4664,"Athos: That's right. It's a weapon that we, the eight legends, used to defeat the dragons. With it, you will be able to sever Nergal's power at its roots."
4665,Eliwood: A weapon to defeat Nergal...
4666,Athos: The legendary items are sealed in lands across this continent. The only one capable of removing those seals is Bramimond. Now if only we will be granted this one request.
4667,Eliwood: It's so dark...
4668,Hector: It's creepy... Can't see a thing.
4669,Lyn: Shh! ...Someone's here.
4670,Eliwood: You're Bramimond...
4671,"Bramimond: ...Yes, I...suppose that is me. What do you want of me, you who live above ground?"
4672,Lyn: We have a favor to ask. We seek something to help us defeat Nergal...
4673,"Bramimond: That is unfortunate, for I cannot grant that which you seek. Humanity would suffer were I to remove the seals."
4674,Hector: What do you mean!? The entire world is on the brink of destruction as it is!!
4675,Bramimond: The entire world!? Why would I care about that!? The whole world can burn for all I care!!
4676,Hector: By Father Sky... Your voice... The way you talk. It keeps changing. How many...
4677,"Athos: Bramimond has no self. He... She... It... Yes, it is a mirror that reflects the person addressing it. It projects no personality of its own. There are as many Bramimonds as there are people facing him. ...Bramimond, do you remember me?"
4678,"Bramimond: ...Athos. Hmm, it's been many ages. I cannot fathom why you brought these people here. Why I sealed everything away... Do you forget why? The legendary items are not meant for human hands."
4679,Eliwood: But...we can't stop Nergal like this! We need your power to help us save the world!
4680,Bramimond: .......
4681,"Athos: Bramimond, remember... We, too, are human. These people, they will not be seduced by power. They came here without my aid, using their own abilities. You observed them, did you not?"
4682,"Bramimond: ...It's true... They seem better, stronger than most humans. And yet, humans are frail. What guarantee do I have... that they will not succumb to that frailty, Athos?!"
4683,Eliwood: A guarantee? There is none. We simply ask that you believe in us.
4684,Bramimond: ...... ...Once... There was a man much like you. His gaze never wandered. It was ever fixed straight ahead... ...... ...........
4685,Bramimond: ...The seals have been released. You may now do as you please. I'm tired. You will let me rest.
4686,Hector: Ah! It's good to breathe the outside air again!
4687,Lyn: Bramimond is certainly a mysterious figure.
4688,Eliwood: Mm... I wonder what convinced him to release the seals.
4689,"Athos: Interesting that... I believe it was darkness. A completely impenetrable darkness, the nature of which is beyond the comprehension of normal men. Regardless, you must hurry. The seals have been broken. Nergal has surely sensed this already... You must get to the blazing blade as soon as possible..."
4690,???: How unfortunate... You're too late.
4691,Eliwood: Ah!
4692,Eliwood: Nergal!
4693,"Nergal: At last... At last, my power is restored. Come, Ninian, Nils. This way. Open the Dragon's Gate for me."
4694,Nils: ...N-No!
4695,Ninian: ......
4696,Eliwood: You mustn't go! Neither of you!!
4697,"Nergal: Would you like to see my powers here and now? You may choose, Ninian. Obey me, or..."
4698,"Ninian: ...If I go with you, will you let my brother go?"
4699,Nils: Ninian!?
4700,Nergal: One of you should prove sufficient. ......As you wish.
4701,Nils: No! Ninian! Why!?
4702,Ninian: ...Look after Lord Eliwood...
4703,Nils: Ninian!
4704,Eliwood: Ninian! You must not!
4705,Ninian: ......
4706,"Nergal: The gate will open, and I will gain unlimited power."
4707,Nils: Niniaaaaaaaan!!!
4708,Eliwood: Don't move! Nergal!!!
4709,Athos: No! Get down! Both of you!!
4710,"Hector: Are you awake, Eliwood?"
4711,Eliwood: Where...
4712,Hector: Camp. You and Nils were both knocked unconscious by Nergal's parting gift. Do you remember?
4713,Eliwood: His power... It's so much more than before.
4714,Lyn: If Lord Athos hadn't erected a barrier when he did... We would have lost both you and Nils......
4715,"Athos: If he'd truly wished to kill you, even my power could not have saved you."
4716,"Eliwood: Ninian... To protect us, she..."
4717,"Athos: Even if you catch him, you can't defeat him. Not as you are. If you wish to save the girl Ninian... The power to topple Nergal lies within the sacred weapon. Do you understand, Eliwood?"
4718,"Eliwood: ...Yes, I know what I must do."
4719,"Athos: You must go to Ostia and take possession of Roland's blade. But before you go... take this, Eliwood."
4720,Eliwood: This is... It's a...
4721,"Athos: That's right, it's a Heaven Seal."
4722,"Eliwood: I'm sorry, Lord Athos. These seals... They do not find me worthy."
4723,"Athos: Trust me. Take it, and hold it in your hands."
4724,Eliwood: Very well. ...........! ...It's......!!
4725,Eliwood: Lord Athos!
4726,Athos: Hm. As I thought. It finds you suitable.
4727,Eliwood: ...This is incredible. My body is overflowing with power.
4728,"Hector: Way to go, Eliwood!!"
4729,Eliwood: Let's go. We have to get that weapon. We will defeat Nergal and rescue Ninian!!
4730,"A mountain cave on the outskirts of Ostia. Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting, the seal guarding it broken. However, to retrieve the weapon, one must pass a trial. A long, seemingly uncrossable distance... Eliwood must overcome the challenge with the help of his friends. Eliwood's true strength will soon be sorely tested.
"
4731,"Nergal: Ah, sweet Ninian. This time, you will open the gate."
4732,Ninian: ......
4733,"Nergal: So you intend to resist me to the end? You only joined me to postpone your own friends' deaths, did you? You never had any intention of offering your aid freely?"
4734,Ninian: ......
4735,"Nergal: ...Heh heh heh... Whether you wish it or not, it is all the same to me. I will call forth a dragon and claims its quintessence. I will harness a power never before seen on this world. And I will become this world's master. That is my desire. Ninian, you are but a tool to help me achieve that end."
4736,Ninian: ...I don't want to help you. I... I don't want to do it.
4737,"Nergal: Don't want to? You are truly amusing. My dear, I am not looking for your consent. You are weak, and I am strong. You will bend before me."
4738,Ninian: No...
4739,"Nergal: It's the same as when I sacrificed Eliwood's father. With enough energy, I do not need your acquiescence. Come, Ninian. Open the gate!"
4740,Ninian: No...no... No... Nooooooooo!
4741,"Nergal: So, at least... Your true form... is liberated. Hmph. To where do you hope to run, beast? You'll never be human. Why do you cling to them so? What would Eliwood say if he saw your hideous form? Ninian, for one such as you, there will never be a place you can call your home!"
4742,Eliwood: ...I never imagined there could be a place like this in Lycia...
4743,Lyn: The air is so hot. It even hurts to breathe.
4744,Hector: Look down there. There's lava everywhere. Hey! Next to the path... Are those columns of flame?!
4745,"Athos: Long ago, in the depths of this cavern... When Lycia was a single country, an altar was built."
4746,Eliwood: Here? In this place?
4747,Athos: There's something here that needs protection from those with evil hearts.
4748,"Eliwood: Durandal, right?"
4749,"Athos: That's correct. The weapons we wielded contained great strength. Power fearsome enough to cut down dragons... Today, the might in those remaining weapons is not what it once was. Yet they have been safeguarded to keep them from evil hands. This place... No one's stepped foot in here since Roland's death. Roland's presence still fills the air. All that reside here now are former soldiers who guard the sword. This is your trial, Eliwood. A few of you may enter, but only you can approach the altar. Go and prove that you have the strength to wield Durandal!"
4750,"Hector: Listen, Mark. You know how Eliwood is. Never wants to burden anyone else... Takes all responsibility on himself... Now, more than ever, we have to support him. Let's go, Mark!"
4751,"Eliwood: ...You have stood your guard for so, so long. I'm sorry..."
4752,Athos: Their souls may now rest. ...At long last...
4753,Eliwood: ...Mm.
4754,"Athos: Time for a reunion of sorts. Eliwood, move back."
4755,"Athos: My old friend... The little knight, Sir Roland."
4756,"Athos: Roland... Awaken, and answer my call."
4757,"Roland: ...My friend... Wise, all-seeing Athos..."
4758,"Athos: Good to see you, Roland."
4759,"Roland: I feel much time has passed. Seeing you again... It brings back memories. Fighting the dragons... Old friends... All this time, lost in memory..."
4760,"Athos: It's been almost a thousand years...and yet, once again, the world is threatened by one who craves the might of dragons."
4761,Roland: ...The might of dragons?
4762,"Athos: Heed my words, Roland. This boy is descended from your blood. Please, lend him your strength."
4763,"Roland: I...no longer have flesh and bone in this world. I cannot... No, wait. Take this. Its blade shall serve as a vessel for my soul's strength."
4764,"Athos: ...If you do such a thing, you will pass forever from the reach of this world."
4765,"Roland: And yet my heart will be glad. If I might help my children, there is nothing else I need do. ...I ask that you see this through, my friend..."
4766,Athos: I will...
4767,"Eliwood: Lord Athos, who was that man?"
4768,"Athos: So you were able to see him, too? That was your ancestor, the warrior Roland."
4769,Eliwood: That was Roland?
4770,Eliwood: Look! Above the altar! A sword...
4771,Athos: Take it! It belongs to you now.
4772,Eliwood: ...What a wondrous blade.
4773,Athos: Durandal. The sword of sacred fire.
4774,Hector: So this is the legendary blade...
4775,"Eliwood: Durandal, the sword of sacred fire."
4776,"Lyn: ...It's strange, isn't it? I've never seen it before, and yet it feels so familiar..."
4777,Eliwood: I will use this to battle Nergal. Come! To the Dragon's Gate... What!? The sword... It's glowing... Watch out! Something's coming...
4778,Eliwood: It can't be...
4779,Lyn: It's a...dragon!
4780,Hector: No!!! How is it possible!?
4781,"Eliwood: Get back, everyone!"
4782,Hector: Eliwood! Are you all right?
4783,Eliwood: I think so... My body moved on its own. It was as if the sword itself was guiding my arm.
4784,"Athos: The sword of sacred fire was made to combat dragons. With so much power, who can say what it might be capable of? But this ice dragon... Surely..."
4785,"Eliwood: Is something the matter, Lord Athos..."
4786,Athos: No...
4787,???: Let me be the one to answer that.
4788,Eliwood: Blackheart! Nergal!
4789,Nergal: Ninian proved useless. I've come for a replacement.
4790,Eliwood: Nils!
4791,Nergal: Don't waste your breath. He won't be awake for some time. Nils will do for me what Ninian would not.
4792,Eliwood: Scum! What have you done with Ninian!?
4793,"Nergal: It's not what I've done. It's what you've done, Eliwood."
4794,Eliwood: What?
4795,"Nergal: Eliwood, did you never once question it? Why the siblings were needed to open the Dragon's Gate? Why did it have to be Ninian and Nils?"
4796,Eliwood: ......
4797,Nergal: The answer is simple. The Dragon's Gate cannot be opened by humans. Why would humans be able to open a gate that was designed...for dragons?
4798,Eliwood: ...What?
4799,"Nergal: It's pitiful, really. Poor Ninian's plight. Coaxed by my honeyed words, she passed through the gate... Though unable to return home, she refused to aid me and wandered lost and alone, until...she was slain by the hand of the one she loved."
4800,Eliwood: What... What are you saying?
4801,"Nergal: Can you not guess? Or is it that you are afraid to know? Very well. Let me tell you, Eliwood. The ice dragon there... The beast slaughtered by your hand... That is Ninian. The girl who adored you. She returned to her true form and lost all human memory. Yet you, above all else, remained in her heart, and she came here... Look upon the creature you have slain. That is Ninian."
4802,Eliwood: ...Ah...
4803,"Nergal: Go on, look. She's using the last of her strength to take human form for one last time. I believe there may be still be time enough to say farewell. You know, of course, that you cannot save her."
4804,Eliwood: Nergal!! You foul demon !!
4805,"Nergal: It's not me. You, Eliwood. You killed her. You--"
4806,Eliwood: I... Aaaaaaahhh!!!
4807,"Hector: Calm down! Get hold of yourself, Eliwood."
4808,Eliwood: I... I......
4809,Ninian: Lo...Lord Eliwood...
4810,Eliwood: ...Ninian?
4811,Ninian: ...Ah...
4812,Eliwood: Ninian! Ninian!
4813,Ninian: Eliwood...
4814,Eliwood: Ninian... Please don't die... I... What have I done?
4815,Ninian: I'm glad...
4816,Eliwood: What?
4817,"Ninian: That you are unharmed, my lord... I'm so glad..."
4818,Eliwood: ...Ninian... Ninian? You can't... Answer me... Niniaaaaaaan!!!!
4819,Nergal: That's enough. You will await the end of the world trembling in the shadow of dragons!
4820,"Athos: I will not permit it. Instead, I will see you perish in flame!!"
4821,"Nergal: The purest fire... Flame breath. Very impressive, Archsage Athos. However... However, fire is no longer my foe! Look! Not even a legendary blade can cause me harm! At long last, I am impervious! Ha ha...ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"
4822,Athos: ...Gaa...
4823,"Nergal: Miserable, aren't you, Athos? Yet out of respect for the great man you used to be, I'll leave. After all, 500 years ago, we followed the same path, did we not, old friend? Ha ha ha ha ha!!"
4824,Hector: What do we do now? Not even legendary weapons can stop him!
4825,Nils: ...Unh... ...
4826,Lyn: Nils! You're awake! Are you OK?
4827,Nils: ...Ninian! ......Ninian. ...Ninian!? Where is my...
4828,Lyn: ...
4829,Hector: .......
4830,Eliwood: ...Nils... ...I'm so sorry.
4831,Nils: ...Uuh... Aaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
4832,"Ninian is dead. Now, only Nergal's echoing laughter remains… On Hector's advice, the group heads toward Ostia. They are weary to the bone, and they need time to regroup. Ostia is the most heavily guarded fortress city in all of Lycia. No enemy should have been able to breach its walls.
"
4833,"Vaida: Look at that! Bowmen as far as the eye can see! Mark! Do you have something against me? Heh, you know better than that. Let me tell you, Vaida is not your average wyvern rider! Mark! Sit back and watch me perform!"
4834,"Farina: Wow! Why do there have to be so many archers? Oh well... As long as I've been paid, I can't complain. This is my chance to show you what Farina of the Great Wing can do! But listen, Mark... This goes beyond hazard pay!"
4835,"Eliwood: We've received word from Captain Fargus. If we come to Badon, he'll give us passage to the Dread Isle."
4836,"Lyn: Well then, let's get going!"
4837,Marcus: It would be best if we outfitted ourselves before setting out. We will need many supplies for a campaign on Valor.
4838,"Hector: And the castle town here is better stocked than Badon, I'm sure. We can empty the coffers here and sell the treasures if need be."
4839,Oswin: Harrummph!!
4840,"Hector: ...Uh... Within limits, of course. Say...30,000 gold?"
4841,Oswin: That seems a reasonable amount.
4842,Hector: Come on! I'll lead the way!
4843,Marcus: Ostia's castle town is as impressive as ever. Shops and items of all types imaginable.
4844,"Hector: For generations, our ancestors dedicated themselves to a sort of frugal militarism. Nobles and commoners alike shunned extravagance. ""Corrupt neither the body nor the mind,"" they cried! Since the time of Roland, this has been the dominant ideology of Ostia."
4845,"Marcus: I heard that when Lord Uther first participated in the Lycian Council as Marquess Ostia, he gave a scathing indictment of the peer system. Now I understand, his philosophy had its roots in the history of Ostia itself."
4846,"Hector: That's right. Yet this thinking... it threatens the lifestyles of many of our aristocrats. So some groups view my brother with enmity. I must grow wiser so that I can sit at my brother's side and aid him. Of course, my fighting skills are not yet what they should be..."
4847,Lyn: ......
4848,Eliwood: ......
4849,Hector: But this isn't the place for that kind of talk. We've got to get going. Come on!
4850,"Marcus: Yes, I will go with you."
4851,Lyn: ...Curious.
4852,"Eliwood: What is it, Lyndis?"
4853,"Lyn: Hector. He acts like such a brute, but he takes his duties seriously."
4854,Eliwood: Hector has always been a man of firm character. I've always envied him for that. His ability to conceal any doubts he feels about himself or his actions.
4855,"Lyn: Eliwood, you're more than strong enough yourself."
4856,Eliwood: Hm?
4857,"Lyn: Look at all that's happened in the past few months. Especially for you, Eliwood. One horrible thing after another..."
4858,Eliwood: ......
4859,"Lyn: Yet you're still here. You didn't run away. Through all the battles and injuries... you've held your head high and marched on. Your... Your strength, I admire. Your kindness...I adore."
4860,Eliwood: Lyndis...
4861, ???: Hey! What are you two doing? Let's go! Both of you!
4862,Lyn: Well... I guess we should go.
4863,"Eliwood: Uh, Lyndis..."
4864,"Hector: Eliwood, what are you yammering about? Huh? Are you feeling OK? You're all flushed."
4865,"Soldier: Lord Hector! I have brought the 30,000 gold that was requested from the treasury!"
4866,"Bartre: Will you look at that! It's an arena! That is a battleground for men to test their strength! Come on, Mark! We can fight to our heart's content!!"
4867,Eliwood: ...That should cover it. Let's head out for Badon. Then to the Dread Isle!!
4868,"Limstella: Welcome home, Master."
4869,"Nergal: Limstella, look at this."
4870,Limstella: The children's dragon stone. What will you do with it?
4871,Nergal: I will infuse it with quintessence.
4872,Limstella: This is...
4873,"Nergal: The dragon girl... Ninian's essence. Beautiful... Absolutely beautiful....... With this, I will be able to call dragons whenever I please."
4874,Limstella: Shall we begin the process right away?
4875,"Nergal: No, I lost some quintessence from the injuries I took from Athos. To summon the numbers I need, I must have more essence. One must be fully prepared when dealing with dragons. If they wrested free from my control and killed me, all would be for naught."
4876,Limstella: I fear to report... that the quintessence from the Black Fang has all been used. Where shall the next harvest come from?
4877,Nergal: Heh heh heh... All the materials we need are heading this way even now.
4878,Limstella: ...I see. Eliwood and friends.
4879,"Nergal: That's right. I will crush them, steal their essences, and call forth my dragons!! Heh heh heh... Haaa haa haha haha hah!!!"
4880,"Nils: Ah, Lord Eliwood! Here..."
4881,Eliwood: This is... an Earth Seal! Where did you get this?
4882,Nils: Fargus told me to give it to you.
4883,Eliwood: I'm grateful. This should help us out in battle!
4884,"Nils: Mark... If you're worried about me, I'm fine. You know all about my flute song, right, Mark? I'll do my best to do Ninian's part, too!"
4885,"Karla: You are Mark... This army's general, right? What? A tactician? Well, either way, don't be shy. If you need work done, use me. I do not enjoy battle, but I have my skills."
4886,Limstella: I will take your life and your essence. All for the sake of my master.
4887,"Limstella: I am not human. This body and this heart are constructs. Yet, as is this sorrow."
4888,Eliwood: That was a heated battle.
4889,Hector: I thought it was going to go on forever... Phew...
4890,Lyn: It's not finished yet. Nergal is waiting at the Dragon's Gate!
4891,Nils: Nergal. He must pay!!
4892,"Eliwood: Before we go to the Dragon's Gate... Nils, if you don't mind, would you share your story with us?"
4893,Nils: Huh?
4894,Eliwood: I won't force you to if you don't want to.
4895,"Nils: ......OK, I'll tell you. I want you all to know about me and Ninian. A millennium ago... Man chased dragonkind from the land, exiled us. We had no place to go... not on this world. So we used the Dragon's Gate to flee into another world. When we passed through this chasm in space and time, many of us were lost. Still, we endured the journey. We found humans there, too, but they were few in number. We had a few skirmishes, but at last, we found a home. We were stable there, happy, even. But some thought back on our former home, and when we did, his voice reached out to us. Ninian was a medium in the other world, an oracle of sorts. She sat at the Dragon Shrine. She held much power. We were in prayer at the shrine when it happened... We heard a voice calling to us from the Dragon's Gate. It was the voice of an old friend... We knew we weren't supposed to open the gate and return to this world. We had no idea that the owner of that voice was Nergal..."
4896,Eliwood: Nergal...
4897,"Nils: But something unexpected happened. When we opened the Dragon's Gate and traveled her again, we had lost almost all of our strength... The quintessence left within us was less even than that of an average human. In order to sustain ourselves, in order to breathe the air of this world, we took human form. We placed our energies within a dragonstone. But our dragonstone was taken...stolen. Nergal hoped to use it as a tool to summon other dragons. ...Until we escaped. We couldn't let our foolishness condemn our friends. Disguised as a dancer and a bard, we fled and wandered from country to country. That's when we first met Lady Lyndis, one year ago."
4898,Lyn: That whole time... Nergal was after you? Why didn't you tell me?
4899,"Nils: You were so good to us. We didn't want to cause you any trouble. After we left Lyn at Caelin, we were captured again... ...We decided that the only way to escape was to cut short our own lives. That was when we met Lord Elbert. He was so strong, so kind... He knew what we were...and what we had done, and he never once condemned us. On the contrary, he tried to set us at ease with stories... Stories of his family, of his homeland. Ninian and I... We listened to his stories, and we grew to love his gentle wife and his son. Premonition... No, that is too strong a word, but we felt his son would be the one to save us. ...That's what we felt. That's why... That's why, Lord Eliwood!"
4900,Eliwood: ......
4901,"Nils: I believe in you. Even though Ninian's gone, I will continue to protect you. I have to. That... That's Ninian's wish. It's our wish. Let's stop Nergal! You're the only one who can do it......"
4902,Eliwood: Nils!
4903,Hector: Let's do it! Eliwood!!
4904,"Lyn: He's right! It's too early to give up! I mean, we're still here! We're still alive!!"
4905,Eliwood: Everyone... You're right. My friends are here with me! There's no power on this earth stronger than that! Let's go! The Dragon's Gate awaits!! That's where we'll shatter Nergal's ambitions!!
4906,"To the west of Elibe lies an archipelago known as the Western Isles. Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting, the seal guarding it broken. However, to retrieve the weapon, one must pass a trial. Armads, a sacred axe filled with the destructive force of thunder. To wield it, one must prove one's worth. Hector faces a test unlike any he's ever experienced.
"
4907,"Hector: Hey, it's pitch black in here! Agh, and it's full of smoke... Hey, Graybeard Athos, you sure this is the right place?"
4908,"Athos: Yes. Armads, the legendary weapon of Durban the Berserker, who took its name as his own. Armads is here."
4909,"Hector: If I've got that, I can help out Eliwood, can't I?"
4910,"Athos: This battle axe is so tremendous that normal men cannot even lift it. However, it's possible that you might be strong enough."
4911,"Hector: C'mon, let's go. I want to get my hands on it!"
4912,"Athos: Slow down, you fool! The spirits of the soldiers who once fought at our side against the dragons now guard the legendary weapon even in death."
4913,"Hector: ...and if I can get through them, I can take the axe, right?"
4914,Athos: There are more of them than I'd imagined. You can't do this alone. You must have help.
4915,"Hector: Fine with me, but how many people can come with me?"
4916,Athos: Too many will simply serve to excite the guardians. Call as few allies as possible.
4917,"Hector: Bah... I don't get it, but I'll do as you say."
4918,"Athos: ...Be on guard, Hector. Every act of strength you perform has consequences..."
4919,"Hector: Don't worry. I'll get that axe! Now if we're calling allies, let's call them and get moving!"
4920,"Athos: Hmph... You are a bold one. That is your strength, but also your weakness. Your recklessness may one day be your undoing..."
4921,"Eliwood: Mark... I'm sure you already know, Hector's as strong as they come. But... I'm worried. I've known him since we were kids, and... you've probably seen it, too. The weakness hidden within the heart is his strength. Mark, we have to protect Hector. I'm sure he'll stomp and yell about it, but ...we're friends. Let's go, Mark!"
4922,Kaim: I am Kaim. You who search for power... You...must prove your worth to me...
4923,Kaim: Tremendous...strength... Truly...like...his...
4924,Kaim: …Seal… ….. could not… …prote…ct…Such re…gret…..
4925,Hector: All right! This is the throne. Athos Graybeard! I made it!
4926,???: ...Let...
4927,Hector: What was...
4928,???: ...Let me fight... Me... Let me fight...
4929,Hector: Wha-What are you supposed to be?
4930,???: My name is... Durban... I am called... Armads...
4931,Hector: What is going on here?
4932,"Durban: I am power. Power without peer. I am the dragonhunter. I am the fleshbiter, the bonecrusher, the skullbreaker, the doombringer."
4933,Hector: ......
4934,Durban: I require no seals. I have no need of this idleness called peace. Power unused is power wasted. Better to lie spent in the grave than to sit in wait. I care not who... I would fight someone...
4935,"Hector: This is one dangerous-looking fellow... Hey, Durban... I mean, Armads... Whatever. Doesn't matter. Hey, you, lend me your strength!"
4936,Durban: You desire strength? Then prepare yourself. Once you have gained such power... Your life will not end in a comfortable bed. You will die on the battlefield. In the savage garden of war's bloody delights.
4937,Hector: ...I don't care. I will help my friend. That's why I've come this far. Armads! Your power! Lend it to me.
4938,Durban: ...It is yours.
4939,Eliwood: Hector!
4940,Lyn: What have you been doing? I'm glad to see that you're well...
4941,"Hector: Hey, I told you not to worry. Here, look at this. It's the thunder hammer."
4942,"Athos: So, you have acquired Armads, have you, Hector?"
4943,"Hector: Yep. Okay Eliwood, now it's your turn."
4944,"Eliwood: Mm, let's go!"
4945,"Athos: We will not leave Eliwood to his task, and wait outside."
4946,Lyn: I wonder if Eliwood is all right.
4947,Hector: He is. No need to worry about Eliwood.
4948,Lyn: You're right.
4949,Hector: Aha! Look! He's coming out!
4950,Hector: So this is the legendary blade...
4951,"Lyn: Durandal, the sword of sacred fire. ...It's strange, isn't it? I've never seen it before, but it feels so familiar..."
4952,Eliwood: I will use this to battle Nergal. Come! To the Dragon's Gate... What?!
4953,Eliwood: It can't be...
4954,Lyn: That's a...dragon!
4955,Hector: No!!! How is it possible!?
4956,"Eliwood: Get back, everyone!"
4957,Hector: Eliwood! Are you all right?
4958,Eliwood: I think so... My body moved on its own. It was as if the blade itself were guiding my arm.
4959,"Athos: The sword of sacred fire was made to combat dragons. With so much power, who can say what it is capable of? But this ice dragon... Surely..."
4960,"Eliwood: Is something the matter, Lord Athos..."
4961,Athos: No...
4962,???: Let me be the one to answer that.
4963,Eliwood: Blackheart! Nergal!
4964,Nergal: Ninian proved useless. I've come for a replacement.
4965,Eliwood: Nils!
4966,Nergal: Don't waste your breath. He won't be awake for some time. Nils will do for me what Ninian would not.
4967,Eliwood: Scum! What have you done with Ninian!?
4968,"Nergal: It's not what I've done. It's what you've done, Eliwood."
4969,Eliwood: What?
4970,"Nergal: Eliwood, did you never once question it? Why the siblings were needed to open the Dragon's Gate? Why did it have to be Ninian and Nils?"
4971,Eliwood: ......
4972,Nergal: The answer is simple. The Dragon's Gate cannot be opened by humans. Why would humans be able to open a gate that was designed... for dragons?
4973,Eliwood: ...What?
4974,"Nergal: It pitiful, really. Poor Ninian's plight. Coaxed by my honeyed words, she passed through the gate... Though unable to return home, she refused to aid me and wandered lost and alone, until... she was slain by the hand of the one she loved."
4975,Eliwood: What... What are you saying?
4976,"Nergal: Can you not guess? Or is it that you are afraid to know? Very well. Let me tell you, Eliwood. The ice dragon there... The beast slaughtered by your hand... That is Ninian. The girl who adored you. She returned to her true form, and lost all human memory. yet you, above all else, remained in her heart, and she came here... Look upon the creature you have slain. That is Ninian."
4977,Eliwood: ...Ah...
4978,"Nergal: Go on, look. She's using the last of her strength to take human form for one last time. I believe there may still be time enough to say farewell. You know, of course, that you cannot save her."
4979,Eliwood: Nergal!!! You foul demon!!!
4980,"Nergal: It's not me. You, Eliwood. You killed her. You--"
4981,Eliwood: I... Aaaaaaahh!!!
4982,"Hector: Calm down! Get a hold of yourself, Eliwood."
4983,Eliwood: I... I......
4984,Ninian: Lo...Lord Eliwood...
4985,Eliwood: ...Ninian?
4986,Ninian: ...Ah...
4987,Eliwood: Ninian! Ninian!
4988,Ninian: Eliwood...
4989,Eliwood: Ninian... Please don't die... I... What have I done?
4990,Ninian: I'm glad...
4991,Eliwood: What?
4992,"Ninian: That you are unharmed, my lord... I'm so glad..."
4993,Eliwood: ...Ninian... Ninian? You can't... Answer me...
4994,Eliwood: Niniaaaaaan!!!!
4995,Nergal: That's enough. You will await the end of the world trembling in the shadows of dragons!
4996,"Athos: I will not permit it. Instead, I will see you perish in flame!!"
4997,"Nergal: The purest fire... Flame breath. Very impressive, Archsage Athos. However... However, fire is no longer my foe! Look! Not even a legendary blade can cause me harm! At long last, I am impervious! Ha ha... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"
4998,Athos: ...Gaa...
4999,"Nergal: Miserable, aren't you, Athos? Yet out of respect for the great man you used to be, I'll leave. After all, 500 years ago, we followed the same path, did we not, old friend? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
5000,Hector: What do we do now? Not even legendary weapons can stop him!
5001, ???: ...Uh... ...
5002,Lyn: Nils! You're awake!
5003,Nils: ...Ninian! ......Ninian. ...Ninian!? Where is my...
5004,Lyn: ......
5005,Hector: .........
5006,Eliwood: ...Nils... I'm so sorry.
5007,Nils: ...Uuh...
5008,Nils: Aaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
5009,"Renault: You... Your name is, Mark, isn't it? I'll wager you don't trust me. You think I look shady, don't you? Don't let it bother you. It's the truth... Mark... Nergal is powerful. But he is still human, and these morphs were made by that same human... Victory is not impossible. ...I know this to be true."
5010,"One Year Later...
"
5011,"Note: This was removed in the European versions.
"
5012,Eliwood: ...Nergal should be back there. Should we wait for Lord Athos?
5013,"Athos: If you're looking for me, I'm right here."
5014,Eliwood: Lord Athos!
5015,"Hector: You're late, Graybeard!"
5016,Lyn: ...Well? Were you successful?
5017,Athos: I was. Use this magic tome.
5018,Eliwood: What is it?
5019,"Athos: A legendary item, Aureola. The strongest light magic, wielded by Saint Elimine herself. With this, we should be able to rend Nergal's dark cloak and do him much harm. And these, too, have been infused with magic that makes them more effective against Nergal. Durandal for Eliwood. And for Hector, Armads."
5020,Eliwood: It's... I can feel it already... Its power is beyond words.
5021,"Hector: Incredible! With this, I know I cannot fail."
5022,"Athos: ...And Lyndis, this is for you."
5023,Lyn: Hm? What blade is this?
5024,"Athos: A spirit-inhabited sword, the partner of the Mani Katti. This is the Sol Katti. It's not a legendary item, but its blade contains much power."
5025,Lyn: Thank you!
5026,"Athos: Nils, is Nergal back there?"
5027,Nils: Unn... I sense tremendous power. ...What could it be? I feel something really odd.
5028,"Athos: He should have lost most of his henchmen in that last battle. But.... Mm. I read energy, too... if only a little. Nils is right. The sense of it is different than before. Brace yourselves. He is...formidable!"
5029,"Eliwood: We understand. Let's go, everyone!"
5030,"Eliwood: Tactician, this is it. The last battle. Lord Athos spoke the truth about Nergal... Average men cannot hope to stand against him. Ordinary weapons hold no power against him. Those who go with us... They must be chosen carefully."
5031,Merlinus: Lord Eliwood... Lord Hector...
5032,Eliwood: Merlinus... Thank you for everything.
5033,Hector: You're made of sterner stuff than I'd imagined. Thought you'd've fled by now.
5034,Merlinus: ...Sniff sniff... I thought as much. You're not taking me with you...... ...Sniff ooh...
5035,"Hector: That's disgusting. Cry if you must, but do something about that runny nose. What are we supposed to do? You can't fight, so we can't afford to take you with us."
5036,Eliwood: Take this and return to Fargus's ship.
5037,"Merlinus: ...Wh-What is this, may I ask?"
5038,"Hector: A letter of introduction. Take this to Ostia, and you'll be able to do good business there. Of course, if we fail in our mission, it's just a worthless slip of paper."
5039,"Merlinus: But... ...I must protest!! For the rest of my days, I've vowed in my heart to continue serving you both! Please, oh please! Do not abandon me."
5040,Eliwood: Merlinus... ......
5041,Hector: Then go get on the boat and pray for our safe return!
5042,Eliwood: ...Please. Have faith in us. Wait for us.
5043,"Merlinus: ...Sniff sniff... ...I... I under...stand. Until the end of time, my lord. I will wait for you until the end of time. Please...come back... safely... Please!"
5044,"Hector: Yeah, OK. We're going. Bye."
5045,Eliwood: We'll be back.
5046,"Merlinus: ......Oh, Lord Eliwood... Oh my..."
5047,Eliwood: Nergal!
5048,Nergal: Pah...you're here. But you're too late. The gate is already opened. I will claim the mighty quintessence of dragons. I will become stronger and move ever closer to perfection.
5049,Eliwood: How many lives must you steal before you're satisfied!? And it's not only those who die. What about the ones left behind in pain and sorrow? What about them?
5050,"Nergal: I am who I am. The pain of others, I do not feel. The sorrow of others does not touch me. Death feeds me. Death pleases me. I am the essence I consume. You fools will become corpses here, because I wish it to be. Rise and come forth, my servants!"
5051,Eliwood: This...
5052,Nergal: You seem impressed with my work. Or perhaps it's just that you've seen a familiar face?
5053,"Eliwood: That's... Marquess Laus! And... Those are Black Fang members. What have you done, Nergal?!"
5054,"Nergal: These morphs you see before you, I've given them the abilities and appearances of the people whose essences I used to craft them. Well, that's not entirely true. I've made them far more powerful. This is the ideal plan for hypocrites like you. Especially you, Eliwood. You continue to regret causing harm to anyone, even enemies. However, no matter the reason, once the deed is done, it's done. Whether you enjoy it or not is irrelevant--the result is the same."
5055,Eliwood: It is not the same! If you feel no horror for taking someone's life... then you...you yourself are not alive!
5056,"Nergal: Heh heh heh... Your weakness runs deep in you. You can never understand. The concepts of good and evil are devoid of any meaning, any value. These ideas prevent humans from liberating their own strengths. Such foolishness... The ultimate foolishness of the human race!!"
5057,"Athos: Nergal, after all these years... You have not stopped to reconsider your ideas at all."
5058,"Nergal: The same is true of you, Athos. You must see the truth of it! All living creatures take energy from somewhere. We all use it to create, to change it into something better. The knowledge of Arcadia has shown us the road to the ultimate transformation. And yet you will not take that road! Why do you reject the obvious?"
5059,"Athos: I am not opposed to the quest for power, for greater knowledge. However, that quest must be driven from within. To fuel your quest with the stolen lives of others, this brings not wisdom but abomination."
5060,Nergal: Heh heh heh... I remember. I still remember! Those words are unchanged from when you first said them ages back. When you and the dragons conspired to bury me!
5061,Nergal: Look at this wound! The wound I took from your magic!! It was a mistake. The only person who understood... The man I thought my truest friend... It was a mistake to try and destroy me. Heh heh heh heh... It confirmed some things for me. That trust brings betrayal. That friends bring weakness!
5062,"Eliwood: If that is what you learned from your encounter, then you are a fool. Do you believe for a moment that, when wise Athos struck down his dearest friend, he felt nothing!? His heart was torn in two, and yet you refuse to understand that!"
5063,Athos: Eliwood...
5064,"Eliwood: Nergal! I will defeat you! Here! Today!! But...even now, there is no hatred in my heart. You who were born human, you who lost the heart that defines your humanity... For you, I have nothing but pity."
5065,"Nergal: ...Pity? Heh heh heh... Amusing. A weak fool like you has ""pity"" for me? Interesting... Now, if you hope to defeat me, you may have your chance. Of course, you will have to best my morphs first!"
5066,"Eliwood: Listen to me! This is my fight now! Mine alone! Everyone, stay back!"
5067,"Hector: Hey! What are you talking about? We've come this far together, haven't we?"
5068,Lyn: That's right! I've said it before. We all feel the same way.
5069,Eliwood: Hector... Lyndis...
5070,"Nils: Don't forget me, Lord Eliwood! And...Ninian. I'm sure she's here as well."
5071,"Eliwood: Nils... Ah! Tactician, you, too?"
5072,Marcus: I’ll show you the strength of a knight of Pherae.
5073,"Lowen: Knights should fight, not speak! …Was that right?"
5074,Rebecca: I'll do whatever I can to help!
5075,Dorcas: …Winning this battle means protecting my family.
5076,Bartre: Whooooooooooa! I’m burning up!
5077,Oswin: For the honor of the knights of Ostia.
5078,Matthew: Let me handle this! There’s much I can do.
5079,"Serra: Blessed Saint Elimine, grant us strength to win this with ease."
5080,Guy: Let me show you how much my blade has matured!
5081,"Priscilla: I don’t want to lose anyone, so I will fight my strongest."
5082,"Erk: For years, I’ve studied. Now, let those studies show their worth!"
5083,Florina: I... I...I'll do my best!
5084,Kent: I will gladly volunteer to protect Lycia with my life.
5085,Sain: I won’t hold back! This is for all the lovely ladies I’ve yet to meet!!
5086,Wil: We’ve made it this far. Let’s get out there and win!
5087,Raven: If I die here… so be it.
5088,"Lucius: Blessed Saint Elimine, please grant us a miracle..."
5089,Canas: Let this battle be forgotten by history... That is all I ask.
5090,"Dart: I’m Dart, brave crewman of Fargus’s pirates, and I fear nothing!"
5091,"Fiora: For the honor of the Pegasus knights of Ilia, I will annihilate the foe!"
5092,"Legault: My oh my… Fools aplenty. That includes me, too."
5093,"Heath: For Bern, land of my birth… May I return to it soon!"
5094,Rath: For those whose reasoning is bent. I will straighten it with my bow.
5095,Isadora: My pride shall not be broken! My strength holds true!
5096,"Hawkeye: …I, too, will join you in this final glory."
5097,Farina: Hey! There’s no doubt we’ll win! Just don’t forget my bonus!
5098,"Pent: If he has power to rival Athos, then I must test that power myself."
5099,"Louise: No matter what happens, I’ll be at Lord Pent’s side."
5100,Harken: Lord Elbert… I will protect your son.
5101,"Karel: As long as there’s someone to cut, you will have my aid."
5102,Wallace: I’m trembling with anticipation!
5103,Geitz: This looks like fun! This is what I’ve been waiting for!!
5104,Nino: ...Father... Brothers...... For all that I've lost... I won't let him get away!
5105,Jaffar: ……
5106,Karla: I’ve lived long enough. I’ve no regrets…
5107,"Vaida: What are you worried about? With me here, we can’t lose!"
5108,Renault: It is for this moment that I have lived…
5109,Eliwood: Everyone... Let's go! We've got to stop Nergal!
5110,"Hector: Everyone… Here we go! Give it your all, and beat this knave!"
5111,Lloyd: ……………
5112,"Legault: …Huh, even as a monster, you are a handsome one, Lloyd. But you know something? I can’t let this continue!!"
5113,Lloyd: ……………
5114,Lloyd: ……………
5115,Nino: Ah…Lloyd… …Sniff…oh…… Why does this have to happen again?
5116,Lloyd: ……………
5117,Linus: ……………
5118,Legault: Oh… We meet again. …Linus… This stinks!!
5119,Linus: ……………
5120,Linus: ……………
5121,"Nino: Linus… I’ll…see you again… I’m sure you’re angry, but… Please be my friend…again…"
5122,Linus: ……………
5123,Uhai: ……………
5124,Legault: …Uhai…why did this blasphemy occur? …I’ll put an end to it right away!
5125,Uhai: ……………
5126,Brendan: ……………
5127,Legault: …Commander… I really didn’t want to see you like this. …All I can give you is one last act of rebellion.
5128,Brendan: ……………
5129,Brendan: ……………
5130,Nino: Father… Fa-Father… I… I’ll…end this……I’m sorry…
5131,Brendan: ……………
5132,Eliwood: Nergal!
5133,"Nergal: So you're here, Eliwood. I thought losing Ninian might distract you. Have you forgotten her so quickly? How heartless."
5134,Eliwood: I haven't forgotten. I'll never forget. It was my mistake that killed Ninian. Because of that... I will fight. I will not run away and hide in sorrow... I'm going to put an end to all this!
5135,"Nergal: Did you know, Eliwood? What happened to your friend Hector? What he was thinking as he fought by your side?"
5136,Eliwood: ......
5137,Nergal: Heh heh... It's a pity. If only he had been free to return to Ostia.
5138,Eliwood: I know that I've caused much pain for my friends. But that is why... I will not lose here today!!
5139,Nergal: Little girl from Sacae... You'd do well to vanish. One such as you is no match for me.
5140,Lyn: The nomads of the plains do not abandon their fellow tribespeople. Eliwood and Hector are my dear friends... Their sorrow is my sorrow. Their anger is my anger.
5141,Nergal: Pah...
5142,"Lyn: Nergal! In my friends' names, I will cut you down!"
5143,Nino: ......
5144,Nergal: Uhn? Who do you think you are?
5145,"Nino: You will pay! You stole my family from me, and you will pay, Nergal!!! I will avenge them all!"
5146,"Nergal: Now, I see... You're Sonia's..."
5147,Jaffar: ......
5148,"Nergal: Hmph... It's you, Jaffar? Turning your sword against me, your master? Do you forget who raised you? You are worthless."
5149,Jaffar: ...Wrong. I am a man.
5150,"Nergal: Oh, really? If so, then I will give you a man's death!"
5151,"Renault: ...Nergal, do you remember me?"
5152,Nergal: Hah. You are... Renault. So you're still seeking out a wretched existence?
5153,Renault: I went astray. I listened to your honeyed words... I dreamt of the impossible... the return of a lost soul. But...what you gave me was... a puppet... It was soulless...nothing more than an empty vessel!!
5154,"Nergal: Just an empty vessel... Isn't that what you wanted? You desired to bring back your dead friend. You were my experiment, and I completed my morph. I'm grateful, Renault. Thanks to you, I gained power."
5155,Renault: You villain... You cursed him! Your crime can never be forgiven! I will end you with my hands. In the name of my lost friend!
5156,Hector: Nergal!
5157,"Nergal: So you've come, Hector of Ostia. Your existence itself was my greatest miscalculation. If it had only been Eliwood, this could have been over. So, my little miscalculation, I will erase you. And leave no trace remaining."
5158,Hector: Do your worst!!
5159,Hector: Nergal!
5160,"Nergal: I cannot understand you, Hector of Ostia. Why would you do all this for Eliwood? Is this miserable thing called friendship worth dying for?"
5161,Hector: I don't expect you to understand. You've forgotten what it means to be human! Nergal! My connection to you… it's over! I'm finishing everything up right here!!
5162,Athos: Nergal...
5163,Nergal: Heh heh... Athos... Take a good look at me! At my tremendous power!
5164,Athos: Already...words are useless. As an old friend... I will fulfill my duty.
5165,Hector: It’s…finished.
5166,Lyn: Yes… At long last…
5167,Eliwood: …Father…
5168,Nils: … … …
5169,Hector: What was that!?
5170,Lyn: What on earth… What happened?
5171,Eliwood: It can’t be…
5172,Hector: Ah!
5173,Lyn: Th… Are those… Dragons?
5174,Eliwood: Nergal’s final warning… This is what he meant!
5175,Athos: What a calamity! If dragons return to this world… The continent will be ash in less than a month!!
5176,Eliwood: This must end at any cost! I will stop it!!
5177,Eliwood: So these are dragons.
5178,Hector: Look at the size of them. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. My… My legs are trembling just standing here.
5179,Lyn: There are three of them… I don’t know if we can do this. I… We need some kind of help.
5180,Athos: I’ll do what I can. I’ll halt the dragons. Strike there!!
5181,Athos: Ahh… So powerful. Can they be stopped?
5182,Eliwood: Lord Athos! Flee! The dragons are getting closer!!
5183,"Athos: …If we can’t stop them here, we are…lost."
5184,Athos: Bramimond!
5185,Bramimond: … Preparations…took time… …OK. I require everyone’s strength. Gather here the legendary power!
5186,Eliwood: Ah!! This light…
5187,Hector: Uwaa! What… What is it!?
5188,Lyn: Look! There…!
5189,Bramimond: Bring her back… Let the dragon girl’s soul be restored.
5190,Eliwood: Ninian!!
5191,Nils: …Ah! Ninian…
5192,Ninian: Where… Where am I?
5193,Bramimond: Girl with the exalted blood of dragons. Use that power to appease them.
5194,Ninian: …Ah…it’s not …possible. Use my power… in this world……
5195,Bramimond: Do you not feel it? Your power returning?
5196,Ninian: …What? ……Ah…… …Yes… … … … …I will try.
5197,Ninian: That’s enough. I’m sorry… This is not your fault… …I’m sorry.
5198,Ninian: No… no more……
5199,Eliwood: Ninian!!
5200,Nils: It’s OK. She only fainted. Thank goodness… Ninian……
5201,Bramimond: One dragon still remains. Leave the girl to me. I shall tend to her.
5202,Athos: Chosen ones! You must stop the final dragon! You must save us all!!
5203,Hector: Eliwood!!
5204,Lyn: Eliwood!
5205,Nils: Lord Eliwood!
5206,Eliwood: I’m here! I’m right here!
5207,"Athos: Well done, brave successor to Roland. It’s finally over. Finally, everything is…"
5208,Eliwood: Lord Athos!?
5209,"Athos: Ha… Looks like I’ve exhausted my strength. I… I’ll die before you, friend."
5210,Bramimond: …I may well follow you soon. For now…I will sleep again.
5211,"Athos: Eliwood…Hector, Lyn…I’ve lived a long, long time, but now…I’m done. Do not grieve. Soon, I will be with long-absent friends. … I have no regrets."
5212,Eliwood: Lord Athos!!
5213,"Athos: Now…my friends, my family. Let me give you a parting gift… As I lay dying… I see many things. I see the future… Oh… Why? Why… is this not now? Neither Bramimond nor I… will be…here… to help a land…in need…"
5214,Lyn: What…do you see?
5215,"Athos: An evil star…rises in Bern…All of Elibe will be once again awash in blood… But do not fear. Once again, Lycia brings hope. Children of fire… …Everything… ……"
5216,Eliwood: Lord Athos… Even at the end…he thought of us…
5217,Hector: …Graybeard…
5218,"Lyn: …Look, both of you. Lord Athos… It’s almost as though he’s smiling."
5219,Ninian: …This world will once again be enveloped by darkness…But… at the end… a saving light shall rise.
5220,Eliwood: Ninian!
5221,Ninian: Lord Eliwood…
5222,Eliwood: I’m so happy…I can’t believe you’re back. I feel like this is all a dream. Once I lost you… I knew for sure. I need you. I want you by my side forever.
5223,Ninian: Lord Eliwood…I… …I must go home…
5224,Eliwood: What do you mean?!
5225,Ninian: I’m…the cause of all of this. It was my weakness that invited this tragedy…
5226,Eliwood: Ninian?
5227,Ninian: Here on Elibe… …we were nurtured for ages in the land of our birth. Even after humans invaded and drove us out….. Not a day passed that I did not think of it…..I yearned to see it once again… Our homeland… Those children… the fire dragons…They were like me…..
5228,Nils: …..
5229,Ninian: We knew that it was forbidden. And yet we answered Nergal’s call and opened the gate… We didn’t intend to stay long… Just to see home one last time. But Nergal captured us and… it led to this.
5230,"Eliwood: We humans, we took control of the continent like it was our right. We never considered who or what we drove away… …Ninian, Nils, the blame for this was never yours alone. While we can claim ignorance, we still bear some responsibility."
5231,"Nils: …Lord Eliwood, do you truly believe that?"
5232,"Eliwood: I do. If my father were here, he would say the same thing. Let’s work together and think about the future. If the entire continent were made a place where dragons and humans could live together like the hidden city Lord Athos spoke of, Arcadia…"
5233,"Ninian: What a wonderful world that would be…But that’s certainly something that won’t happen for a long, long time. So we… we can’t stay here. The gate is still open. If it remains so, other dragons will certainly pass through. Before that happens, we must return to our world. We must regain our power and seal the gate…from that side."
5234,Eliwood: Are you saying I’ll never see you again? That can’t be!
5235,Ninian: Lord Eliwood…I am truly blessed that I have had the chance to meet you. Please… Please… Don’t forget me!
5236,Eliwood: Ninian!!
5237,"Ninian: ….. Come, Nils. Let us go. We must return to our world…"
5238,"Nils: Ninian… The air of this world, it’s changed so much from what we knew. No matter how much time passes, our strength will never return. If we stay here, we will not survive long."
5239,Ninian: Nils? Why do you…
5240,"Nils: But even knowing that your life will be short…Ninian…You truly wish to remain here, don’t you? I understand… Stay here. Stay with Lord Eliwood."
5241,Ninian: Nils?
5242,Nils: Lord Eliwood… Ninian… No…My sister… Please cherish her.
5243,Eliwood: I will. I will make her happy. …I swear it.
5244,Ninian: Nils! You… Are you…
5245,Nils: Mm. I’m going alone. I want to live a long time. I don’t have your curiosity.
5246,Ninian: …Nils…..
5247,"Nils: …Ok then, I’m going."
5248,"Hector: Be well, Nils!"
5249,Lyn: I’ll miss you…
5250,Eliwood: I’ll never forget you.
5251,Ninian: … …..Nils…
5252,"Nils: Don’t cry, Ninian… Even if we’re apart, if we never see each other again, our bond will never, ever be cut… More importantly, Sister…Live as long… and be as happy as you can, for as long as you can."
5253,Ninian: Nils!!
5254,"Eliwood: Thank you, Nils."
5255,"Hector: Oh, daybreak!"
5256,"Lyn: Beautiful, isn’t it. The start of another day."
5257,"Eliwood: Ninian… You’ll come with me, won’t you?"
5258,Ninian: Yes!
5259,"Eliwood: Good to see you, Ninian."
5260,Ninian: Lord Eliwood…I worried you…Uhm…I…I…wish to apologize…..
5261,Eliwood: What? What do you mean?
5262,Ninian: I was…the cause for all of this. It was my weakness that invited this tragedy…
5263,Eliwood: Ninian?
5264,Ninian: Here on Elibe… …we were nurtured for ages in the land of our birth. Even after humans invaded and drove us out….. Not a day passed that I did not think of it…..I yearned to see it once again… Our homeland… Those children… the fire dragons…They were like me…..
5265,Nils: …..
5266,Ninian: We knew that it was forbidden. And yet we answered Nergal’s call and opened the gate… We didn’t intend to stay long… Just to see home one last time. But Nergal captured us and… it led to this.
5267,"Eliwood: We humans, we took control of the continent like it was our right. We never considered who or what we drove away… …Ninian, Nils, the blame for this was never yours alone. While we can claim ignorance, we still bear some responsibility."
5268,"Nils: …Lord Eliwood, do you truly believe that?"
5269,"Eliwood: I do. If my father were here, he would say the same thing. Let’s work together and think about the future. If the entire continent were made a place where dragons and humans could live together like the hidden city Lord Athos spoke of, Arcadia…"
5270,"Ninian: What a wonderful world that would be…But that’s certainly something that won’t happen for a long, long time. So we… we can’t stay here. The gate is still open. If it remains so, other dragons will certainly pass through. Before that happens, we must return to our world. We must regain our power and seal the gate…from that side."
5271,Eliwood: Are you saying I’ll never see you again? That can’t be!
5272,Ninian: Lord Eliwood…I am truly blessed that I have had the chance to meet you. Please… Please… Don’t forget me!
5273,Eliwood: Ninian!!
5274,"Ninian: ….. Come, Nils. Let us go. We must return to our world…"
5275,"Nils: Lord Eliwood! Lord Hector! Lady Lyn! …Thank you! My opinion of humans has changed since meeting all of you. There are humans in the world we’re returning to, too. Finding a way to live together may be hard… but we’re going to try."
5276,Hector: Ok! Good luck!
5277,Lyn: I’ll miss you…
5278,Eliwood: Take care! Both of you!
5279,"Ninian: Thank you. Be well, everyone…"
5280,"Hector: Oh, daybreak!"
5281,"Lyn: Beautiful, isn’t it. The start of another day."
5282,Eliwood: Let’s go home. To Lycia!
5283,"Eliwood: So here you are, Mark! Will you attend my ascension ceremony? Hector and everyone else is coming... What? These clothes? I look silly, don't I. Formal dress is so stiff, I can't stand it... Ah... Everything's finally resolved. I'll succeed my father as Marquess Pherae. I don't know if I'm equal to the task, but I'm going to do my best for all the people who live here. Mark, you... Do you really have to go? No, I understand. I'm sure that you have things you must do. Thank you for supporting me in everything."
5284,???: ...Eliwood? Where are you?
5285,"Eliwood: I'm over here, Lyndis."
5286,"Lyn: Oh, Mark! You're here, too. So, Eliwood, have you spoken to Mark?"
5287,Eliwood: Mark will be at the ceremony of ascension but must leave shortly thereafter.
5288,"Lyn: Oh, no... Really? That's too bad."
5289,"Eliwood: Oh, Mark, I want you to know something. When things are a little more settled, Lyndis and I plan to be married. And...this may be premature but, Mark, we'd like you to name our first child. Lyndis and I talked it over. You've done so much for us and we truly want this."
5290,"Lyn: Please, Mark."
5291,Fiora: ...Lord Eliwood?
5292,"Eliwood: I'm over here, Fiora!"
5293,"Fiora: Oh, and you're here too, Mark. So, ...Lord Eliwood, is Mark..."
5294,Eliwood: Mark will be at the ceremony of ascension but must leave shortly thereafter.
5295,Fiora: Is that so? How disappointing...
5296,"Eliwood: Oh, Mark, I want you to know something. When things are a little more settled, Fiora and I plan to be married. And...this may be a bit premature but, Mark, we'd like you to name our first child. Fiora and I talked it over. You've done so much for us and we truly want this."
5297,"Fiora: Please, Mark."
5298,"Eliwood: So, Mark, this is farewell. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't... This world wouldn't be here. You have my heartfelt gratitude. Mark... I'll see you again. It's a promise...my friend."
5299,"Hector: Thanks for coming, Eliwood!"
5300,"Eliwood: Hector! Long time, no see!"
5301,"Hector: First time since my brother's funeral--fifteen years now. And look at us. We've both grown older, haven't we?"
5302,"Eliwood: Uh-huh. Time certainly does speed right by. My father's disappearance...his death...the fight with Nergal...those fire dragons... The memories are so vivid, it might have happened yesterday."
5303,Hector: Nergal... What a blackheart he was. I've had enough of battles like that. Hm? Is that your son over there?
5304,"Eliwood: I've been wanting to introduce you, but there's been no chance. Roy! Come here!"
5305,"Roy: Did you need something, Father?"
5306,Eliwood: Say hello to Marquess Ostia!
5307,"Roy: Ye-Yes, sir! A pleasure to meet you, Lord Hector. My name is Roy."
5308,"Hector: Roy, is it? Nice to meet you, lad. Well, I guess that means I should introduce my daughter then! Lilina!"
5309,Lilina: .......
5310,Hector: What? Are you being shy? You don't have to be nervous. This is your father's old friend and his son.
5311,Lilina: .......
5312,"Eliwood: Hello, Lilina. This is Roy. He's the same age as you."
5313,Lilina: Nice to meet you...
5314,Roy: Lilina? Let's be friends. We can play over there.
5315,Lilina: .......
5316,Hector: It's OK. Go on.
5317,Lilina: Ah!
5318,Eliwood: What a cute child. Good thing she took after her mother.
5319,"Hector: What? She looks just like me, doesn't she?"
5320,"Eliwood: You're a sarcastic one, Marquess Ostia!"
5321,"Hector: Come on, now you're the one putting on airs, Marquess Pherae!"
5322,Eliwood: Ha ha ha ha! The only thing older about you is your appearance. Don't tell me you still behave like that even now that you're the marquess!
5323,"Hector: I'm always on top of my duties as marquess. But when I'm around you, I want to relax, so, please..."
5324,"Eliwood: Hector... By the way, I heard that the king of Bern died. It was fairly sudden, too."
5325,"Hector: I can't be certain, but according to one of our spies, he was killed in an assassination attempt on Prince Zephiel."
5326,Eliwood: The prince? I trust he was unharmed.
5327,"Hector: It's a strange tale... At first, I'd heard that the prince was killed. Then new information came three days later saying that it was the king who had died."
5328,Eliwood: Do you remember Archsage Athos's prediction? Is something happening in Bern?
5329,Hector: I don't know.
5330,Lilina: Father! Can I show Roy my pony?
5331,"Hector: Yes, go ahead. Be careful!"
5332,Lilina: OK!
5333,"Hector: For the sake of our children's futures, I'll stop anything that may happen. I'll sacrifice my life to make it so."
5334,"Eliwood: ""Once again, Lycia brings hope."" ...If that turns out to be wrong? No. It must happen..."
5335,Enigmatic Man: For what reason have you awakened a demon dragon?
5336,Zephiel: Who are you?
5337,Enigmatic Man: ...Dragon.
