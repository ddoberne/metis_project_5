HECTOR:   Ah, Eliwood! It's good to see you're still well!
ELIWOOD:  Hm.  You expected otherwise?
HECTOR:   No, of course not, I knew you'd be fine.
ELIWOOD:  Hector, wait for a moment.  What did you want?
HECTOR:   Nothing.  It's enough to see that you live and are still fighting.
          Just wanted to make sure you weren't overdoing it with me not around.
ELIWOOD:  I should say the same to you.
HECTOR:   Me? don't worry about me.  I'm fine.  I'm built tough you know.  A
          little too much is just enough for me.  But you, you've never been
          a hardy one, Eliwood.  Nor are you used to travel.  Go on too long,
          and you'll collapse.
ELIWOOD:  We're all weaklings compared to you, Hector. ...Thankfully wars are
          not won by strength alone, eh? We've been sparring once every two
          months since we were twelve, and of the 30 matches, 14 I won, 12 I
          lost, and 4 were draws.
HECTOR:   Erh? I think not! I recall 31 matches--an even 13-13 split, with
          5 draws!
ELIWOOD:  Yes, well, you recall wrong.  I'm in the right.
HECTOR:   Hmph.  And what makes you so certain?
ELIWOOD:  Whoose snoring was it that shook the rafters in numbers class?
HECTOR:   Ah, good point.
ELIWOOD:  ...Still, I'm touched you were worried about me.  Now, back to
          the fray!
HECTOR:   Hey, wait! ...Blast.

COMMENTS: I was snoring during numbers class too, so that average score might
be off.  Overall this is a good SC, it provides some information about Eliwood
and Hector's past and adds a bit of comedy too, which is always a plus in my
book.

ELIWOOD:  Something, wrong Hector? Was that a yawn I saw? Not the best
          battlefield manners.
HECTOR:   Ah... It's nothing.  Just my dreams lately...
ELIWOOD:  Dreams? What kind of dreams?
HECTOR:   Laugh, and I'll kill you.
ELIWOOD:  ...All right.
HECTOR:   There was this man--a giant with a beard--carrying a girl on his
          shoulders.  The girl called to him "Father," and she was smiling,
          happy.  Then the father said to her, "Yes, my beloved daughter?"
          That's all, really.  But it felt as though... It felt like a
          long-past memory.  The man looked a bit like my own father, I
          suppose.  But who was the little girl? Aye, she was a cute one.
ELIWOOD:  What color was her hair?
HECTOR:   huh.  Blue.
ELIWOOD:  And the man's hair? his moustache?
HECTOR:   His were bluish, too.
ELIWOOD:  Then it is a vision on your own future! A great moustache, eh?
          Ah hah hah!
HECTOR:   Grr... You laughed! Hm.  If that is my future I'm not sure I like it.
ELIWOOD:  Why not?
HECTOR:   The girl that would be my daughter... She gets taken away by this
          boy that appears later.  ...A boy with red hair! Yes, it was red, I'm
          sure of it.
ELIWOOD:  Don't get ahead of yourself! there are plenty of people with
          red hair...
HECTOR:   Quiet! now I'm sure--the boy was a Pheraen.  No matter how close we
          may be, I'll not--I'll not give up my daughter!
ELIWOOD:  Hector! Let's hope your dream doesn't come true, eh? For my sake.

be... no it couldn't! Could it!? Haha, anyways, this SC gives great, uh...
forestory? Hector can see into the future somehow or another.  Some great
comedy mixed in here as well.  A great SC.

ELIWOOD/HECTOR     A RANK     CC003

ELIWOOD:  Hector, you still remember that time?
HECTOR:   What time?
ELIWOOD:  You know, what was it--ten years ago? When the lords of Lycia held
          the oath rites, back in Ostia? "Should one land of Lycia be attacked,
          all will fight at one..." Remember? While our parents were off
          pledging thier oaths, we were kids in that one room.
HECTOR:   Yeah, I remember.  We had to act in a manner befitting the children
          of nobility, or some such nonsense.  I just remember being stuck in
          there, having to sit in that chair talking to whoever was next to me.
          Course, wouldn't you know that Erik of Laus was on my right? Man, I
          heard more than enough sweet talk from that one!
ELIWOOD:  Right, right.  That was the first time any of us met, after all.
          He had no idea who you were--he just wanted to get in favor with a
          lordling of Lycia.
HECTOR:   Aye, he was all mouth anyway.  Saying things like "let us join forces
          for the good of Lycia," and such... then running when things turned
          sour.
ELIWOOD:  Aw, don't be too hard on him.  When he jumped up, yelling about us
          swearing our own oaths, then cut his hand like that... No one else
          knew what to do, either.
HECTOR:   Well, everyone's heard the stories.  They all know it's the warrior's
          custom.  Each cuts his own hand, then shakes hands with his
          brothers... What man wouldn't want to do that? Only one had the guts
          to meet him, though.
ELIWOOD:  ...You know, back then, I'm proud I took your hand.  We are friends,
          sharing a life-dream now, an ambition.  When one is in danger, the
          other risks his life to protect him... That's why you came, isn't it?
          Because you remembered?
HECTOR:   Heh.  I've got no plans to break my oath.  Not now, not ever.
ELIWOOD:  Likewise.
HECTOR:   Well, then lets live long and in health! I don't want to hear any
          excuses about not being able to come help when we're old men.
ELIWOOD:  It's a deal.  ...Stay alive, Hector.
HECTOR:   Deal.  And don't you go dying before me, either.  I'd never forgive
          you.

a great deal of laughs but it's a interesting SC, as it provides a bit of

MARCUS:   Lord Eliwood! You are not hurt?
ELIWOOD:  Marcus? Thanks, I'm fine.
MARCUS:   Perhaps it is not my place... But, Lord Eliwood, you should
          stay out of combat, I think.  Let me deal with the enemy!
          You can join me, Lord Eliwood, and thus travel in safety...
ELIWOOD:  I'm afraid that cannot be.  This is my journey to make.
          It is my responsibility.
MARCUS:   Lord Eliwood! Well, I cannot say that I am not impressed by
          your strength.  You have truly grown, and for that, I am
          joyful.
ELIWOOD:  Ah, Marcus, your sentiments are always larger than life.
MARCUS:   But it does make me lonely, you know.  When you were born,
          Lord Eliwood... Why, I had just recieved the honor of
          knighthood.  When you were little, oh, how you would follow
          me everywhere!
ELIWOOD:  Stop it, you embarrass me, good friend.

Eliwood, and that he is very proud of how he has grown.  A decent SC I suppose.

MARCUS:   Lord Eliwood...
ELIWOOD:  Marcus?
MARCUS:   I have been watching your progress on your journey...
ELIWOOD:  What is it? There's no need for formalities with me.
MARCUS:   Ah, it's just, I was thinking how much you've grown... Even on this
          journey, seeing you going off to battle, brave and strong. You have
          much of your father's presence.
ELIWOOD:  You think so?
MARCUS:   I do. Mine eyes fill with tears of joy, truly...
ELIWOOD:  There you go with the poetry again, Marcus. ...That reminds me of
          something my father once spoke of. Marcus, you went into battle by
          my father when he was young?
MARCUS:   Indeed. I was just a page at the time. But under Lord Elbert's
          command I swung my spear as best as I could.
ELIWOOD:  And you fight by my side on this, my journey, as well.
MARCUS:   I made a promise to Lord Elbert. I swore to protect the lord Eliwood
          until his return. Knights of Pherae always carry out their orders,
          you see.
ELIWOOD:  And Pherae owes its very existence to you, Marcus. Thank you.
MARCUS:   Thanks are wasted on me. I merely do my duty.

ELIWOOD/MARCUS     A RANK     CC006

MARCUS:   Lord Eliwood!
ELIWOOD:  Marcus! It's good to see you are well--
MARCUS:   ...ung...
ELIWOOD:  M-Marcus!? What is wrong!
MARCUS:   To concern yourself with a mere retainer in the midst of battle...
          Even in such a horrid conflict as this one, still you have lost none
          of your heart, Lord Eliwood.
ELIWOOD:  Your sentiments could make a mourner smile, Marcus!
MARCUS:   Take care of your heart, Lord Eliwood. You will need it to lead your
          people upon your return to Pherae.
ELIWOOD:  Yes...let us all return to Pherae together. For that alone, we must
          win this battle. Should we fall on the road, my dear mother's heart
          would never mend.
MARCUS:   Do not worry, my young lord. I, Marcus, will defend you. I have sworn
          that Lord Eliwood will return safely to Pherae. And return you shall,
          to find a lovely, kind wife to lead with you. Then you will follow in
          Lord Elbert's footsteps. Then, when your child is grown and ready to
          go off into battle, I, Marcus, will be there to accompany and protect
          him!
ELIWOOD:  Marcus... I know no knight of Pherae more worthy of the title than
          you. I thank you, as does my future son.
MARCUS:   It occurs to me... When Lord Elbert became engaged to the Lady
          Eleanora... Why he was the same age you are now, Lord Eliwood. As a
          faithful retainer of Pherae, I must make haste to find you a suitable
          wife!

LOWEN:    You must forgive me! I... I had no intention... I am sorry!
          Ohh... Were General Marcus to find out... I'm finished!
          Through!
ELIWOOD:  Lowen? Perhaps you could tell me what happened?
LOWEN:    Yes... Yes, my lord.  ... ... It is that...uh... This
          morning, you see... Did... Did you eat breakfast, my lord?
ELIWOOD:  Breakfast?
LOWEN:    As I thought! You haven't had breakfast, have you!?
ELIWOOD:  Ah...um, yes, now that you mention it.  I was busy, I must
          have forgotten.
LOWEN:    I knew it! It is my fault--I overslept! And now Lord Eliwood
          has gone without breakfast!
ELIWOOD:  L-Lowen, please.  Missing one meal is not such a big affair...
LOWEN:    Oh, but it is! this is a most unforgivable oversight! "If the stomach
          is empty, empty, too, lies the heart." You know the proverb!
ELIWOOD:  Actually, that's the first time I ever heard that one.
LOWEN:    Then you must remember it from henceforth! "If the stomach is empty,
          empty, too, lies the heart." Remember?
ELIWOOD:  Um, yes.
LOWEN:    Good! Then, I shall bring something for you to eat forthwith! ... ...

COMMENTS: What to say, this one sucks big time.  I mean it's Lowen lecturing
Eliwood about the importance of eating breakfast? "yawn".  Eliwood makes a
couple comments that warrant its comedy at least half a point.  My diagnosis
Lowen is very dull.

ELIWOOD:  It's really no matter...but may I ask you something?
LOWEN:    Yes! Your will is my command!
ELIWOOD:  When you collapsed then... Was it really because you hadn't eaten
          breakfast?
LOWEN:    Yes, of course!
ELIWOOD:  Hmm...I see.
LOWEN:    What!? Do you mean to say, Lord Eliwood, that you never collapse?
ELIWOOD:  Not just from missing a meal or two, no.

ELIWOOD:  ...Just a passing faintness.

ELIWOOD:  ...Yes, quite.
LOWEN:    Indeed! That is good to hear!
ELIWOOD:  Lowen, I've been meaning to ask you...
LOWEN:    How was it--the taste, I mean? I was rather proud of my work today,
          I must admit.
ELIWOOD:  Er... Wait a moment--The food I'm eating...You've been preparing it?
LOWEN:    Why, yes!
ELIWOOD:  You...an esquire... Why?
LOWEN:    My father was the chef to the previous marquess of Pherae... In other
          words, Lord Eliwood, he cooked for your grandfather. Until he through
          his back out, that is... Your father, too, acquired a taste for his
          cooking, you see. So when I had the pleasure of joining him on his
          tours of the domain, I always took it upon myself to prepare his
          every meal!
ELIWOOD:  Oh, I get it now...
LOWEN:    I am afraid I do not know your tastes, Lord Eliwood. Everything I
          have made up on this trip, has been things your lord father, Elbert,
          favored. I do hope you find them suitable to your palate?
ELIWOOD:  For an esquire such as yourself to cook... With your patrol and watch
          duties, where do you find the time? I mean, you really don't have
          to...
LOWEN:    Ever since Lord Elbert went missing... Lord Eliwood's meals have
          grown smaller. You don't eat! The Lady Eleanora and General Marcus
          have been quite concerned. Yet when you left on your journey and I
          began to cook for you, we found you would eat more... I've been
          cooking for you ever since.
ELIWOOD:  Lowen... I had no idea!
LOWEN:    Please, don't think of it. Seeing Lord Eliwood healthy brings us
          much joy.
ELIWOOD:  Thank you. I will do my best to clean my plate henceforth, hungry or
          not! I meant to tell you, the food has been quite delicious.

NINIAN:   That sounds like fun!
ELIWOOD:  You should come, too, Ninian.  Everyone would be happy to see your

NINIAN:   Thank you.
ELIWOOD:  My mother, too, loves dancing, you know.  She would be pleased.  At

ELIWOOD:  Forgive me.  You...must think of my father often enough.
NINIAN:   No...it's all right.  I mean, not compared to you, Lord Eliwood...
ELIWOOD:  Ninian, remember what I told you?  My father's death was not your
          fault.  You should not blame yourself, not at all.
NINIAN:   But, Lord Eliwood... y-you're wrong.  You don't know everything
          that...
ELIWOOD:  What?
NINIAN:   I... I have been deceiving you.
ELIWOOD:  Deceiving? What do you mean?
NINIAN:   It is just... I-I'm sorry.

          course.
ELIWOOD:  I don't know any ladies skilled in the martial arts.  Most of them
          never leave the castle, for that matter.  The only time I see them
          are at the banquets and such.
LYNDIS:   Banquets...I see.  Those are no place for someone from the plains,
          like me.  Oh well... Chancellor Reissmann tells me I need to learn
          manners.  I have to attend all these affairs in place of my ill
          grandfather, you see.  The chancellor doesn't think I act enough like
          a lady of Caelin.  That's why I was hoping to find a lady that could
          teach me.
ELIWOOD:  You've got your work cut out for you.
LYNDIS:   Say, could you teach me, Eliwood? Teach me how to act like a lady!
ELIWOOD:  You think I know!?
LYNDIS:   ...No, I guess you wouldn't.  Ahhh... My grandfather must be vexed
          to have me as a grandchild.  My late mother was gentle, well mannered,
          and beautiful...
ELIWOOD:  Well, you're beautiful, Lyndis.
LYNDIS:   Wha--? E-Eliwood! What did you--?
ELIWOOD:  Yeah, when we were sparring this last time, I was thinking... The way
          you move, so like the wind.  It was like watching a beautiful dance.
LYNDIS:   Oh! My swordplay is beautiful... Right, you have leave to say that.

COMMENTS: Seems like Lyndis longs for a girl friend who can relate to her
passion with a weapon but also teach her the finer points about being a woman.
Bit of comedy in here when Lyndis asks Eliwood to teach her how to act like a
lady. I think Eliwood was refering to her swordplay when he said Lyndis was
beautiful, we shall see...

LYNDIS:   Say, Eliwood.
ELIWOOD:  Ah, Lyndis! You've gotten much better since our last match. I'll have
          to do my best not to fall behind!
LYNDIS:   Yes, well... about sparring... I was wondering if you might not teach
          me something else?
ELIWOOD:  Something else?
LYNDIS:   Yes, well, you know! Even if you can't teach me about being a lady,
          there is much to learn...
ELIWOOD:  Manners and such? That's fine by me, but I think you're worrying too
          much. You should relax, take it in stride.
LYNDIS:   Yes, but I have so far to go! I'm not like a lady at all. My
          grandfather took me in, a mixed-blood child, but I fear the other
          nobles of Lycia will not be so accepting. I do not want the Sacae
          blood in my veins to bring my grandfather shame.
ELIWOOD:  Hmph. You sound shy--Nothing like the Lyndis I know!
LYNDIS:   What?
ELIWOOD:  When I first saw you in Khathelet, I thought, what strength she has
          in her eyes, that woman. I seem to remember, Lyndis, back then, you
          didn't know what to think about your noble Lycian blood, but the
          Sacae blood in you... for that, you had nothing but the purest pride.
          Remember how you felt. You don't have to be like anyone else, Lyndis.
LYNDIS:   ... ... Yes...you're right. I guess... I guess I lost myself. Thank
          you, Eliwood. I feel better, somewhat.
ELIWOOD:  No need to thank me.
LYNDIS:   When I was on the plains, I used to despise the nobility. But I've
          changed. I think it happened a year ago, when I met you. You...you
          believed in me. You helped me.
ELIWOOD:  Hey, I wouldn't have made it this far without your help, too. You
          are my good friend. This is what friends do! Now, shall we?

ELIWOOD:  Fiora, tell me... You are Florina's elder sister, are you not?
FIORA:    I am. She is a shy girl, always aware of other people's eyes. When
          she went off for her apprenticeship I worried and worried.
ELIWOOD:  You are a good sister.
FIORA:    I wish that were so.
ELIWOOD:  You are both knights, yes? That's rare in Lycia.
FIORA:    Yes, as children we decided that we would become pegasus knights. I
          did not want to send my own child sister to war... But Ilia offered
          few options other than the mercenary way.
ELIWOOD:  I see. My father once told me of your homeland, long ago. The ground
          of Ilia is covered year-round in the whitest snow, he said, and it
          is a harsh life for the people who live there. Yet because Ilians
          turn to being mercenaries, they are looked down upon--without
          reason--by other lands.
FIORA:    Yes... But there is nothing to be done about it. No matter how many
          tears we shed, the snow will not melt. Better to fight for my
          homeland and win honor that way, as a member of the pegasus knighs
          of Ilia.
ELIWOOD:  Fiora, I can tell you have a strong sense of responsibility. But do
          not be too hard on yourself. Should you overwork yourself and fall,
          you will end up with nothing.

ELIWOOD:  Hm.  You expected otherwise?
HECTOR:   No, of course not, I knew you'd be fine.
ELIWOOD:  Hector, wait for a moment.  What did you want?
HECTOR:   Nothing.  It's enough to see that you live and are still fighting.
          Just wanted to make sure you weren't overdoing it with me not around.
ELIWOOD:  I should say the same to you.
HECTOR:   Me? don't worry about me.  I'm fine.  I'm built tough you know.  A
          little too much is just enough for me.  But you, you've never been
          a hardy one, Eliwood.  Nor are you used to travel.  Go on too long,

          all will fight at one..." Remember? While our parents were off
          pledging thier oaths, we were kids in that one room.

          sharing a life-dream now, an ambition.  When one is in danger, the
          other risks his life to protect him... That's why you came, isn't it?
          Because you remembered?
HECTOR:   Heh.  I've got no plans to break my oath.  Not now, not ever.
ELIWOOD:  Likewise.
HECTOR:   Well, then lets live long and in health! I don't want to hear any
          excuses about not being able to come help when we're old men.

HECTOR:  You gotta problem with my face? I've just gotta be me, you know...
LYNDIS:  Yes, I know. ...Thanks.  I didn't think you cared so much about how I
         felt.  Or is Hector gentler at heart than Hector looks?  You've
         certainly done much for my courage today.

HECTOR:   Oh? Matthew!
MATTHEW:  I've heard you're quite strong, you know.  But if there's anything
          I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask.  Just say the word, and I'll
          swipe healing balms from our very enemies!
HECTOR:   I might just ask for that later on, yeah.
MATTHEW:  Say, aren't you a bit hungry?
HECTOR:   Hrm... Now that you mention it.  Should've brought some rations or
          something, I guess.
MATTHEW:  leave it to me! I thought we might have need, so I packed some before
          we left.  Here, I put it in your sack there...
HECTOR:   That was thoughtful... ...I mean, hey! What are you doing putting it
          in MY pack?
MATTHEW:  You are strong, young master.
HECTOR:   That's not the point! Man, and I thought my bag was heavy before...

HECTOR:  Huh? You're right, I didn't know... you some distant relation of one of

SERRA:   No, I am a full-blooded member of an Etrurian count's family.
HECTOR:  What, are you serious!?

SERRA:   W-Why do... What of it?
HECTOR:  I was thinking, the only abbey left in the land of Ostia right now is
         the one that was rebuilt when my brother was made marquess.
SERRA:   Ah!
HECTOR:  So...that was the place?
SERRA:   Y-Yes...that was where I grew up.  With children who had lost their
         parents in the war, children from poor villages.  It was an orphanage
         for those children, too, you see...
HECTOR:  You know, I visited there once.  Dismal place, it was.  After my
         brother donated money it got a little better, true...
SERRA:   Y-Yes, I suppose... We were always short on food.  The winters were
         cold, with no wood for the fire, and no warm blankets... But I was

LYNDIS:   Eliwood!
ELIWOOD:  Lyndis? Something the matter?
LYNDIS:   I was watching your swordplay just now.  You're quite good.
          I had no idea you could handle a sword so well.
ELIWOOD:  I've had my share of practice.  Just...I'm not sure how
          well it will serve me in real battle.
LYNDIS:   Where did you learn that style?
ELIWOOD:  My father taught me the basics.  Then, I recieved some
          instruction from Marcus.  I spar once every two months with
          Hector, too.
LYNDIS:   Sparring, huh? Interested in a new partner?
ELIWOOD:  Who, you? I don't have a problem with that.
LYNDIS:   Just so long as you don't go easy on me.  I'm very serious
          when I spar.  Wouldn't want you to get hurt.
ELIWOOD:  Of course, I understand, I'll be ready.

LYNDIS:   Eliwood, you're well informed about the other lords of Lycia, are you
          not? Are there any lordlings close to my age, besides you and Hector?
ELIWOOD:  Of course.  There's quite a few.
LYNDIS:   Then, some are women, I take it? If they enjoyed swordplay as much as
          I do, we'd become fast friends.  What do you think? Know anyone?
ELIWOOD:  Hmm... Let me see...
LYNDIS:   Someone skilled in the spear, or axe, or bow would be fine, too, of
          course.
ELIWOOD:  I don't know any ladies skilled in the martial arts.  Most of them
          never leave the castle, for that matter.  The only time I see them
          are at the banquets and such.
LYNDIS:   Banquets...I see.  Those are no place for someone from the plains,
          like me.  Oh well... Chancellor Reissmann tells me I need to learn
          manners.  I have to attend all these affairs in place of my ill
          grandfather, you see.  The chancellor doesn't think I act enough like
          a lady of Caelin.  That's why I was hoping to find a lady that could
          teach me.
ELIWOOD:  You've got your work cut out for you.
LYNDIS:   Say, could you teach me, Eliwood? Teach me how to act like a lady!
ELIWOOD:  You think I know!?
LYNDIS:   ...No, I guess you wouldn't.  Ahhh... My grandfather must be vexed
          to have me as a grandchild.  My late mother was gentle, well mannered,
          and beautiful...
ELIWOOD:  Well, you're beautiful, Lyndis.
LYNDIS:   Wha--? E-Eliwood! What did you--?
ELIWOOD:  Yeah, when we were sparring this last time, I was thinking... The way
          you move, so like the wind.  It was like watching a beautiful dance.
LYNDIS:   oh! My swordplay is beautiful... Right, you have leave to say that.

LYNDIS:   Say, Eliwood.
ELIWOOD:  Ah, Lyndis! You've gotten much better since our last match. I'll have
          to do my best not to fall behind!
LYNDIS:   Yes, well... about sparring... I was wondering if you might not teach
          me something else?
ELIWOOD:  Something else?
LYNDIS:   Yes, well, you know! Even if you can't teach me about being a lady,
          there is much to learn...
ELIWOOD:  Manners and such? That's fine by me, but I think you're worrying too
          much. You should relax, take it in stride.
LYNDIS:   Yes, but I have so far to go! I'm not like a lady at all. My
          grandfather took me in, a mixed-blood child, but I fear the other
          nobles of Lycia will not be so accepting. I do not want the Sacae
          blood in my veins to bring my grandfather shame.
ELIWOOD:  Hmph. You sound shy--Nothing like the Lyndis I know!
LYNDIS:   What?
ELIWOOD:  When I first saw you in Khathelet, I thought, what strength she has
          in her eyes, that woman. I seem to remember, Lyndis, back then, you
          didn't know what to think about your noble Lycian blood, but the
          Sacae blood in you... for that, you had nothing but the purest pride.
          Remember how you felt. You don't have to be like anyone else, Lyndis.
LYNDIS:   ... ... Yes...you're right. I guess... I guess I lost myself. Thank
          you, Eliwood. I feel better, somewhat.
ELIWOOD:  No need to thank me.
LYNDIS:   When I was on the plains, I used to despise the nobility. But I've
          changed. I think it happened a year ago, when I met you. You...you
          believed in me. You helped me.
ELIWOOD:  Hey, I wouldn't have made it this far without your help, too. You
          are my good friend. This is what friends do! Now, shall we?
LYNDIS:   Let's go!

HECTOR:  Yup.  What of it?
LYNDIS:  I was wondering whether you'd spar with me, too?
HECTOR:  You? I recommend against it.  i wouldn't want to leave a scar on a

HECTOR:  Nah, this isn't about being a man or a woman.  Just...my armor's
         heavy riding armor, see?  A swordsman such as yourself wouldn't
         stand a chance.
LYNDIS:  My! I see.  I get it.  So you've judged my strength already, then.
HECTOR:  that's not what I'm saying! Oswin once taught me during training

LYNDIS:  Well, you'd think I was a monster come to eat you! Say, did you ever
         write that letter?
WIL:     Actually, that's what I was about to do, you see...
LYNDIS:  Wil!
WIL:     Ayee! H-Hey! It's tough, you know! I mean, I haven't been home in five
         years.  What do I say?
LYNDIS:  Five years!?
WIL:     Yes, well, a lot has happened...
LYNDIS:  But when I met you in Bern, didn't you say you were on your way home?
WIL:     Ah... You remember that?
LYNDIS:  Wil!
WIL:     C-C'mon, give me a break! Why should I go home? My parents don't care
         either way.

WIL:     Huh?
LYNDIS:  Nothing.  ...Sorry for pushing you so.

WIL:     Lady Lyndis, about that letter...
LYNDIS:  It's OK.  Really, you don't have to write one.
WIL:     I-I must apologize! I didn't know about your parents... I'm afraid I
         have been most unforgivably rude!
LYNDIS:  ... ...
WIL:     Actually...I ran away from home.  Together, with a friend... Five years
         ago.  We had a plan, the two of us.  We'd get lucky, make a fortune.
         Both our families'd live in happiness.  That was our dream... But
         things didn't work out that way, of course.  My friend went back home
         after only a month.
LYNDIS:  ... ...
WIL:     I thought I'd never forgive him, you know? How could he do that? He
         quit halfway... How could he respect himself after that? Of course...I
         was no better.  I wandered for a few years.  Finally, I came as far as
         Bern... But nothing ever changed.  I was afraid to tell my parents,
         afraid they'd find out... After all, I was the one deserving no
         respect.
LYNDIS:  ...Nothing ever changed? I would think that you realizing your own
         mistake was a big change.
WIL:     Lady Lyndis...
LYNDIS:  It's true, Wil.  Sain often told me: "That Wil is such a miser, he'll
         not lend me one gold." "What's the point in saving all the time?
         Gold's to be spent!"
WIL:     ... ...
LYNDIS:  And Kent, too, he said: "Wil is my best student--the most attentive by
         far." "He's driven, that one..." "There's someone he wants to please by
         becoming a knight, I can tell."
WIL:     ... ...
LYNDIS:  Stay in the Knights of Caelin until you've reached your goal.  But I
         think your parents would like to hear that you are safe and well...
         More than seeing you as a knight years from now... or having you bring
         them mountains of gold...
WIL:     Lady Lyndis... I'll do It.  I'll write them a letter tonight.
LYNDIS:  Yes.  And Wil... I'm sorry for pushing you.
WIL:     Not at all! I feel like I will owe you until my dying day, Lady Lyndis.
LYNDIS:  Remember, a letter isn't enough.  You need to go home.
WIL:     Yes! I will!

LYNDIS:   Wallace.
WALLACE:  Ah, Lady Lyndis!
LYNDIS:   I wanted to thank you for fighting with us.
WALLACE:  It is nothing! I have sworn my body and blade to Caelin! It is my
          duty to aid the lady Lyndis.  Ah, I was going to ask you how the
          knights of Caelin have been doing? Have they been following the
          training courses in my "Manual of Knightly Prowess"?
LYNDIS:   Y-Yes... They're all giving it their best.  All except that one crazy
          course in which they're supposed to circle the domain at top speed...
WALLACE:  What!? Those weak-bellied wimps! How many times did I explain: Leave
          out one of the drills in the manual, and the good it has done will be
          for naught!
LYNDIS:   But they're only human! Running full speed around the domain is
          impossible!
WALLACE:  With an iron will, nothing is impossible, my Lady.  At my best, I
          circled the domain thrice, in armor!
LYNDIS:   You can't set one person as a standard for all, especially one as
          exceptional as yourself!
WALLACE:  Nonsense! Lord Hassar dismounted and ran the three laps with me, he
          did!
LYNDIS:   Wallace! You... You knew my father?
WALLACE:  I knew him well.  I knew Lord Hassar well, for he was my rival in all
          things.
LYNDIS:   Tell me! Tell me about my father!

WALLACE:  You've come so far in such a short time.  Not only have you mastered

LYNDIS:   I learned the sword... from my father.
WALLACE:  Yes, it is true that Lord Hassar was good not just with the bow, but
          with the sword as well.
LYNDIS:   I...must become stronger.  And not just for this battle... There is
          something else I must do.
WALLACE:  Perhaps, Lady Lyndis... you speak of the bandits that took your
          parents' lives?
LYNDIS:   My mother, my father... and the people of Lorca who died... With this
          sword, I'll avenge them all one day, I swear it.
WALLACE:  How saddened the marquess would be if he heard, that a lady of Caelin
          was plotting revenge...

LYNDIS:   I am sorry, Sir Wallace.  But this is something that I cannot forget.
WALLACE:  Lady Lyndis... Do you hate them-- the ones who did this to you?
LYNDIS:   Yes, I hate them.  Very much.  They took my father and mother from

WALLACE:  I haven't told you how I came to Bern...
LYNDIS:   You mean you didn't wander here by chance?
WALLACE:  No, not by chance.  I came to Bern for a reason.  I had a purpose...
LYNDIS:   A purpose?
WALLACE:  The bandits that used to live in the Taliver Mountains... They are
          no more.  I destroyed the bandits of Taliver.
LYNDIS:   ...Why!? Why did you do such a thing!? The bandits of Taliver were my
          enemies! They were mine to...
WALLACE:  ...Lady Lyndis.  I killed them--but not for revenge.  I want you to be

LYNDIS:   ... ...
WALLACE:  Lady Lyndis.  If you truely wished revenge upon them, you should be

          you.

WALLACE:  The blood of your parents flows in your veins.  That you live must
          bring them no end of joy.  But for you to be filled with such hate...
          Is this what your parents would have wished for?
LYNDIS:   But...But I... ... ...
WALLACE:  My words now might not reach you, I know that.  Still, Lady Lyndis,

SERRA:  Yeah, they haven't really gotten around yet.  But they're a big hit with
        the fashion elite.
SAIN:   Is that right? Well, Serra, you certainly have good fashion sense.  I
        still don't know very much about these sort of things.
SERRA:  But of course not! Caelin is pretty out of the way, even for Lycia! Even
        Lyn, who is just gorgeous, has zero fashion sense.
SAIN:   Ahh... How can you say that?
SERRA:  You know, Ostia is probably the center of the fashion world right now,
        so that's probably why you don't get my style.  I'm just so far ahead
        of the rest of the fashion world.

SERRA:  Hey, Sain.  So, who do you think Lyn will end up with? Lord Eliwood?
        Lord Hector, maybe?
SAIN:   Lady Lyndis? Hmmm... Why do you ask?
SERRA:  Well, you know, it's fun to guess! No matter who she chooses, it'll be
        big news throughout Lycia, right? But who? Who? Which one, do you think?
SAIN:   I think it's a mistake to restrict the contest to just those two.  Why
        this humble knight might be a suitable suitor.
SERRA:  No, not you, Sain. You're not even in the running...
SAIN:   What!? I had no idea! Could that sparkle in her eye have been nothing
        more than the reflection of my own love?
SERRA:  Yeah. I check up on these things, you know.  And according to my
        sources, the one that Lyn likes is...
SAIN:   She likes--?
SERRA:  Lord Hector, I'd say... They argue a lot, but that's the sign of
        passion! My intuition is very keen.  Personally, I'd go for Lord Hector
        anyway... I mean, he's royalty! As the heir, he'll be the future
        marquess!
SAIN:   Hmmm... Hey! Serra! Can you tell me who has eyes for me?
SERRA:  Nope, nope, nope. I know, but I won't tell.
SAIN:   But...why!?
SERRA:  Because...you hit on all the girls... And

OSWIN:    Hector may not walk the right path. The path of Eliwood may be the
          right one, but maybe our Hector can win people with his
          inventiveness. By not walking the clear path, he always forges new
          ones... In that, he has great skill.
MATTHEW:  You would say so much, Oswin? What has come over you?
OSWIN:    ...I would not trust him to act without us, but...I would not want
          to see his good qualities hindered.
MATTHEW:  Hmm, I see.
OSWIN:    But...you will never tell Hector what I have just said. It is...not
          becoming of a knight.
MATTHEW:  Heh heh... Yeah, I know.

MATTHEW:  Hey...you.
JAFFAR:   ......
MATTHEW:  You're Jaffar, right? You, uh... You're a Black Fang, aren't you?
          Did you know a girl named Leila?
JAFFAR:   ......
MATTHEW:  She was a spy in the service of House Ostia. She infiltrated Black
          Fang to get information on the enemy and...died. So, did you know
          her?
JAFFAR:   ......
MATTHEW:  Leila was the best spy we had working for us. The person who killed
          her... Even in the Black Fang, had to have been very skilled. One of
          the four assassins they call the Four Fangs... It was you, wasn't it.
JAFFAR:   ...... ...Yes.
MATTHEW:  Tsk...
JAFFAR:   ......
MATTHEW:  ...The guy who killed Leila. I know it won't be so easy to take you
          down. This is the only greeting I have for you, Jaffar. I don't know
          what Lord Hector or Lord Eliwood thinks, but you're going to pay.
          When you're dying at my hands... You remember Leila's name.

MATTHEW:  Legault. What was your nickname in the Fang? What kind of work did
          you do?
LEGAULT:  So now I'm your new hobby, is that it? You falling for me?
MATTHEW:  I'm not in the mood for your jokes. Tell me.
LEGAULT:  All right, no need to get testy. I was a member of the Black Fang
          when you could count us all on two hands. They took me in because of
          my nimble agility. In the organization, I was known as the Hurricane.
          My job, like everyone else's, was assassination. The only difference
          were my targets. I was the one charged with...cleaning house.
MATTHEW:  Cleaning house?
LEGAULT:  Yep. As the cleaner, I was responsible for for executing anyone who
          betrayed the Fang. Black Fang members never beg for mercy. They'd
          rather die than be captured. It's cause they know... What happens to
          traitors. You can never run from the cleaner. That's Fang law. I
          worked to protect that law.
MATTHEW:  Really? The Black Fang seems filled with some powerful fellows. And
          you? You don't look like much.
LEGAULT:  Yeah, but you know... People have to sleep sometime. But then you
          know all about work like that, don't you?
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  Killing the people you've lived and worked with for years. You'll
          find yourself hated pretty quickly. That's one thing that makes this
          place comfortable. I can just be a simple hanger-on. Are you
          satisfied?
MATTHEW:  ......

          away.

LEGAULT:  Hm? What, you again? More questions for me? No one trusts me. Even
          after all that rambling I did earlier.
MATTHEW:  There's one other important thing I haven't asked you. Why did you
          betray the Black Fang?
LEGAULT:  ...... Do I really have to go into all of this?
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  ...OK, I see. I like the Black Fang the way it used to be. The
          commander was a father figure, Lloyd, Linus, Jan, and Uhai... There
          was nothing to be suspicious of then. We believed in our own
          righteousness. We can't go back... Back to the good old days. You
          understand, right? Right?
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  Sonia's arrival was the beginning of the end. The change came
          slowly... The Fang rotted away bit by bit. And it was all the doing
          of one creepy villain, Nergal... The Fang changed. And as it changed,
          so did our work.
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  Those who had no taste for killing, the wounded who couldn't work...
          We started receiving orders to kill these innocents, too. So... I was
          ordered by some stranger to kill a wounded companion of mine. Her
          name was Aesha. A woman I'd work with for years.
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  She'd made a mistake, and her wound cost her her skill at killing.
          Her career as an assassin was over. But she shouldn't have to die for
          that. She could have lived in some village somewhere... She should
          have had many days of happiness ahead of her... But......
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  I, with this hand, I...took her life. That's when it started. That's
          when I started thinking about getting out.
MATTHEW:  ......
LEGAULT:  That's it. You satisfied?
MATTHEW:  ...Uhm... Legault?
LEGAULT:  Mm?
MATTHEW:  I'm sorry.
LEGAULT:  What's this? Hearing you say that just made my day.
MATTHEW:  Don't get the wrong idea. I don't trust you any more than before.
          But... Everyone's got a place in their hearts that they don't want to
          touch. ...That's it.
LEGAULT:  Eh... Matthew, you're a good kid. It's a shame to waste you as a spy.
MATTHEW:  Oh, shut up.

         Lord Hector and Lord Eliwood are on the front line.  If we, their

LOUISE:  I have traveled far and wide with Count Pent before, but I have never
         been to Sacae. Those vast plains and warm, dry winds... It sounds like
         a place of wonderful freedom. I understand people live like families
         in their tribes.
GUY:     ...Yes. My tribe is my family.
LOUISE:  Guy, why did you leave your home?
GUY:     I wanted to master the art of the sword. The warriors of Kutolah only
         ride horses and shoot bows. That is fine for some, but I far prefer
         the feel of a hilt in my hand. So I just decided, "From this day forth,
         I'm a swordsman!" And I left my tribe and began my training. That was
         three years ago.
LOUISE:  Three years, you say? Don't you miss your family, traveling alone all
         this time?
GUY:     Surely you jest! I am a proud warrior of Sacae!
LOUISE:  Hmmf. That you are, most certainly.

         though...
LOUISE:  But surely she is a fine woman.

RAVEN:      Priscilla... I am through speaking with you. I am your brother no
            longer. Please, return to Etruruia...
PRISCILLA:  No, I cannot.  No matter what you say... I cannot go home.
RAVEN:      Priscilla!
PRISCILLA:  I cannot bear to be somewhere where you are not! I love you, Lord
            Brother. I want to be with you, together. I...cannot leave your
            side.
RAVEN:      ... ...
PRISCILLA:  ... ...
RAVEN:      I see. You...were always like this, though, weren't you? So gentle
            at most times, until you got an idea in your head--then you
            wouldn't budge, no matter what people said.
PRISCILLA:  Yes... I'm afraid I caused you much trouble.
RAVEN:      Priscilla...
PRISCILLA:  Brother... Say what you will, I shall not leave. As long as you
            are here, lord Brother, so, too, must I remain.
RAVEN:      ...Understood. You win, Priscilla.
PRISCILLA:  What...?
RAVEN:      I planned to get revenge on Ostia for the destruction of House
            Cornwell. Since I cast aside the name Raymond and took the name
            Raven, revenge is all I have lived for. But...now, I have given
            that up. ...It is not right to abandon my little sister.
PRISCILLA:  Bro-- Lord Brother!
RAVEN:      That is all I have to say. Let's be off, Priscilla. You were going
            to stay by my side, were you not?
PRISCILLA:  Yes... And, Lord Brother?
RAVEN:      What?
PRISCILLA:  Thank you, Lord Brother.

PRISCILLA:  I am Priscilla. It is an honor, sir.
LUCIUS:     Lady...Priscilla...? Are you... Might you be...of House Cornwell?
PRISCILLA:  Hm? Have we met...somewhere before?
LUCIUS:     No... I have just heard your name in passing, I believe. Lord Raven
            has... Forgive me... To you, he is Raymond, is he not?
PRISCILLA:  Are you a friend of my brother, Raymond?
LUCIUS:     Yes. I served House Cornwell. Raymond has told me of you. He said
            that he once had a sister who was sent to live with the count of
            Caerleon.
PRISCILLA:  So... My brother speaks of me?
LUCIUS:     Have you seen Raymond recently?

PRISCILLA:  Lucius...
LUCIUS:     Ah, Priscilla...
PRISCILLA:  About...what I asked you earler... You said my brother spoke to
            you about me...
LUCIUS:     Yes.
PRISCILLA:  What...exactly did he say?
LUCIUS:     Ah, yes... That you were his younger sister, Priscilla, who left
            Cornwell when still young...
PRISCILLA:  And...what else does he say?
LUCIUS:     What else? That you were close as children... That you were often
            in ill health...and that you were very shy...
PRISCILLA:  Was there nothing else? For example... That I was cute when I was
            small... Or that he had made a sacred promise to me long ago... Or
            that he often thought of me after I left?
LUCIUS:     Lady Priscilla? Are you all right?
PRISCILLA:  ...Yes. It's nothing. Please forget about it. But...Lucius?
LUCIUS:     Yes?
PRISCILLA:  You are--how can I say this?--beautiful. Your face is like a
            woman's... No... Your face is even more beautiful than that of a
            woman... ...I'm sure even a few lords must have fallen for you...
LUCIUS:     You...must understand. I am...a man. As a child, I was often
            teased for my appearance, and I have never once profited from it.
            Perhaps you meant to imply...otherwise?
PRISCILLA:  ...... I meant nothing. I... You must excuse me...

LUCIUS:     Lady Priscilla...
PRISCILLA:  Lucius... What is the matter...? You look so serious...
LUCIUS:     Forgive me, ...Lady Priscilla. You are a noble of House Cornwell.
            I apologize for my rudeness earlier...
PRISCILLA:  Why should you apologize to me?
LUCIUS:     When we last spoke... I said some things...that I thought may have
            offended you.
PRISCILLA:  You did...no such thing. Did you come all the way here just to
            apologize to me?
LUCIUS:     I am in the service of House Cornwell. I should think of you as my
            liege.
PRISCILLA:  But now I claim House Caerleon. House Cornwell is...no more.
LUCIUS:     ...... Yes... So...you know.
PRISCILLA:  So you tried to spare my feelings by not telling me? And even after
            the disgrace of Cornwell, you still choose to stay by my brother's
            side?
LUCIUS:     Yes...
PRISCILLA:  I can see why you were such an indispensable member of House
            Cornwell. So...I think you have no need to apologize as a vassal
            would...
LUCIUS:     Lady Priscilla... Can you please tell me something? Why, when we
            last met...
PRISCILLA:  Yes, I... Please do not trouble yourself over it. I was merely
            perturbed by some trivial matter... I mean...you...
LUCIUS:     Yes?
PRISCILLA:  I left House Cornwell when I was only six years old... And how long
            were you in service to Cornwell?
LUCIUS:     That would be some ten years now. When Cornwell was torn asunder
            two years ago, Lord Raymond and I joined the Caelin army as
            soldiers for hire.
PRISCILLA:  Yes... You see? You went to Cornwell after I left. And you have
            been with my brother ever since... I had only six years with him,
            but you have had more than ten. I am a little...jealous.
LUCIUS:     Ah...Lady Priscilla...?
PRISCILLA:  ...It is nothing. Forget it.

ERK:        Eh? Ah, yes, she was. She certainly thought of herself as one.
PRISCILLA:  She was young?
ERK:        To look at her, she was no younger than you or I, Lady Priscilla.
            But I'm afraid she was no where near as mature. But why do you ask?
            It's not something I like to think of much...

PRISCILLA:  Yes. It was accused of stealing funds from the alliance and
            censured by the council of lords, stripped of its peerage.
OSWIN:      ...Yes. It is true.

PRISCILLA:  ......
OSWIN:      ...Forgive me.
PRISCILLA:  ...Why do you apologize?
OSWIN:      I should never have told you about your parents.
PRISCILLA:  When they were divested of their peerage...my mother and
            father...took their own lives. You only told me...what I asked to
            hear. Lord Oswin, you are not to blame.
OSWIN:      ......
PRISCILLA:  But...I wanted to ask my father one thing. Why...did he...have to
            steal?
OSWIN:      My lord, Uther of Ostia, investigated the matter. He...entrusted
            me...with some details. In recent years, the Cornwell fortune had
            begun to decline. Marquess Cornwell, in acts of kindness, had
            assumed the debts of many close to him. When he could not pay his
            own debts, the wolves came out.
PRISCILLA:  But...if it was a matter of money, why couldn't they ask my adopted
            family, the Caerleons?
OSWIN:      The amount they stole was...far greater than they owed. Your
            parents did not want to involve the daughter they had sent away.
PRISCILLA:  Father... ...Mo...ther......
OSWIN:      ......
PRISCILLA:  ...Lord Oswin... ......I... I...will be fine... There is no need
            to stay at my side...away from your charge...
OSWIN:      Lord Hector...gave me leave to come. I must express my regret for
            what our Ostia has done to House Cornwell. The marquess did commit
            a grave crime. But the vilest sin was the issue of the order...that
            caused so much grief. If he had stayed alive, perhaps much calamity
            could have been avoided.
PRISCILLA:  ...No matter what we say, the dead will not return... But as long
            as I will live, I will remember that you...that Ostia...were honest
            and just...

PRISCILLA:  What happened?
SAIN:       While trying to protect you, Princess, I have suffered a severe
            wound. I beg you, Princess, can you not heal me with your shining
            staff and loving heart?
PRISCILLA:  You really are hurt, right? You're not just making this up, are you?
SAIN:       O-Of course not! How could your Sain ever lie to you?
PRISCILLA:  Well, it's just that you've already done this six times... Like
            when you suffered a "terrible" sunburn? When the cold turned your
            lips blue?
SAIN:       This time is for real, I swear it!
PRISCILLA:  Fine, fine. Just lie still here...
SAIN:       Ahh...
PRISCILLA:  ...I meant to ask you this earlier, but... Sain...should you not be
            fighting at Lady Lyndis's side in battle? She is the liege you are
            bound to protect, am I right?
SAIN:       Have no fear! She has given me her leave! I am now in your service,
            beautiful creature! That is, of course, if you would have me!
PRISCILLA:  Well, I guess I don't mind, but...
SAIN:       Y-You don't!?

PRISCILLA:  Is that...true?
SAIN:       Of course it is!
PRISCILLA:  But... When this journey ends, you will leave, correct?

SAIN:       ...Yes. I am a Lycian knight. And my loyalty as a knight must be
            unwavering... But, Princess...
PRISCILLA:  ...I understand. The time you spent at my side on this journey... I
            thank you for every minute of it. You may not have noticed, but...
            You made me very...happy.
SAIN:       Princess... I...

LOWEN:    I am full of vigor! If only my skill matched my enthusiasm today.
          Lord Marcus reprimanded me several times during our march.

KENT/HEATH     B RANK     CC052

KENT:   Lord Heath... Forgive my impertinence, but I must ask you something.
        Why did you have to leave the knights of Bern?
HEATH:  ...Well, that is impertinent...
KENT:   Forgive me. But as the commander of Caelin's knights, it is my duty to
        test the loyalty of any new recruit, to learn about his past...
HEATH:  What!? You are the commander? You are quite...young.
KENT:   Lord Heath, please help me to understand. The wyvern riders of Bern
        are considered to be the strongest knights in the land. Surely we Lycian
        knights would fall to their lances if we met them head on... So why
        would you leave Bern for Lycia?
HEATH:  ...Bern is not as it once was. Our sovereign has imprisoned all those
        nobles who do not meet his favor. And their fabled power is a feeble
        joke. The only real strength of Bern's knights these days is in their
        boasting. And their general is good for nothing but wagging his tail
        at the king.
KENT:   .....
HEATH:  There was an uprising on our frontier, a rebellion of sorts. The knights
        were ordered to put it down and kill the rebels. Our commander went to
        scout out the enemy camp. This "uprising" was nothing more than a group
        of unarmed peasants.
KENT:   I see...
HEATH:  Then I heard the truth from our commander. One of our generals had
        drummed up a fake rebellion to enhance his military career. These people
        did not want to fight. They ran at the mere sight of us. Then, the
        famous wyvern riders of Bern rained savage death down upon these
        innocents.
KENT:   .....
HEATH:  My unit tried to stop them. We were all condemned to die for our
        treason. However, our general spread the story that we were to be
        hanged for slaughtering innocent lives. Before they could round us up,
        we decided to turn our coats and run. One of us stayed behind as a
        decoy, and the rest fled for the border. After that, we dispersed. All
        have been killed now, except for me. Are you satisfied now?
KENT:   ...I see. So, Bern...
HEATH:  Bern is nothing to me... I have no love for a country that slaughters
        its own. Kent, what about your liege? Would you give your life in this
        lord's service?
KENT:   Yes. It is a knight's honor to swear his fealty and his life. My
        happiness is to serve.

KENT:   Heath, it is good to have you with us.
HEATH:  ...It is just as you said. I don't know about the marquess of Caelin,
        but this Lady Lyndis is just as you said.
KENT:   Yes, she is. She is wise, kind, beautiful, and strong. She is honorable,
        and her vassals can never forget the modest kindness with which she
        treats them all...
HEATH:  ...Well, you may be laying it on a bit thick... But I really do envy
        you... Finally, I have met a master to whom I can swear my true loyalty.
KENT:   If you wish it, we will fight together under the same command! I have
        long anticipated that you would join us.
HEATH:  Yes... Perhaps I shall... I could never imagine that with the Caelin
        knights under your command, I would meet that same sorrow as I did with
        Bern... When this battle ends, let us discuss it further...

MARCUS:    Well...
MERLINUS:  Sir Marcus...are you entirely satisfied with this duty...? Guarding
           the transporter must be rather dull...
MARCUS:    Not at all. This has been a very important duty that has been

           duties faithfully.
MERLINUS:  Hmm... I see... Well, Sir Marcus, would you like to try one of

           And the distinctive taste of apples stewed in honey reminds me of a

           relying too much on the sweetness to carry the weight of this

MERLINUS:  Well, I may not know much about military organization, but...
           Shouldn't we be more involved in the decisions being made?
MARCUS:    Why do you say that?
MERLINUS:  Well, Lord Hector, Lord Eliwood and Lady Lyndis are still so young...
           Is it really all right to leave the leadership decisions to Lord

REBECCA:  What!?
DART:     I don't have any memories of my life more 'n five years back...
          Fargus found me, bloody and limp on a pier, and I didn't know who I

DART:     It's just strange luck, that. Unless...there's more to it.

HEATH:    Looks like you're still alive.
LEGAULT:  Can't complain.
HEATH:    Legault, what is it that you want from me?
LEGAULT:  Hmm... One reason is self-interest. Whether I'm working in this army
          or I'm dodging Black Fang pursuers, it makes sense to have a wyvern
          rider close at hand. Few soldiers can match your ferocity on the field.
          Of course, it does complicate matters that you are pursued.
HEATH:    I imagine so. I'm being hunted by my homeland. There's a price on my
          head. Being close to me isn't like lying in a bed of roses.

LEGAULT:  Yep. They use darkness to catch their targets unaware, use poison,
          work in groups... They can't win if they fight fair, so they use
          trickery. In a fair and open duel, a knight would crush an assassin.

ISADORA:  ...I've confidence in the techniques I practiced as a knight in
          Pherae, but you cannot predict what will occur in real battle.

ISADORA:  This army reminds you of the Black Fang?
LEGAULT:  Yep. Don't believe me? The old Fang was filled with vagrants and
          misfits. The commander would teach them how to live. Of course,
          being an assassin's not a job to brag about, but everyone had a
          kind of pride in what they were. They could at least say that they
          were right. That what they did wasn't wrong.

ISADORA:  Wha-- What are you... This is so...

          from time to time think about your love. We are all--and this
          includes you knights, too--human. Living just for battle seems

DART:   ......
GEITZ:  You know, all this time, I've resented it.  You just...you had so much

DART:   ......
GEITZ:  We first met in Badon, remember? Fargus had raided my family's boat.
        Dad and I... We went to get new freight and a new crew... When Dad was
        haggling, I saw some pirates... Compared to out ship, theirs was a total

DART:   Of course it did! That ship was our pride and joy!

GEITZ:  ..... Have you ever heard of a boat called a galley?
FIORA:  No, I haven't.
GEITZ:  Most boats use wind power to sail, right? You can move quickly with
        the wind, but you can't move against it. Well, a galley is a boat moved
        by people rowing oars. It's good for keeping a shipping schedule
        regardless of the wind.
FIORA:  And that's...
GEITZ:  Yes, my father used his profits to hire many rowers. They spent their

        I saw...children... who were my age...

          terribly angry...
WALLACE:  Yes.  He was usually warm and kind, but his demeanor changed entirely
          when it came to Lady Madelyn's welfare.  I was ordered to bring them
          both back.  I was told to resort to force against Hassar if he
          resisted.
KENT:     That is quite a shock... I cannot imagine such an order from our kind
          lord now...
WALLACE:  I accepted my orders and set out to find them... Lady Madelyn was not
          accustomed to hard travel, and I found them soon... But I could not
          take them.
KENT:     Why is that?
WALLACE:  They both said the same thing.  Each said, "I am to blame.  Do not
          harm the other."
KENT:     ......
WALLACE:  In the end, I closed my eyes and let them cross the border... I told
          the marquess that they eluded me.
KENT:     You disobeyed an order from your liege?!
WALLACE:  ...Yes, and I spent six months in the dungeon for it... Considering
          his anger at the time, he was probably being lenient with me.
KENT:     But why did you do it? I can certainly understand it must have been
          a hard order to follow, but... to disobey your lord is unthinkable
          for a knight...
WALLACE:  So it is.  But what would you have done? Would you have dragged Lady
          Madelyn back to the castle, ending their chance for love? She might
          have taken her own life if faced with such grief.  And Lady Lyndis
          would never have been born...
KENT:     No...
WALLACE:  When the marquess fell ill last year, Lundgren seized power in Caelin.
          What would you have done then? Would you have served Lundgren because
          you had sworn fealty to Caelin?
KENT:     ......
WALLACE:  For knights in the service of a lord, an order is absolute.  But a
          knight does not follow orders blindly.  before obeying, a knight
          should always consider whether the order serves the lord who gives it.

PENT:     What don't you understand?
HAWKEYE:  You people do not seek out battle... But when magic is involved, you
          become ravenous beasts.  Why is that?
PENT:     Is that how we seem? Strange.  But you are right, we do not seek out
          battle... Still... The concern over magic... It does drive people a
          bit mad.  And the greater the power of that evil, the more it sucks
          into its maw.
HAWKEYE:  ......
PENT:     Hawkeye, I am fine.  I will not lose myself into that great dark
          force.
HAWKEYE:  I believe you.  But magic and knowledge have been the end of many men.
          And it could be the end of you... or me.

PENT:   Fiora...
FIORA:  Forgive us, my lord.  We were not strong enough... We were ambushed on
        the Dread Isle, and the mission ended in failure... But Lord Eliwood did
        lend his aid, and we were able to gain some information... Allow me to
        give you the details...
PENT:   Fiora, please... Don't worry about that for now... It is I who should
        apologize...

PENT:   I understand you lost companions on Valor... It is my fault.  I should
        have provided better information.  I had no idea there was such danger.
FIORA:  no, my lord.  It was carelessness that invited danger.  My own.  There

PENT:   Canas!
CANAS:  Afternoon, Lord Pent!
PENT:   Here is the book I borrowed.  It was truly fascinating!
CANAS:  I am glad it pleased you.
PENT:   I have collected a great number of books on elder magic, and I thought
        I had read them all... But to find one of such high quality that I did
        not know of...
CANAS:  ...I do believe this is the last surviving copy of this book.  ...As I
        told you before... Knowledge of the ancient magics has been passed down
        in our family for generations... Even this book...was to be passed to
        one of my three brothers.
PENT:   And all three are now dead!! Good Lord, man, you must be...
CANAS:  Oh, no! They are alive! But...barely.  They merely subsist... As you
        know, elder magic is based on the forces of darkness... It is even more
        powerful than nature magic, which is often called anima.  But to use
        this magic, you must invite the dark forces within you.  The temptation
        to submit to the darkness is...great.  ...Unfortunately, the darkness
        took my brothers... They live...and breathe... their eyes open and
        close... But...they do not move.  And they do not speak.
PENT:   ......
CANAS:  There is no guarantee that I will not join them... ......Truthfully, it
        scares me... However, I must see the other side.  My curiosity pushes me
        even deeper.  It will be my undoing.
PENT:   This is the course of knowledge.  I am the same way...
CANAS:  I knew you would understand.  If it pleases you, keep that book.
PENT:   I cannot do that.  It is an important part of your family history!
CANAS:  Yes, but it was written by my mother.  If I ask her, she will write it
        again...
PENT:   ...Unbelieveable.  Are you telling me that this book was written by
        someone still alive!? Your mother... How could...
CANAS:  Her name is Niime.  She is an odd character.  She is known to some as
        the Mountain Hermit...
PENT:   Canas! You are the son of Niime!?
CANAS:  ...You know of her?
PENT:   Every mage knows of Niime the hermit!! ...So you are the hermit's
        child... That is...remarkable...
CANAS:  What is the matter?
PENT:   You must excuse me! My lady wife, Louise, will never believe this!

LOUISE:   Before Lord Pent would see them, each had to exhibit a special skill.
          Everyone was eager to demonstrate the qualities of a good wife...

          were all highborn ladies of Etruria.  They sang, danced, played music,

ERK:     L-Lady Louise, now is really not the time for such old memories...
LOUISE:  Hush... Listen.  Lord Pent had only just become a mage general then...
         and he was hardly ever home in the castle.  I was so happy to have such
         a cute young student around.  But that student shut himself away in his
         room all the time... just reading his books.  He didn't eat, he hardly
         slept, and soon, he collapsed.
ERK:     I... I remember...
LOUISE:  That's right.  You never let anyone do nice things for you, and then
         you just fall apart! But I realized as I nursed you back to health...
         You thought of us as total strangers... You always spurn those who try
         to help you most...
ERK:     N-No, that's not true! I could never think of you... of you or Lord Pent
         as strangers! ...But your love for me is so strong... Sometimes...it
         scares me, and I feel...paralyzed.
LOUISE:  Erk, loving another person gives you the greatest joy and energy! You
         are so precious to us.  From the time we met, we have all lived as a
         family... Isn't that enough for you?
ERK:     ...Yes.  It is.  You two are also... precious...to me.

NINO:    ...Jaffar.
JAFFAR:  ......
NINO:    Jaffar, can I ask you something?
JAFFAR:  What is it?
NINO:    ...Well, um... Why were you... with Nergal?
JAFFAR:  ......
NINO:    When I first met you, it was after you had come with Moth--I mean,
         with Sonia and the Black Fang.  So I thought at first that you were
         with the Black Fang.  Then, my brothers told me that you had come
         with Nergal.  I had never met Nergal, but... As Nergal's servants,
         you and Sonia must have been friends, right?
JAFFAR:  ...I was selected by Nergal as a child.  He raised me to become his
         Angel of Death.  ...I...did not think.  ...I did not feel.
         I did what I was told... ...and that was all.
NINO:    ......
JAFFAR:  I entered the Black Fang with the intent of infiltrating them, of
         using them... I had heard rumors about Sonia and her daughter being
         there... That child, raised by Sonia... I thought she must be
         something like myself... But...the first time I saw you, you were with
         the Reed brothers, laughing... in that dazzling light... as if you
         belonged there...
NINO:    ......
JAFFAR:  ..I became very interested in you... When you saved my life... I
         thought I had you... But I couldn't do it... Nino, that was the first
         time I ever had...feelings...
NINO:    Jaffar...

NINO:    Jaffar!
JAFFAR:  ... What is it?
NINO:    I want you to have this.
JAFFAR:  ...What is it?
NINO:    It is my greatest treasure! Isn't it pretty?
JAFFAR:  ...Why do you give it to me?
NINO:    I want you to have it.
JAFFAR:  ...This stain on the pendant's cord... Is it blood?
NINO:    Err... Umm, yeah.  ...Is that gross?
JAFFAR:  No.  Is it very old? It does not...look like it could be your blood...
NINO:    It is... It's my real mother's.  It got there when Sonia and Nergal
         killed her...
JAFFAR:  ...Then it is a valuable keepsake.  You should keep it...
NINO:    I can't even remember my own mother's face.  Even though she died
         protecting me.  So...I don't think I deserve to keep it.
JAFFAR:  ...You were so small.  How could you have remembered her?
NINO:    Still...
JAFFAR:  ...I will just hold it, then... ... ...until you are ready.
         you're my... you are my...best friend... I will always be near you...
         You may trust this with me...
NINO:    Best friend? You really think of me that way? Jaffar...
JAFFAR:  ...Yes.
NINO:    Thank you! Thank you, Jaffar! that makes me...so happy!!

NINO:  A book? Oh, it's full of pictures!
ERK:   It was mine...a long time ago...
NINO:  So you couldn't read, either?
ERK:   No, just the opposite.  I read only the most difficult books from the

       proud and happy to be his student.  So, to gain his approval, I spent day
       and night studying, without even stopping to eat...

ERK:   Haha! No, you're right... One day I just collapsed.  I really worried my
       teacher and his wife...
NINO:  Yeah?
ERK:   And that was when my teacher bought me this picture book... He said,
       "Look, Erk, this book is filled with pictures.  There are fields of
       rolling, green grass, flowers that explode into color, and clouds that
       crawl across the seamless sky.  Training to be a mage requires more than
       staying in your room studying all the time.  You must go outside and
       commune with the spirits.  When you get better, we'll go for walks
       everyday.  Until then, look at these pictures and think of how it will
       be."
NINO:  Commune with the spirits... I do that a lot.  My mother just used them,
       and always said that talking to them was a waste of time, but... But it
       sounds like your teacher really got to know them.  Eheheh.  This makes
       me so happy...
ERK:   ...You never cease to amaze me, Nino.  It's as if you were born to do
       magic.  You remind me of my teacher...
NINO:  Of your teacher!? Oh, no way!! Even as a joke, that just sounds like an
       insult to your teacher!!
ERK:   Nino, why do you doubt yourself so?
NINO:  Because... My mother said......
ERK:   Forget about that!! I believe in you!! Don't you trust me?!
NINO:  Erk...?
ERK:   ...Ah... I, ahh... ......Never mind.

        heart.  This magic makes us feel free... The elder magic that I use
        requires great strength to master its forces.
NINO:   Yeah, I think I understand... Sometimes, you look a little scary when
        you use magic...
CANAS:  When I show my son the dark tomes, he just becomes frightened and
        cries... Perhaps our ancient lineage of dark mages will end with me...
        My mother has tried all sorts of hexes to prepare the child, but nothing
        works...
NINO:   Hmmm... Is that so? And how old is he?
CANAS:  He will be two this year.
NINO:   What, he's not even two years old! What were you thinking! I'm 14, and I
        still can't read!
CANAS:  Hmmm, maybe you are right.  I guess my mother did pressure me a bit much
        as a child... But my brothers and I were all raised that way and we seem
        to have turned out well...
NINO:   You've got to be kidding! Tell her to stop right away!

        just return home now...
NINO:   Canas!!
CANAS:  Y-Yes?
NINO:   You shouldn't waste your time wandering when your son is at home waiting

NINO:   Canas! Let me introduce my family.  Just open this pendant, here.
CANAS:  All right... Now, who's this?
NINO:   That's my mother and father.  I'm in the middle.  The ones on the side

CANAS:  ...What a lovely family.
NINO:   Yeah.  And their names are printed there, see? My father's name is Juge,

NINO:   How so?
CANAS:  Well, my wife had a sister named Iris.  Unfortunately, I heard that she
        had died...
NINO:   Really? Well, you don't suppose...
CANAS:  Perhaps.  You know, Nino, you might be our niece...
NINO:   So my mom's sister... Does that make you my uncle?
CANAS:  Well, it is not an uncommon name, but... Well, perhaps... It would be an
        interesting coincidence...
NINO:   Hm.  I hope it is true... Because, Canas, you are a really good person...
        You're warm and kind, like my real dad.
CANAS:  And I would certainly ne happy to have such a studious young girl like

LEGAULT:  Well, the Angel of Death.  I've not seen you in some time.
JAFFAR:   ...... Hurricane...
LEGAULT:  I was shocked to see you fighting with this rabble.  I never thought
          to see Nergal's right-hand man here.
JAFFAR:   ......
LEGAULT:  The Black Fang's finished, isn't it.  The commander's dead.  The Four

          how does that make you feel, Angel of Death?
JAFFAR:   ......
LEGAULT:  It's true... No point in talking to you, is there? It's just like your
          friend Sonia said: you truly are soulless.
JAFFAR:   ......
LEGAULT:  You know me.  You know my strength.  You know how I fight.  What are
          you going to do? You know if you can kill me or not.  But you don't
          know me at all.  What I like, what I dislike.  The kind of life I've
          led up until now.  You don't know, and there's no reason for you to
          know.  To an assassin, it's all so much useless information.
JAFFAR:   ......
LEGAULT:  There were countless corpses stacked one on top of the other... And
          there, atop the bodies, they found a lone infant sleeping... You.
          You are death incarnate.  You feel nothing, fear nothing, desire
          nothing... You kill.  Nothing more.  Angel of Death... The perfect
          name.

LEGAULT:  What? One surprise after another.  Are you worried about the girl?

          sorrow, anger, dread... And yet, I am...afraid.  That I should die,
          that I should leave Nino alone.  That frightens me.
LEGAULT:  Oh! You... Ah, now I see... You don't speak, you don't smile, and

          Now, you have a fatal chink in your armor.  You've become human, but

VAIDA:    Shut up! Don't bother me with details! Yet, still... Like you said,
          seeing each other fight up close changes one's perspective, doesn't
          it? I got a good look, and you actually do have some skill with that

          from a weak country...
WALLACE:  Yes! As you should! ...And well, I guess your fighting doesn't leave
          too much to be desired, either.
VAIDA:    But this is far from over! Thw wyvern riders of Bern sit atop the heap
          of all other forces on the continent! You will see our power soon!
WALLACE:  Hah! I do believe that is my line! By the honorable name of Caelin, we

BARTRE:   I am Bartre! I strive to be the best! What say you to a match?

          myself?
BARTRE:   So not try to hide your skill from me, man! You may say mass on

RENAULT:  ...You are wrong about me.
BARTRE:   You don't fool me! I can spot a true warrior! Why, of the last ten men

RENAULT:  Ahh... Sort of... I guess.

RENAULT:  I'm sorry, but... I don't think I'm worthy of being called a bishop.
          Long ago, I was a mercenary.  I led a bloody, thoughtless life,
          unconnected to the holy teachings.
ISADORA:  Is that so?  And then...what brought you to the light of Elimine?
RENAULT:  I...lost a friend.  A man I could have called brother.  But when he
          died, I knew nothing of prayers, of forgiveness.  I only knew how to
          bash another man's skull... So I cast aside my weapons and knelt for
          the first time... to mourn my fallen friend.

RENAULT:  Confession... I am not so good at these priestly matters.
ISADORA:  Please, do this for me...
RENAULT:  ...Very well.  If all I must do is listen... I do not mind.
ISADORA:  Your Excellency... I was born as the youngest daughter of a country
          nobleman.  I wanted to become a knight from my earliest childhood, so
          I spent many long, bitter hours in training... I hoped to someday
          protect my country proudly... But... There was one thing for which I
          was not prepared... To protect, one must do battle with one's
          enemies... And to do battle with one's enemies, one must...strike
          ...those enemies.
RENAULT:  ......
ISADORA:  I have taken many lives in battle before now... For justice, for

          Nergal.
RENAULT:  ......
CANAS:    Why, for example, did he begin creating morphs? After his falling out
          with the Archsage Athos, did he feel alone in the world? Did he need

          Knowledge...is the reason for my journey... I understand there are

          not answer if you do not wish to.

          you were there.  Nergal was alone after he and Athos separated.  The
          only ones around him were his morphs... Perhaps then, you are...

RENAULT:  ...That is not a bad answer.  Your reply deserves another good
          answer... When Nergal first created his morphs, he was not alone.  He
          had one assistant.  A mercenary who wanted desperately to bring back
          a friend he had lost in battle.  This mercenary volunteered freely for
          Nergal's experiments, knowing they would make him less than human...

         sideways!
FARINA:  So I guess my 20,000 gold wage really is the highest here... Well, who
         should be surprised? I am quite simply the finest mercenary that money
         can buy...
DART:    Hah! 20,000 gold! You put your life on the line for that chump change!?
         Man, oh, man... Some people just go stupid for cash...

DART:    Haw! You want to know? I'm here for me!! I'm a big guy, and I've got

FARINA:  All right, I'll bite.  What's your dream, big guy?
DART:    Well, it's this...
FARINA:  Whoo, that smells musty... What is it?
DART:    Don't get all squeamish on me, now, girlie.  It's a treasure map...
         It belonged to the legendary pirate king, Han Gak.  If I can just
         decipher the riddles he used to mark the location of his buried
         treasure, then I should be able to find it...
FARINA:  So...treasure, huh? How much do you think it's worth?
DART:    Well, at least one hundred million, I'll wager...
FARINA:  That much, huh? ...... Wait a second!! Did you just say ONE HUNDRED
         MILLION--?
DART:    Whoa!
FARINA:  Now...is that thing for real!? You wouldn't lie about money, right!?
         Tell me you wouldn't!!
DART:    Now hold on, relax, just calm down... It's the real thing, I swear.
FARINA:  I can't believe it... I mean, just think... But wait... how would a
         wharf rat like you get hold of something like that?
DART:    ...Wharf rat?
FARINA:  Right, forget about it... But let's just say...
DART:    Yeah?
FARINA:  That map is probably fake, but let's just say I were to buy it from
         you... How would...3,000 gold sound?
DART:    You think me daft, woman?! Who would sell their dream for a few
         clinking coins in their pocket!? My answer is no, whatever the price.
FARINA:  But...it's so obviously a fake!!
DART:    What!? Open your beady little eyes and look here, missy! The pirate
         king signed his mark, right here!
FARINA:  Where? Mmm... Anyone could have written that!
DART:    Shut yer trap! Compare it to the one on this letter of his... Ha! Now,
         you see it, don't you!
FARINA:  Haha... Sucker... Thanks for the look at the map... I think I'll just
         go find it myself!
DART:    Nggh! you gold-snatching witch! Well, all I have to do is decipher the
         riddle before she does... And I'll find that treasure first! Or my name
         isn't Dart!

FARINA:  "The treasure lies on the other side of the door that separates fire
         and water." Fire and water, huh? The Nabata desert, maybe?
DART:    Don't you wish! See! That's why it's going to take a pirate's mind to
         unravel this one, lassie! It's got to be the Dragon's Gate on the Dread
         Isle!
FARINA:  Really? That doesn't sound right for some reason...
DART:    Yeah, well maybe that's because you weren't paying attention to this
         bit that says "The hidden white fang..." That's gotta be the Ilian

FARINA:  No way.  There are no wyverns in Ilia...
DART:    A-Are you serious? Then that would mean... Aww...
FARINA:  Just so we're straight, it's going to be "early bird gets the worm,"

DART:    You think I'd let a gold-snatching witch like you beat me to it?
FARINA:  What?! Don't act like you're not in it for the treasure, too! You find
         that treasure, and you'll be rich, right? You've got all these grand
         dreams, but you're just in it for the loot!
DART:    Don't be a bleeding idiot... Dart the pirate is not such a small man!
         Being rich is boring! My dream is this: I want to find that treasure,
         hide it again, make a map that leads to it, and pass out a few copies
         all over the world!!
FARINA:  What?!
DART:    Don't you get it? I'm a pirate's pirate! There'll be sea dogs the world
         over looking for the treasure of Dart, the legendary pirate king! What
         do you think? Isn't it exciting?
FARINA:  ...You are the stupidest pirate I have ever met...
DART:    Hey! Are you stomping on my dream?!
FARINA:  Well, what do you want me to say...? Let's see...the phrase "pearls
         before swine," comes to mind... Aww, forget about it.  I'm going to
         find that treasure first anyway...
DART:    Over my dead body! You'll never get that treasure!

HECTOR:  Hey, Farina! Wait up!
FARINA:  What? Ah, Lord Hector.  I was just off to do battle worthy of my
         purse...
HECTOR:  Yeah, about that purse.  I heard about the going price for Ilian
         mercenaries from a henchman...
FARINA:  ...Eh?
HECTOR:  Usually, they get paid by the battle, with no bonuses or anything.
         And...he said 20,000 gold is way, way too much.
FARINA:  But...
HECTOR:  Payment is determined by rank within the knightly order, right? At
         your level of ability, I'd say you're worth 2,000 gold, tops.
FARINA:  Never! I'm at 4,000 gold, I am!
HECTOR:  What's that? 4,000?
FARINA:  Er...
HECTOR:  So what was all that about 20,000 gold, eh? Trying to pull one on me,
         weren't you!
FARINA:  N-No, not at all--never! I'd never do that! It's just, I've been
         underpaid compared to my ability until now.
HECTOR:  Look me in the eye and say that again.
FARINA:  Well, and isn't this assignment a long-term one? I might need food for
         my pegasus...
HECTOR:  Right, right.  So, what does a pegasus eat? Carrots?
FARINA:  Of course not! You would treat a pegasus like a common horse?
HECTOR:  Um, it is a horse.
FARINA:  Wrong! Pegasi are noble animals! So, they must eat noble carrots, you
         see!
HECTOR:  Like I said, carrots!
FARINA:  No no no! L-Listen-- I'll do the work I've been paid for.  That should

FARINA:  Say, Karla, you're from Sacae, right?
KARLA:   Yes, you could say that... I've heard that my ancestors sailed here
         from across the seas, however...
FARINA:  So the tribes in Sacae, they all, like, dance around a fire and chant
         "Ooga Booga," don't they?
KARLA:   ...They do?
FARINA:  Don't they? You did say Sacae, didn't you? Karla, you really don't know
         much about the world, do you?
KARLA:   ...I guess I don't.  Talking with you has been very...illuminating.  I
         grew up in a place that had no contact with Sacae.  Where I grew up, I
         was not even allowed to touch a sword like this.
FARINA:  Why not?
KARLA:   Because I am a woman.  Women were not allowed to bear swords.  Women in
         my house were told to do what men say.
FARINA:  What a tired bunch of hogwash! Men aren't all that great, let me tell
         you! Unless, you know...they're rich...
KARLA:   But it was not only my country that had such rules... I have travelled
         to many lands... And most are all the same.  Farina, are things
         different where you are from?
FARINA:  Of course! Well they're the opposite anyway! Women are the only ones
         who put bread on the table.
KARLA:   Is that so?
FARINA:  Yes! Pegasi will only allow women to ride them! So only women can be
         Pegasus knights.  The men just work the terraced vegetable fields in
         the mountains.
KARLA:   I see...
FARINA:  I guess there is a men's knighht brigade, but it's pretty terrible.
         They're only really good for digging the stables out of snowdrifts
         after a storm, to be honest... So, it's kind of like men are not even
         our equals, really.  They're kind of like luggage, to tell you the
         truth.

         there no sane land in this world?

FARINA:  But that's what I'm saying! You're just so naively idealistic! I mean,
         who would do such a thing? I was just a fledgling pegasus esquire! You
         should have left me out there!
FIORA:   Farina...
FARINA:  ...But, I mean... ...I was happy, of course... So that's why--that's
         why I want to help... Here, take this...
FIORA:   Hm?
FARINA:  Look, I'm the highest-paid pegasus knight around.  It didn't take me
         long to earn that sum.  Go ahead and pay off that loan that's still
         hanging over your head!
FIORA:   Farina! You were worried about me this whole time?
FARINA:  Well, of course I was... And besides...it was my fault... And it went
         down on your permanent record and everything...
FIORA:   Don't be silly! We're family, aren't we? We shouldn't have to think
         about things like that!
FARINA:  That's what I'm talking about!! Don't be so naively idealistic!! But I
         guess that's what makes you... the sister I love.
FIORA:   Farina...

KARLA:   Yes, you could say that... I've heard that my ancestors sailed here
         from across the seas, however...

KARLA:   ...I guess I don't.  Talking with you has been very...illuminating.  I
         grew up in a place that had no contact with Sacae.  Where I grew up, I
         was not even allowed to touch a sword like this.
FARINA:  Why not?
KARLA:   Because I am a woman.  Women were not allowed to bear swords.  Women in
         my house were told to do what men say.
FARINA:  What a tired bunch of hogwash! Men aren't all that great, let me tell
         you! Unless, you know...they're rich...
KARLA:   But it was not only my country that had such rules... I have travelled
         to many lands... And most are all the same.  Farina, are things
         different where you are from?
FARINA:  Of course! Well they're the opposite anyway! Women are the only ones
         who put bread on the table.
KARLA:   Is that so?
FARINA:  Yes! Pegasi will only allow women to ride them! So only women can be
         Pegasus knights.  The men just work the terraced vegetable fields in
         the mountains.
KARLA:   I see...
FARINA:  I guess there is a men's knighht brigade, but it's pretty terrible.
         They're only really good for digging the stables out of snowdrifts

NINIAN/FLORINA     C RANK     CC070

NINIAN:   Ah...Dame Florina...
FLORINA:  You know... You really don't have to call me that.  You can just call
          me Florina.
NINIAN:   Oh... All right... Miss Florina.  Say, Miss Florina, you're from Ilia,
          right?
FLORINA:  Um, yes.  Ninian, you know about Ilia?
NINIAN:   Yes... There are white mountains covered with snow, and... I was,
          um...born there.
FLORINA:  Y-You were? Wow...you and I are from the same place, then.  That's
          funny...I fell so much closer to you now... Well, we should definitely
          talk more...
NINIAN:   Sure, that would be nice.

NINIAN/FLORINA     B RANK     CC070

FLORINA:  Um, Ninian...?
NINIAN:   Yes? What is it, Miss Florina?
FLORINA:  Can I... Can I ask you for some advice?
NINIAN:   You want to ask me for advice? What about?
FLORINA:  Well, you see, I... I'm really bad at talking to men... And I can't
          seem to even get along with all of the soldiers we fight alongside...
          So what do you think I could do to...you know, make it easier to talk
          to people?
NINIAN:   Well... I feel like you sort of... picked the wrong person to ask...
          I don' think I'm really all that good at talking to people either...
FLORINA:  Oh...all right... I just thought... You know, you're just so easy to
          talk to...
NINIAN:   Well, I feel the same way...about you.
FLORINA:  So then... We can count on each other as friends from now on, right?
NINIAN:   Yes... absolutely!

NINIAN/FLORINA     A RANK     CC070

FLORINA:  So, Ninian, where in Ilia were you born? Because... I was born in
          Edessa.  That's where the pegasi gather ...at the spring of Pyrene.
NINIAN:   I... I am not so good at geography... But it was near the tallest
          mountain in Ilia.
FLORINA:  You mean the mountain of the Ice Dragon?
NINIAN:   ...Ice Dragon?
FLORINA:  Yes.  A long time ago, there was a tall mountain where an ice dragon
          lived.  Don't you know the story?
NINIAN:   I'm sorry, I don't... I've been traveling for a long time with my
          brother, and...
FLORINA:  Oh...I see... Well, a long time ago, there was an ice dragon in Ilia.
          And this kind dragon helped the people of Ilia, who had trouble living
          in snow year round.  But a war broke out between dragons and people...
          And the kind dragons, not wanting to hurt the humans, went off to a
          faraway place.
NINIAN:   ......
FLORINA:  My sister first told me that story as a child to make me go to bed...
          Even now, every year, the people in that area make an offering to the
          mountain... When I was little, I so wanted to meet the ice dragon that
          I braved the cold and waited all night next to the place of
          offering... But I saw dawn the next morning, and the dragon never
          came... Then I caught a cold and my sister got very upset with me...
NINIAN:   ...You waited all night? Miss Florina... Weren't you afraid of the
          dragon?
FLORINA:  Afraid? Why?
NINIAN:   Doesn't everyone think that dragons are terrifying, man-eating beasts?
          I mean, how could two different species ever get along?
FLORINA:  It doesn't matter what species you are... Look at me.  My pegasus and
          I are of different species...
NINIAN:   Yeah, I guess so...
FLORINA:  Pegasi are all very shy around humans... But I'm kind of that way,
          too... At first this sweet mare and I were so afraid of each other...
          It didn't go so well... But we played together, and swam together...
          And soon, we began to understand each other... And that's how we
          became friends... So even if two beings may be shaped a little
          differently... That doesn't mean they can't get along.
NINIAN:   I see... Yeah, you must be right! I mean...we get along, don't we?

NINIAN:   ......
HAWKEYE:  You are...safe?
NINIAN:   Yes, Lord Hawkeye.  I... Thank you.
HAWKEYE:  ...You look tired.  I will ask Lord Eliwood to give you lighter
          duties...
NINIAN:   No... I'm fine...
HAWKEYE:  I see.  Then I will go.  Be careful.
NINIAN:   Yes... Excuse me, Lord Hawkeye... Thank you for caring so much
          for...someone like me.
HAWKEYE:  ...In the village, I have a daughter.  You look like you could be...
          a friend of hers...
NINIAN:   The village...?

NINIAN/HAWKEYE     B RANK     CC105

NINIAN:   Lord Hawkeye... You live in Nabata, don't you?
HAWKEYE:  Yes.  Deep within the dunes, behind the desert wind... there lies our
          home, the village of dragons.
NINIAN:   Village of...dragons?
HAWKEYE:  Our village is protected by Athos... ...It is also called Utopia.
          Humans and dragons live together ...in peace.
NINIAN:   Humans and dragons? Is...that true? Does such a place really exist?
HAWKEYE:  It does.
NINIAN:   ...... I...traveled with Nils for a long time... But I had never
          heard of it...
HAWKEYE:  The village of dragons...exists.  There are humans there, and dragons.
          There is no fighting.
NINIAN:   What... ...a wonderful place it must be.  ......Dragons... living
          with people... ...I have dreamed of it...
HAWKEYE:  ......

NINIAN/HAWKEYE     A RANK     CC105

NINIAN:   Lord Hawkeye.
HAWKEYE:  ......
NINIAN:   May I... Ask you something? I... Well...
HAWKEYE:  I know.  You need say nothing.  I have heard it from my master...
NINIAN:   From Lord Athos?
HAWKEYE:  Listen.  My master said this to me... Humans and dragons fight and
          fear one another... This has not changed for a thousand years.  Most
          humans now have never seen a dragon, but the fear still remains,
          carried down over time...
NINIAN:   Yes...
HAWKEYE:  But humans can change.  Humans live only a short time, but they can
          learn and feel much in that time.  So they can change.
NINIAN:   ......
HAWKEYE:  Humans and dragons can understand one another.  The day they will
          understand each other will come.  I believed the master when he said
          so.
NINIAN:   Yes... I... believe it, too.
