7,"Seiros: You'll die for that! Die, die! You took...everything... that I loved!"
8,"Seiros: He's gone now, Mother..."
9,Sothis: Oh my. What could have brought you here?
10,Sothis: I wonder how you got in here… It is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose. Very rude indeed. Now come to me. I wish to have a look at you.
11,"Sothis: Hmm... I have not seen the likes of you before. Who are you, anyway?"
12,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm a ghost.
Sothis: Do not deceive. You would do well to keep your wit in line. (Loops back to above choice)
Choice 2: I'm a demon.

18,Sothis: I see. Then you must have a name of sorts. Go on.
19,Sothis: Huh. I shall not ever grow accustomed to the sound of human names. You must possess a day of birth as well. Beneath which moon and on what day were you born to this world?
20,"Sothis: Well, wonders never cease! It seems we share our day of birth. How strange! Hmm. It all feels so...familiar. I think it may be time for yet another nap... It is almost...time to...begin..."
21,Jeralt: Hey. Time to wake up.
22,Jeralt: Were you having that dream again?
23,"Byleth
Choice 1: I was dreaming about a war...
Jeralt: Massive armies clashing on a vast field, right? There hasn’t been a battle like that in over three centuries…
Choice 2: I was dreaming about a young girl...
Jeralt: You’ve described her to me before. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like that."

27,Jeralt: You’ve described her to me before. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like that.
28,"Jeralt: In any case, just put that out of your mind for now. The battlefield is no place for idle thoughts. Risking your life is part of the job for mercenaries like us. Letting your mind wander is a sure way to get yourself killed."
29,"Jeralt: OK, time to get moving. Our next job is in the Kingdom. I told you before. It’s far from here, so we’ll need to leave at dawn."
30,"Byleth

31,"Choice 1: Oh, right... (Relationship with Jeralt down)"
32,Choice 2: Of course. (Relationship with Jeralt up)
33,Jeralt: Hm? Good grief. Everyone is already waiting for us outside.
34,"Mercenary: Jeralt! Sir! Sorry to barge in, but your presence is needed."
35,Jeralt: What's happened?
36,Dimitri: Please forgive our intrusion. We wouldn’t bother you were the situation not dire.
37,Jeralt: What do a bunch of kids like you want at this hour?
38,Dimitri: We’re being pursued by a group of bandits. I can only hope that you will be so kind as to lend your support.
39,Jeralt: Bandits? Here?
40,Edelgard: It's true. They attacked us while we were at rest in our camp.
41,Claude: We’ve been separated from our companions and we’re outnumbered. They’re after our lives…not to mention our gold.
42,Jeralt: I’m impressed you’re staying so calm considering the situation. I… Wait. That uniform…
43,Mercenary: Bandits spotted just outside the village! Damn… There are a lot of them.
44,"Jeralt: I guess they followed you all the way here. We can’t abandon this village now. Come on, let’s move. Hope you’re ready."
45,Jeralt: Let’s take care of those thieves before they overrun the village. Take down the enemies in front first. That should take the wind out of their sails.
46,"Edelgard: You have a strange aura about you… You say you’re a mercenary, so show me what you can do."
47,"Dimitri: Thank you. We are in your debt. It wouldn’t do for us to fall in a place like this. Please, lend us your strength. Let’s work together to drive out these thieves!"
48,Claude: It’s because of you guys that I’m not dead right now. Thanks for that! I didn’t expect to run into mercenaries like you in some remote village. The gods of fortune must be smiling on me!
49,Jeralt: We’ll advance while protecting ourselves from the enemy. Take up position inside the forest.
50,"Jeralt: Yes, good. If we’re in the forest, we can sustain their attacks without losing the advantage."
51,Jeralt: This is a fine opportunity. Use the combat arts I taught you!
52,"Jeralt: Attack when an ally is nearby, and the enemy will be intimidated, making them easier to hit."
53,Kostas: Damn. Why are there mercenaries in the village? Guess we'll have to deal with them too.
54,Kostas: What the?! Aren't you Jeralt the Blade Breaker? What's a renowned mercenary like you doing here?
55,Jeralt: I'm the one who should be complaining. I'm caught up in the mess you started!
56,"Kostas: Hey, you with the blank stare! Outta my way!"
57,Kostas: I'm gonna kill you where you stand...
58,Kostas: You'll die!
59,"Sothis: Honestly! What are you accomplishing with that little stunt?! It’s like you’re trying to get me killed, you fool!"
60,"Sothis: Well, it’s fine. After all, if you don’t know the value of your own life, you’re not going to protect it very well, are you? Course not. (Stands up.) Well then, I guess it’s up to me to guide you from now on, right? You can call me Sothis…but I’m also known as “The Beginning”."
61,"Sothis: Hmm… Sothis… Yes, that is it. My name is Sothis. And I am also called…The Beginning. But who once called me that?"
62,"Byleth
Choice 1: What are you talking about?
Choice 2: Sothis?"
63,Choice 1: What are you talking about?
64,Choice 2: Sothis?
65,"Sothis: I was not able to recall my name…until just now. And just like that, it came to me. How odd. That look upon your face… Did you think me a child? A mere child who forgot her own name?! Phooey! That “child” just saved your life! And what does that make you?"
66,"Byleth
Choice 1: I am no child.
Sothis: Ha! Such arrogance. You look the part but are you truly an adult?
Choice 2: I'm less than a child? (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: Correct! You understand."
67,"Choice 1: I am no child.

68,Sothis: Ha! Such arrogance. You look the part but are you truly an adult?
69,"Choice 2: I'm less than a child? (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: Correct! You understand."
70,Sothis: Correct! You understand.
71,"Sothis: You threw yourself before an axe to save just one young girl. Yet all is well, as I have stalled the flow of time for now. You would have died had I not intervened."
72,"Byleth
Choice 1: Thank you.
Sothis: There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all.
Choice 2: You stopped time?
Sothis: Hm. I do not hear your gratitude. Perhaps I should force you to leave? (Byleth bows) There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all."
73,"Choice 1: Thank you.
Sothis: There now. Is gratitude so much to ask? I did deem you worth saving, after all."

77,"Sothis: Though it is only momentary, time has stopped. However did I manage that..."

Choice 2: What now?"
79,Choice 1: What will happen when time resumes?
80,Choice 2: What now?
81,"Sothis: When time begins again, the axe will tear into your flesh, and you will surely meet your end. How rude of you to drag me into this! Now what to do…"
82,"Byleth
Choice 1: Turn back the hands of time. (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!
Choice 2: Keep time frozen until I'm safe.
Sothis: That is ridiculous! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!
Choice 3: I'll just stay here and wait to die. (Relationship with Sothis down)
Sothis: As though I could stand idly by and watch that come to pass! Oh, but perhaps... Of course! I must turn back the hands of time!"

89,"Sothis: Yes... I do believe it can be done. You really are quite troublesome. I cannot wind back time too far, but all is well. You are aware of what’s to come, which means you can protect yourself this time. Now, go… Yes, you who bears the flames within. Drift through the flow of time to find the answers that you seek…"
90,Edelgard: Huh?
91,Kostas: You'll die!
92,Claude: Hey–over here!
93,Jeralt: Hey... Did you just...
94,"Alois: The Knights of Seiros are here! We'll cut you down for terrorizing our students. Hey, the thieves are running away! Go after them! The students seem to be unharmed. And...who's this?"
95,Jeralt: Ugh... Why him?
96,"Alois: Captain Jeralt?! It is you! Goodness, it’s been ages. Don’t you recognize me? It’s Alois! Your old right-hand man! Well, that’s how I always thought of myself anyway. It must have been 20 years ago that you went missing without a trace. I always knew you were still alive!"
97,"Jeralt: You haven’t changed a bit, Alois. Just as loud as ever. And drop that “captain” nonsense. I’m not your captain anymore. These days I’m just a wandering mercenary. One who has work to do. Good-bye, old friend."
98,"Alois: Right... Good-bye, Captain. Wait! That isn't how this ends. I insist that you return to the monastery with me!"
99,Jeralt: Garreg Mach Monastery... I suppose this was inevitable.
100,"Alois: And how about you, kid? Are you the captain's child?"
101,"Byleth
Choice 1: He is a stranger to me. (Relationship with Jeralt down)
Alois: Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.
Choice 2: I'm a bandit. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: Great sense of humor, this one. Clearly cut from the same cloth as the captain.
Choice 3: That is correct.
Alois: Is that so? Well, physical differences aside, your mannerisms do remind me of the captain."

107,"Alois: Is that so? Well, physical differences aside, your mannerisms do remind me of the captain."
108,"Alois: I'd love for you to see the monastery too. You will join me, won't you?"
109,"Alois: What's troubling you, Captain? You aren't about to run off again, are you?"
110,Jeralt: Even I wouldn't dare run from the Knights of Seiros.
111,Sothis: The Knights of Seiros... They do seem rather skilled.
112,Sothis: Ah. It seems your presence is required. Get going!
113,"Edelgard: I appreciate your help back there. Your skill is beyond question. You’re clearly an experienced mercenary. And your father...that would be Jeralt, the Blade Breaker? Former captain of the Knights of Seiros. Oft praised as the strongest knight to ever live. Have I missed anything?"
114,"Byleth
Choice 1: The Knights of Seiros?
Edelgard: You haven’t heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of Fódlan?
Choice 2: I didn't know he was a captain. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: How curious. I’d wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed."
115,"Choice 1: The Knights of Seiros?
Edelgard: You haven’t heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of Fódlan?"
116,Edelgard: You haven’t heard of the Knights of Seiros? The most famous order of knights in all of Fódlan?

Edelgard: How curious. I’d wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed."
118,Edelgard: How curious. I’d wager the explanation for that is fascinating indeed.
119,"Claude: Hey! You are coming with us to the monastery, right? Of course you are. I’d love to bend your ear as we travel. Oh, I should mention that the three of us are students of the Officers Academy at Garreg Mach Monastery. We were doing some training exercises when those bandits attacked. I definitely got the worst of it."
120,Edelgard: That would be because you ran off.
121,"Claude: Too true! I was the first to make a strategic retreat. Everything would have worked out if these two hadn’t followed me and ruined everything. Because of them, every single one of those bandits chased after us. Utterly ridiculous."
122,"Dimitri: Ah, so that’s what you were thinking, Claude. And here I thought you were acting as a decoy for the sake of us all."
123,Edelgard: His intentions were as clear as day. You will prove a lacking ruler if you cannot see the truth behind a person's words.
124,Dimitri: Hm. You will prove a lacking ruler if you look for deceit behind every word and fail to trust those whom you rely on.
125,"Claude: Oh, joy. A royal debate between Their Highnesses. I wonder how being completely predictable affects one’s ability to wield power. Personally, as the embodiment of distrust, I’d say your little exchange smacks of naiveté."
126,"Edelgard: Me? Naïve? Tell me, are you actually incapable of keeping quiet, or is your lack of self-awareness a condition of some sort?"
127,"Dimitri: In any case, forgive our digression. I must speak with you, if you can spare a moment. The way you held your ground against the bandits’ leader was captivating! You never lost control of the situation. It showed me I still have much to learn."
128,Edelgard: Your skill is precisely why I must ask you to consider lending your services to the Empire. I might as well tell you now. I am no mere student. I am also the Adrestian Empire’s–
129,"Dimitri: Halt, Edelgard. Please allow me to finish my own proposition. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in dire need of exceptional individuals such as yourself. Please, do consider returning to the Kingdom with me."
130,"Claude: Whoa, there! You two sure are hasty. Trying to recruit someone you just met. Tactless, really. I was personally planning to develop a deep and lasting friendship on our journey back to the monastery before begging for favors. But it seems there’s no time for niceties in this world. So, capable stranger, let’s get right to it. Where does your allegiance lie?"
131,"Sothis: Hmm. It seems one's place of birth is quite significant to them. Yet they are so impressed by you, that you may take your pick. Well?"
132,"Byleth
Choice 1: Adrestian Empire: Land of Ancient History (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: A wise choice. Though the Empire has fallen from its former glory, the other regions are merely offshoots that pale in comparison.
Choice 2: Holy Kingdom of Faerghus: Land of Noble Knights (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Understood. Faerghus is a noble and distinguished kingdom that has always valued chivalry.
Choice 3: Leicester Alliance: Burgeoning League of Nobles (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: Is that right? Well, that’s a win for the Alliance, so I suppose I’m obligated to be happy."

139,"Alois: All right, that's enough with the small talk. It's time to head back to the monastery."
140,Claude: Looks like we'll have to pick this up another time.
141,"Sothis: My, my. They are in such a hurry. You know... Each of the three is most unique."
142,"Byleth
Choice 1: Edelgard… (She is a refined young woman… But I feel as though she is always evaluating me…)

147,"The icy winds of the Oghma Mountains have begun to scatter, and the verdant fields once again spring to life across Fódlan, heralding the start of a new year. As they celebrate the dawning year, the people pray that they may realize their full potential, just as a tiny sprout hopes to one day grow into a great tree.
"
148,"The continent of Fódlan, said to be protected by a revered goddess, has existed since time immemorial. Three ruling powers now control the land. In the south lies a region long held by a more than one-thousand-year-old dynasty–the Adrestian Empire. Beyond its borders, to the frigid north, is the home of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, ruled by the royal family and its knights. To the east, a league of nobles that heeds no king nor emperor rules what is called the Leicester Alliance. Once consumed by a tempest of war and turmoil, Fódlan and these three mighty powers now exist in relative harmony.

260,"Seteth: Thank you for your patience, Jeralt. My name is Seteth. I am an advisor to the archbishop."
261,Jeralt: Right. Hello.
262,"Rhea: It has been a long time, Jeralt. I wonder…was it the will of the goddess that we have another chance meeting like this?"
263,Jeralt: Forgive my silence all these years. Much has happened since we last spoke.
264,"Rhea: So I see. The miracle of fatherhood has blessed you. That is your child, is it not?"
265,Jeralt: Yes...born many years after I left this place. I wish I could introduce you to the mother of my child...but I’m afraid we lost her to illness.
266,Rhea: I see. My condolences. As for you…I heard of your valiant efforts from Alois. What is your name?
267,"Byleth:
Choice 1: My name is... (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: A fine name indeed.
Choice 2: ...
Seteth: You must at least show the basic courtesy of telling us your name! Do you not think you are being a bit rude to the archbishop?
Rhea: It is all right, Seteth. My dear, I am called Rhea. I am the archbishop of the Church of Seiros. In truth, I was only being polite. I already know your name. And a fine name it is."

273,"Rhea: From the bottom of my heart, I thank you for saving those students of the Officers Academy."
274,Jeralt: Hmph.
275,"Rhea: Jeralt. You already know what it is I wish to say, do you not?"
276,"Jeralt: You want me to rejoin the Knights of Seiros, don’t you. I won’t say no, but…"
277,"Rhea: Your apprehension stings. I had expected that Alois would have already asked this of you. I must step away for now, but I expect they will desire a word with you soon. Please listen carefully to what they have to say. Until tomorrow… Farewell."
278,Jeralt: I can’t believe it. Forced back into the Knights of Seiros. I’m sorry I dragged you into this. Looks like I’ll be stuck here for a while…and I’m afraid your services are requested as well.
279,"Byleth: (I must…work here?)
Choice 1: As a mercenary?
Choice 2: As a servant?"
280,Choice 1: As a mercenary?
281,Choice 2: As a servant?
282,"Jeralt: Nothing like that. They want you to teach, by the sound of it. You heard those brats earlier talking about the Officers Academy, right? Well, the academy just happens to be short a professor. And apparently that damned Alois went and recommended you to Lady Rhea."
283,"Manuela: So. You must be the new professor. My, how stern and handsome you are!"
284,"Jeralt: Er, no. I’m not the one you’re looking for. You can handle things from here. Good luck. (Turns to leave, and adds in a whisper) And…watch out for Lady Rhea. I don’t know what she’s thinking, making you a professor like this. She may be up to something. Stay on your guard."
285,"Manuela: Oh. It's you, then? So young..."
286,"Hanneman: Competence and age are not necessarily correlated, as you well know. I am Hanneman, a Crest scholar and professor at the Officers Academy. I wonder if you bear a Crest of your own. When next you have a moment to spare, I insist that you pay me a visit so we can delve into the subject further."
287,"Manuela: I’m Manuela. I’m a professor, a physician, a songstress, and available. It’s nice to meet you."
288,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're a physician?
Manuela: I look too pretty for that line of work, do I? But yes, when I’m not teaching, I can be found in the infirmary. If you’re ever lonely, please do come and pay me a visit. I would love to–

292,"Manuela: Of course. Before I came here, I belonged to a renowned opera company. Perhaps you've heard of me? The Mittelfrank Opera Company's beautiful, peerless–"
293,"Hanneman: Spare our colleague the needless chatter, Manuela. Now then, it seems you’ll be taking charge of one of the academy’s three houses. I expect you haven’t yet been briefed on the nature of each, have you?"
294,"Manuela: Do you really not know? Fine, I’ll do you a favor and explain. The Officers Academy is comprised of three houses of students, each of which is closely affiliated with its region of origin. The Black Eagle House is for students from the Adrestian Empire. Their house leader this year is Edelgard, the Imperial princess, who is in line to be the next emperor."
295,Hanneman: The Blue Lion House is for students from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Their house leader this year is Prince Dimitri. He is to be the next king of Faerghus.
296,"Manuela: Lastly, there is the Golden Deer House, which is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Their house leader is Claude, grandson to Duke Riegan, the leader of the Alliance."
297,"Hanneman: To think that the next emperor, king and sovereign duke are all here. It certainly is a promising year for the academy."
298,Manuela: I’ll say. I just hope none of those little treasures cause any trouble.
299,"Hanneman: Hm, quite. For now, I suggest taking a stroll around the academy to get your bearings. And when you’ve a moment, please stop by my research laboratory."
300,"Manuela: The old man has a point. Oh, and keep in mind that I’ve only notified the house leaders that you’re our new professor. It’s more fun that way. I suggest you try spending time with the students. Some odd ducks in that bunch, but they’re good kids. I’m sure Lady Rhea will have more information for you tomorrow, but that should get you going. Good luck. You’ll need it."
301,"Seteth: Have you no intention of changing your mind, Rhea? Appointing a stranger–a child no less!–as a professor at our esteemed academy is–"
302,"Rhea: I have made my decision, Seteth. I know worrying comes naturally to you, but there is truly no need. That “stranger” is Jeralt’s flesh and blood, after all."
303,Seteth: I can’t say that’s all too comforting. How trustworthy is this Jeralt character? Is he not the man who went missing after the great fire 21 years ago? I would remind you that Flayn is now here with us as well. I beg of you…please consider whether this is an unnecessary risk.
304,"Rhea: Seteth. They have my trust. Let that be enough for you as well. More importantly, I have received a report from Shamir. I am increasingly concerned about a matter regarding our suspicious individual. We cannot ignore those who harbor ill will towards the church, especially if they are frequenting Garreg Mach."
305,"Seteth: Yes, that matter is of great importance as well. I shall continue my investigation. Rhea… For now, I will have faith that you are placing your trust with the utmost care. I pray that nothing occurs to shake that confidence."
306,"Rhea: I assume you are already aware that you will be teaching here at the Officers Academy. Correct? To start, please speak with the three house leaders. You should also take a look around the academy and acquaint yourself with your new home. That is your first task here at the monastery. Please let me know if you accept it. Once you have finished, come and speak with me."
307,Rhea: You should speak with every student you can. This might be your only chance to see what they're really like before you become a professor...
308,"Rhea: (Quest completed) You are responsible for choosing which house to lead. If there are still students you have yet to speak with, try visiting each house's homeroom."
309,"Alois: Ha! I imagine you were a bit surprised that I recommended you as a professor here. Frankly, we had someone else in mind for the role, but they ran off during our dustup with the bandits. Can't entrust students to someone who's abandoned them once before, huh?"
310,"Seteth: You saved the lives of the students you came across. That, at least, was admirable. Now, you should make the rounds. Go around the monastery and see that you greet everyone."
311,"Edelgard: So you've accepted a teaching position here... Pity. I was hoping you would lend your strength to the Empire. I never properly introduced myself, did I? My name is Edelgard von Hresvelg. I am the princess and heir apparent to the Adrestian Empire. I wonder if you'll be tasked with leading the Black Eagles... I hope you've had a chance to meet everyone. Would you like to know more about any of the Black Eagles?"
312,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes.
Edelgard:
(Edelgard) Me? Well...some think I'm a bit distant. Arrogant, even. But there's little to be done. One day, I must rise to become Adrestia's next emperor. What else... Well, it seems to me that we may have similar personalities.
(Hubert) Hubert is the heir of Marquis Vestra. He has served me since I was a child. You may think his blood runs a bit cold, but... Heh, actually, that's rather accurate. Still, if you can get past that, you'll see he's quite astute and reasonable.
(Ferdinand) For some reason, he thinks of me as a bitter rival and is always trying to challenge me. It's terribly irritating. His house is that of Duke Aegir, which produces Adrestia's Prime Ministers. That family is...perhaps too pleased with its own status.
(Linhardt) He's remarkably intelligent, but he only wishes to apply himself to tasks that particularly interest him and nothing else. He's also fond of...well, napping. If he had any work ethic or sense of duty to speak of, I suppose he would be destined to become an official of the Empire.
(Caspar) He's the second son of Count Bergliez. He has no inheritance in his future, which is perhaps why he's always so eager to prove himself. He's overly energetic and rushes headfirst into any battle. If he ends up in your care, be sure to keep a close eye on him.
(Bernadetta) She's Count Varley's only daughter. I suppose you could say she's a bit eccentric, but she seems like a gentle soul. I believe she's shut herself away in her quarters and doesn't care to leave, but...don't worry. I'll make sure she finds her way to class.
(Dorothea) Few commoners have joined the Black Eagle House, but Dorothea is an exception. She's a songstress from a famous opera company in the Empire. I'm not entirely sure what brought her to the Officers Academy.
(Petra) To the west of Fódlan is an archipelago called Brigid. Petra is the granddaughter of their king. Brigid is a vassal state of the Empire, which is how she came to be enrolled here. She's incredibly smart and studious.

(Mercedes) I hear she was born to Imperial nobility, but a twist of fate brought her to the Kingdom. She may seem carefree on the surface, but she's actually a kind soul who pays careful attention to everyone around her.
(Annette) Annette is Baron Dominic's niece. She is a talented student who scored extremely high marks at the Royal School of Sorcery. She's cheerful and hardworking. Brilliant, really. Though she can be a bit oblivious at times. I hear she caused an explosion in the kitchen last night...
(Ingrid) Ingrid is Count Galatea's daughter. She is also a childhood friend of Felix, Sylvain and myself. She is diligent, industrious, and principled. In truth, she is more knightly than most knights you will ever meet.

Claude:
(Claude) (laughs) Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would have it, I'm pretty curious about you as well. But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just spend the next year or so learning about each other, little by little.
(Lorenz) He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't already picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and fancies himself a lady's man. That said, deep down he's really devoted and honest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again.
(Raphael) He comes from a merchant family, but his parents died in an accident. Seems like he's had a rough life. Despite all that, he's just about the most cheerful guy you'll ever meet. His passions are training, eating, and... Actually, that's about it.
(Ignatz) He's the second son of a merchant family. Since his brother will inherit the business, he's training to become a knight. If you ask me, doesn't seem like he truly wants to be a knight... He's probably just doing it to please his parents...
(Lysithea) Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is probably the youngest student here. But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a child. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to make your own fun in this place, you know?
(Marianne) Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...and that's pretty much all I know about her. She doesn't interact much with other students, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak.
(Hilda) Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit. If you look up ""lazy"" in the dictionary...her picture won't be there because she never got around to submitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.
(Leonie) Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary. I think she said that her father is a hunter. She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come. A habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here.

(Lysithea) Lysithea is the daughter of Count Ordelia, and is probably the youngest student here. But watch out! She gets angry if you treat her like a child. As for me, I do it on purpose. You have to make your own fun in this place, you know?
(Marianne) Marianne is Margrave Edmund's daughter...and that's pretty much all I know about her. She doesn't interact much with other students, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of folks here have never even heard her speak.
(Hilda) Hilda is the only daughter of Duke Goneril. It seems her father and brother coddle her quite a bit. If you look up ""lazy"" in the dictionary...her picture won't be there because she never got around to submitting it. Not too unusual for a noble, I guess.
(Leonie) Leonie enrolled because she wants to be a mercenary. I think she said that her father is a hunter. She's pretty blunt and as stingy as they come. A habitual saver, too. I think she's hoping to repay her village for helping to send her here."

(Claude) (laughs) Piqued your interest, have I? As luck would have it, I'm pretty curious about you as well. But what's life without a bit of mystery? Let's just spend the next year or so learning about each other, little by little.
(Lorenz) He's the heir of Gloucester territory. If you haven't already picked up on it, he's a bit arrogant and fancies himself a lady's man. That said, deep down he's really devoted and honest... Though I wouldn't mind never hearing him talk about his noble obligations ever again.

349,Choice 2: No.
350,Byleth: (I suppose I should return to Rhea...)
351,"Hubert: I am Hubert. A humble servant of Lady Edelgard. I heard you came to the aid of Her Highness. You have my most sincere thanks. This is Petra. She has come all the way from Brigid to study in the Empire. Back on her archipelago, she is actually a princess. In Fódlan terms, she would be called heir to the throne."
352,"Petra: Hello. I am called Petra. I am pleased to be meeting with-- No, I am pleased to have met you."
353,"Caspar: Is it true that you saved Edelgard? That's incredible! The name's Caspar, by the way. Pleased to meet ya!"
354,Linhardt: Linhardt. Good-bye.
355,"Caspar: Yeesh, Linhardt. How'd you get into the academy with those manners? So, are you a student here too? Maybe we'll be in the same class!"
356,Bernadetta: Ah! What?! I don't talk to strangers!
357,"Ferdinand: Bernadetta, this is no stranger! Our house leader owes this person a great debt. Is that not right? (To Byleth) I am Ferdinand von Aegir, legitimate son of the Aegir family, the Empire's foremost house. Are you going to join our class? I look forward to getting better acquainted with you."
358,"Dorothea: Well now, you don't have a familiar face. What brings you here? Oh, my name is Dorothea. Before I joined the academy, I was a member of an opera company in the Empire. You should hear me sing sometime."
359,"Dorothea: Well, aren't you just lovely. Is this your first time in the monastery? Shall I show you around? Oh, my name is Dorothea. Before I joined the academy, I was a member of an opera company in the Empire. You should hear me sing sometime."
360,Student: This classroom belongs to the Blue Lion House. Our house leader is Prince Dimitri. All of us here hail from the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus.
361,"Sylvain: Well, well! It must be my lucky day today, being approached by such a beauty. I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier. Feel free to say hi whenever you like."
362,Sylvain: Hey there. Are you the mercenary who saved His Highness? It's an honor to meet you. I'm Sylvain Jose Gautier. Feel free to say hi whenever you like.
363,Mercedes: And who's this? You don't look familiar at all. Do you work here at the monastery?
364,"Annette: Oh, Mercie! Do you think this is that mercenary people have been talking about?"
365,"Mercedes: Now that I think about it, that does sound like something Dimitri may have said... I suppose you'll be enrolling at the Officers Academy too, then? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Mercedes, and this is my best friend–"
366,Annette: I'm Annette! It's nice to meet you.
367,"Ingrid: I have heard all about what you did from Prince Dimitri. As a citizen of Faerghus, I thank you."
368,Felix: He also said you're quite skilled. And he doesn't just say things like that. I look forward to sparring with you and beating you.
369,"Ingrid: Felix, must you always speak of fighting right away? Oh! And, uh...you may call me Ingrid. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance."
370,"Ashe: Hi, there! You must be the one everyone's talking about. I'm Ashe. Great to meet you. This here is Dedue. He serves Prince Dimitri."
371,"Dedue: I have heard that you rescued His Highness. Words cannot express my gratitude. Should you ever require my strength, please know that I will hasten to repay this debt."
372,"Student: The Golden Deer House is for students of the Leicester Alliance. Our house leader is heir to the Alliance's leadership, House Riegan. We have plenty of other prominent nobles as well!"
373,Raphael: Are you someone's guest? The dining hall's that way if that's what you're looking for.
374,"Leonie: No, Raphael. That's Captain Jeralt's kid. Hi, I'm Leonie Pinelli–Captain Jeralt's first and greatest apprentice! I'm sure he's told you about me?"
375,Raphael: Nice to meet you! I'm Raphael Kirsten. Who are you again?
376,"Hilda: Hey, are you that mercenary? Everyone's been talking about you. I'm Hilda Valentine Goneril. And her name is..."
377,Marianne: M-Marianne von Edmund...
378,"Hilda: Are you joining the Knights of Seiros or something? Well, I look forward to seeing more of you!"
379,"Lysithea: So you're the skilled mercenary who saved Claude, are you?"
380,"Ignatz: Oh, you are? It's such an honor to meet you! Ignatz Victor. My parents are Alliance merchants."
381,Lysithea: And I am Lysithea von Ordelia. Please do not forget it.
382,Lorenz: Ah. You must be that renowned mercenary. Perhaps you'd like to join me for a cup of tea sometime. My name is Lorenz Hellman Gloucester. You will want to remember it.
383,"Lorenz: Ah. You must be the renowned mercenary who rescued Claude. Honestly, you should not have troubled yourself over the likes of him. My name is Lorenz Hellman Gloucester. You will want to remember it."
384,Jeritza:  What do you want?  I am Jeritza. I teach here. Weapon instruction. These are the training grounds. Good-bye.
385,"Gatekeeper:  Greetings! You must be the new professor. What a pleasure!  As for me, my job is to stand here at this glorious entrance and leisurely watch over the comings and goings of everyone. Make folks smile, you know?  Er...and by that, I mean...to vigilantly guard this entrance with my very life! No levity whatsoever. As of now, nothing to report."
386,"Jeralt: Here I am again, the office of the captain of the knights. That said, I'm merely here to assist. Apparently the current captain is getting on in years. I hear the captain has a hard time keeping up with the responsibilities of the job. (sighs) That's where I come in."
387,Hanneman: This is my research laboratory. I've worked hard to furnish it with the rare materials and purpose-built equipment required for my work.
388,"Manuela: Hello, Professor. Dropping by so soon? Are you ill? This is the infirmary, you know. If you're ever wounded or sick, do feel free to drop by. Or if you would like a nice cup of tea. Would you? Well, some other time."
389,"Manuela: Oh, Professor! Dropping by so soon? I expected we'd take some time. Exchange a few smiles as we passed in the hall, flirt a bit, you know... Well, you're here now, and I do like a man who knows what he wants. Lock the door. Huh. That welcome didn't faze you at all, did it? What's the matter? Don't you like me? Or...are you just so innocent you don't understand me?"
390,"Cyril: I'm real busy, so could you please move along now? Thanks. OK now, what else did Lady Rhea need doing today?"
391,"Tomas:  Welcome to the library. Here you may find literature from the far reaches of Fódlan.  I am Tomas, the librarian. If you have need of me, do not hesitate to ask. I have worked here for...hm. I have lost track of the decades, it seems."
392,Rhea: How are you enjoying your time at the academy thus far? I hope you have found our halls brimming with the vitality of well-intentioned souls.
393,"Seteth: Hm. I suppose it is time for you to take charge of one of our three houses of students. I must note that I am personally against entrusting someone as lacking in trackable history as yourself with such a task, but it is as the archbishop desires."
394,"Manuela: The Black Eagles, the Blue Lions, and the Golden Deer… All so different. I hope you’ve made it a point to get to know each of them."
395,"Hanneman: Since you are new here, we have decided to allow you first pick. Manuela and I will take charge of the remaining two houses."
396,"Byleth: (Which house will I choose...)
If the Black Eagles are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?
If the Blue Lions are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?
If the Golden Deer are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?"
397,"If the Black Eagles are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?"
398,"Rhea: So, you have chosen the Black Eagles, led by Edelgard, correct?"
399,"If the Blue Lions are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?"
400,"Rhea: So, you have chosen the Blue Lions, led by Dimitri, correct?"
401,"If the Golden Deer are chosen:
Rhea: So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?"
402,"Rhea: So, you have chosen the Golden Deer, led by Claude, correct?"
403,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes.
Choice 2: No."
404,Choice 1: Yes.
405,Choice 2: No.
406,"Rhea: Are you having trouble deciding? Please, open your heart to the will of the goddess and choose carefully."
407,"Rhea: Your heart has made its choice, then. All I ask is that you guide these open minds with virtue, care, and sincerity."
408,Seteth: They are all promising youths who bear the weight of Fódlan’s future upon their shoulders. I hope you appreciate what an honor it is to lead them.
409,Flayn: Brother? Oh! I am so sincerely sorry! I did not mean to interrupt.
410,"Seteth: I am in the middle of something, Flayn. Is it urgent?"
411,"Flayn: No, no, it’s nothing. More importantly... Who is this?"
412,Seteth: This is our newest professor at the academy.
413,"Flayn: Oh my! A new addition to the Officers Academy! I am so very pleased to meet you, Professor. I am Seteth’s little sister, Flayn. I am so happy to make your acquaintance."
414,"Seteth: Let us focus on the topic at hand. There is something you should be aware of. In a few days’ time, there will be a mock battle between the three houses, intended to gauge the current progress of the students. We will be using this battle as an opportunity to ascertain your own abilities as well. Please do not disappoint the archbishop. That is all."
415,Caspar: Wait. So our new professor is...you?! I didn't see that one coming.
416,"Dorothea: Easy, Caspar. Aren't you being a bit rude?"
417,"Linhardt: You know it's a waste of time to expect politeness from him. (To Byleth) It will be a pleasure learning from you, Professor. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to take a nap. (Linhardt leaves)"
418,"Bernadetta: Ah! Don't look at me like that! Oh, and...please don't talk to me too much either."
419,Dorothea: (sighs) I'm sorry for the chaos you've walked into...
420,"Ferdinand: I hear we are rather close in age, Professor. I hope you do not mind if we treat you like one of us. In our class, we try to treat each other as equals, despite any differences in age or status. Personally, I would love to include you in that inner circle."
421,Byleth: I don't mind at all.
422,"Petra: You have a gut, Professor. I will take great joy from your teachings."
423,"Dorothea: Petra, I believe you mean to say that our professor has guts. That's a bit different from having a gut. You can't go around saying someone so slim and attractive has a gut!"
424,Petra: Oh! Please take my apologies. I have not yet mastered this language.
425,"Edelgard: Professor, I want you to know that it's perfectly acceptable for you to treat me as you do the others. I may be the Imperial Princess, but here at the academy, I'm just another student. That said, know that I have high expectations of you. And high hopes. But I'm certain you can lead the Black Eagle House to greatness."
426,"Caspar: Sure, sure. Now, let's break the ice with a training session! I want to see our new teacher in action."
427,Petra: Why will the ice be broken? Is this a custom I have missed in my studies?
428,"Caspar: Not real ice, just the ice of...um--- Well, it just means let's get to know each other."
429,Bernadetta: I don't wanna train! Let's stay in the classroom and...learn from a book.
430,"Dorothea: Let's all calm down and have a nice cup of tea, how about? Doesn't that sound lovely, Professor?"
431,"Linhardt: (snores offscreen, displayed as ""Zzz..."")"
432,"Ferdinand: I know we all agreed to treat each other as equals, but there is a limit to what I can tolerate. The esteemed Black Eagle House requires order."
433,Hubert: (chuckles) Looks like your first job will be to quiet down this racket. I don't envy you.
434,"Edelgard: Ugh, they're not normally this...rowdy. I do hope you can manage, Professor."
435,"Annette: Wait, does this mean our new professor is-- No! I really can't believe it! But I was speaking to you so casually, as though we were companions! Oh, I am so sorry, Professor; you just look the same age as the rest of us, and-- Oh, and I’m sorry I just said that too! I really must watch my tongue…"
436,Byleth: I don't mind if you treat me as a friend.
437,"Annette: You say that, but...I just don't know about all of this."
438,"Dimitri: I'll admit, it doesn't sit well with me either. After all, we wish to show you due respect."
439,"Sylvain: Sure, but if the professor says it OK, shouldn’t that be enough? That is, if Your Highness can consent to such a thing. After all, we’re already speaking this way to our future king, so we may as well relax our speech with our professor too, right?"
440,"Dimitri: Well, we’re not in the Kingdom, so it only goes to follow that we should all speak companionably. (sighs) I concede. If the professor says it’s fine, we ought to accept that kindness gratefully."
441,"Ingrid: As for me, I'm not sure I can manage."
442,"Mercedes: You don’t have to force yourself if it’s too difficult. You’re fine with that too, right, Professor?"
443,"(if Byleth is female)
Sylvain: Such benevolence is a sight to behold! I don't suppose you would care to join me for tea? We could discuss education...and marriage.
Felix: Control yourself, Sylvain. I have more important matters to discuss with our new professor."
444,Sylvain: Such benevolence is a sight to behold! I don't suppose you would care to join me for tea? We could discuss education...and marriage.
445,"Felix: Control yourself, Sylvain. I have more important matters to discuss with our new professor."
446,"Felix: Having heard of your skills, I'm eager to meet you in battle. Come to the training ground later. There, you will show me what you’re capable of."
447,"Dimitri: You aren't wasting any time, are you, Felix? As it were, count me in for any such battle."
448,Felix: Hmph.
449,"Ashe: Pardon me, but I would also love to observe you in battle, for future reference. If that’s OK with you."
450,"Dimitri: Ashe, I don’t have you speak of merely watching. You should join us as well."
451,"Mercedes: (giggles) If you get injured, simply say the word, and I’ll patch you up straight away!"
452,"Dedue: Your Highness, do take care not to go overboard."
453,"Dimitri: You worry too much, Dedue. I'll be fine, I promise."
454,"Sylvain: My companions, is there not something inherently wrong with crossing blades, as a way to bond with each other?"
455,"Ingrid: Huh, I never thought of it that way. Well, if that’s how you feel, I suppose you’ll just stay behind while the rest of us are at the training ground?"
456,"Sylvain: Ingrid, my dearest friend! You really are too hard on me."
457,"Dimitri: Well then, Professor, what do you think? As you can see, the Blue Lion House is a lively bunch, but you’ll fine none who work harder. I’m certain we’ll cause our fair share of trouble, but I’m very much looking forward to the year ahead."
458,"Hilda: Wait, what?! Are you really our new homeroom professor?"
459,"Ignatz: Is that true? You aren't quite what I pictured. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded."
460,Hilda: I was sure you'd be roped into joining the knights!
461,"Claude: Don't tell me, you chose this class just to get to know me better, right? I'm flattered, really. (chuckles) Whoops. Now that you're our professor, maybe I should choose my words more carefully."
462,Byleth: I don't mind.
463,"Claude: Oh? Well, then. Since we're pretty close in age and all, I suppose formalities aren't all that necessary."
464,"Lorenz: One must truly marvel at the exceptionality of this appointment. Becoming a teacher to students almost the same age as yourself. How...unusual. I've heard you are a skilled mercenary, but I cannot shake my discomfort at your new position."
465,Raphael: Are you really as strong as they say? Let's see your biceps! I bet I've packed on more muscle than you!
466,"Ignatz: I doubt that. Apparently our new professor was personally recommended by Alois, one of the knights."
467,"Claude: As far as skill goes, I saw it with my own eyes. What's more, Teach here is the child of the most renowned former captain of the Knights of Seiros."
468,Leonie: I heard. There's no way a child of the captain isn't worthy. It's simply not possible.
469,"Lysithea: ""The Captain""? Who are you talking about?"
470,"Leonie: Captain Jeralt, of course, the most notable captain of the Knights of Seiros and a peerless mercenary."
471,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He's not that well known...
Choice 2: You're exaggerating a bit."
472,Choice 1: He's not that well known...
473,Choice 2: You're exaggerating a bit.
474,Leonie: Hmph! It doesn't matter what you think of him. Captain Jeralt deserves nothing but respect.
475,"Lysithea: Hm. Well, after working as a mercenary alongside a father figure such as he, I have high hopes for our professor."
476,"Hilda: Just because someone is special... doesn't mean their children are special too, Lysithea. Assuming that a child is going to be exceptional just because of their lineage is a bad idea. (To Marianne) Don't you agree, Marianne?"
477,"Marianne: Huh? Oh, um, yes, I suppose so."
478,"Leonie: Well, we can find out for ourselves in battle. I can't wait to see what tactics you've learned from the captain."
479,Raphael: A battle? Shouldn't we have a welcome party or something first? I'll get the meat.
480,Lorenz: How savage. I propose a nice conversation over tea instead. I am more than willing to procure some high-quality leaves.
481,"Raphael: Tea? You can't get to know someone over tea. If there's no meat involved, it's not a party."
482,Lorenz: Your common sensibilities are grating to my noble ears. Please quiet yourself.
483,"Claude: Sorry for the bickering, Teach. As you can see, the Golden Deer is a rowdy bunch. We're not especially unified. You'll find nobles and commoners alike here-- those who are dedicated to their studies alongside slackers. But hey, that just makes your life more exciting, right? I really hope you're looking forward to the year ahead as much as I am."
484,"Hanneman: Say, while you're here...I'd like to use this device I designed to determine whether the power of a Crest resides within you. Won't hurt a bit. Promise. You don’t know about Crests? Well, allow me to tell you everything–absolutely everything–about them. Is your calendar clear? This will take a while. Crests are a fascinating topic, but before one can dive deeply into said topic, one must first understand what Crests are. They are power incarnate. They are said to have been bestowed upon humans by the goddess countless ages ago. They exist within the flesh, and are passed down through bloodlines. Those who carry crests may excel at magic, display exceptional strength, or any number of boons. Each Crest has its own power, the nature of which is beyond mortal understanding. For now."
485,Byleth: And you believe I have a Crest?
486,"Hanneman: I suspect as much, yes. But we won’t know for sure unless I look into the matter. As I said, Crests are passed down through the blood. However, just because someone carries a Crest does not necessarily mean their descendants will inherit it as well. Only a scarce few descendants of a Crest’s bloodline end up inheriting that Crest’s power. Perhaps one of your ancestors bore a Crest, and you just happened to inherit it. That is how a Crest usually presents itself, after all."
487,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do what you can to find out. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away.
Choice 2: There's no need to look into it.
Hanneman: I most strongly disagree! There absolutely is a need. My Crest research is of critical importance to the church, I'll have you know. Since you are now a professor here, I must insist that you aid in my research. Of course...there are those who lack the foresight to aid in my endeavors, such as that stubborn Seteth. But such individuals are the rare exception."
488,"Choice 1: Do what you can to find out. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away."
489,"Hanneman: Yes, of course. I'll get to the bottom of it straight away."
490,"Choice 2: There's no need to look into it.

But such individuals are the rare exception."
492,"Hanneman: Now then, please go ahead and hold out your arm over this device here."
493,"Hanneman: What is this?! A pattern I’ve never seen before…Is it possible an as-yet undiscovered Crest has been detected? To think there are still Crests out there that even I am unaware of! How thrilling! Ahem… Pardon my unrestrained jubilation. I have much to consider. You may leave now. I have more research to do in regard to this Crest. Yes, so very much more research. But for now, your work here is done. (Hanneman turns away) Hmm… What could this line here be indicating? Perhaps it represents a lack of symmetry… or perhaps… What in the world? Oh, I see… It may be connected to that, but to a greater degree than usual…"
494,Byleth: ...
495,"Rhea: With each moon, professors of the Officers Academy receive a schedule for the month ahead. It notes the days on which events and missions will take place that month. Pay careful attention to your schedule so that you may thoughtfully plan what you intend to do each month, and when."
496,"Byleth: (So, this is my room... I thought I heard a girl's voice...but I must have been imagining things.)"
497,"Edelgard: Some believe the dignity of the Empire rests on the results of the mock battle. That's an overstatement, of course. Still, we must do our best to prevail. You should take the time to learn each student's abilities. Perhaps some extra lessons and training sessions are in order? You look as if you have no idea what's going on here. I know my way around, so I'm happy to help you find your footing.
(Facilities) The monastery has some exceptional facilities that everyone who lives at the Officers Academy is welcome to make use of. For example, you can enjoy a meal with your students at the dining hall or take part in some one-on-one sparring at the training grounds.

(Activity Points) You should take your time when speaking with everyone, but when it comes to using the facilities... Well, you need to be more careful with that. If you use them without planning ahead, your free time will be gone before you know it.

502,Edelgard: I trust you're eager to face the Black Eagles in battle. Enjoy the thrill of anticipation while it lasts. Soon you'll wish you had chosen to lead our house instead.
503,"Dimitri: I hear there will be a mock battle soon. We must not neglect our training. I trust that you will carefully study the strengths and weaknesses of each of your students, that you may provide effective guidance. Regardless of the results, this battle will be a great learning experience. Even so... What is the point of competition if the aim isn't to win? As this is your first time at the monastery, please allow me to show you the ropes.
(Facilities) Both students and teachers of the Officers Academy are free to use the facilities within the monastery. For example, you can dine with others at the dining hall or partake in one-on-one combat in the training grounds. I encourage you to wander around the monastery and lend an ear to the people living here.
(Bulletin Boards and Quests) There are bulletin boards in various places around the monastery. Have you seen them, Professor? There you can find requests from various sources, as well as information about the market. If you fulfill these requests, you should eventually be able to use even more of the facilities here. The bulletin board gets updated frequently. You would do well to check it once a month.
(Activity Points) This probably goes without saying, but no matter which facility you use, it will take up a considerable amount of your time. It's helpful to plan out activities in advance so that you don't mistakenly squander your time here.

509,"Claude: Did you hear the news, Teach? Looks like we're gonna have a good ol' mock battle between the houses! The Golden Deer House isn't exactly what you'd call an elite group just yet, so you may want to whip everyone into shape with some extra training. After all, competition is only fun if you win. To that end, I'd better prepare as well. You know, I was researching what it's like to live here long before I even enrolled. Want me to fill you in, Teach?

515,"Hubert: Dimitri and Claude are the leaders of the other two houses. Do not underestimate them. When we take the field, it would be best not to engage the both of them at once."
516,"Hubert: If you continue to insist on distracting me, I will have no choice but to get rid of you. Joking, of course. (laughs)"

After that teacher ran away during our outdoor training, I figured Jeritza was a natural replacement. I was surprised when you were suddenly appointed professor instead. I don't think I could hold my own against Jeritza in battle. I could probably take you though."

533,"Dorothea: Hi, Professor. How're you doing? If you're not busy, would you like to join me on a little trip into town? If I'm cooped up in this dusty old monastery for too long, it drives me absolutely crazy."
534,"Dorothea: Yes, it's true that I'm the only commoner in the Black Eagle House. I knew that before the first day of class. Those people are simply exhausting."
535,"Petra: Professor. I hope you know I am having great abilities for reading and writing. With sadness, I still have struggles with speaking. If my ways of speak...of speech are causing a burden, I hope you will have forgiveness."

553,"Sylvain: Hey, Professor. If you've got spare time, want to join me for a trip into town? There's an inn that serves the most amazing food. It's one of my favorite places to eat. You simply must come try it with me."
554,"Sylvain: Well, there's Dorothea, Hilda, and Mercedes. Lady Rhea's quite the beauty too. And I must admit, I've even checked out Professor Manuela once or twice. You know, Professor, I think I'm going to like it at the Officer's Academy. There are beautiful girls as far as the eye can see..."
555,"Mercedes: Before I came to the Officers Academy, I attended a school of magic in the Kingdom capital. That's where I met Annie! That's what I call Annette. Oh, I guess Lorenz was at the school of magic too? But Annie was always just so nice to me, even though I was older. She's my best friend in the world."
556,"Annette: Hello, Professor! Uh, I have a teeny tiny question for you, if that's all right... You haven't seen a man with hair the same color as mine, a scowling face, and a generally gloomy demeanour...have you?"

562,"Ingrid: The Blue Lion House derived its names from the honorary title of the first king of Faerghus. Loog, the King of Lions, wore brilliantly blue garments. His chivalric exploits are recorded in multiple legends. The library holds various historical accounts regarding him and the Blue Lions. If you find time, you should read them. They're filled with insights."
563,"Lorenz: Our house is that of the Golden Deer. Do you know the significance of that name, Professor? Golden Deer are sacred creatures said to have protected Leicester since time immemorial. All three of the houses have a meaning behind their name. You should feel free to ask around, if that sort of knowledge interests you."
564,Raphael: Ugh. I really need to eat. I can't hold out until the next meal! Why can't the dining hall stay open all the time? I need to keep eating if I want to get stronger!

578,"Seteth: These are the students' quarters. To better help you supervise them, you also have a room here. Your room is here at the end. Commoner students also reside on the first floor, while the second is primarily for students of noble birth. As a rule, we try to avoid discrimination based on social status here. But the nobility can be quite insistent when it comes to matters of propriety. Speaking of, it would be best for you to avoid improper conduct. I expect you to set a good example for the students."

Oh, right, it was because I just overheard Tomas remarking on the subject. The leader of a legendary group of knights, returned. People are bound to be talking about the ol' captain!"
587,"Jeritza: I care nothing of friendship. If you have no business here, leave."
588,"Jeralt: The church has changed a lot since my time. Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Jeritza, and many of the knights... None of them were around 20 years ago. Have you met Leonie yet?

My research is proceeding slower than I would like. Your Crest is something of a challenge. Frustrating. Yet, also, quite intriguing. I was wondering if I might get a sample of your flesh. A couple square inches would do. No? Perhaps some blood? A couple of drops on the device are all I need."

605,"Student: I'm not too keen on the professor of my class. I really hoped to focus more on strategy. Hmm, maybe I should talk to my professor about transferring to a different class."
606,"Monk: There are two types of Crests. Major Crests manifest their power most effectively, while Minor Crests are slightly weaker. It is said that the closer a person's blood relation is to various saints and Heroes, the higher their chance of bearing a major Crest. Of course, there are also examples of Major Crests manifesting in children whose parents bear no Crest whatsoever. The exact nature of how and why Crests are inherited is still a mystery."
607,"Priest: I hear a member of House Hresvelg, the ruling family of the Empire, has entered the Officers Academy for the first time in ages. It is said that the Adrestian Empire's very founding was aided by none other than Saint Seiros. That is why the Crest of Seiros is on the Imperial flag. In recent years, a rift has developed between the Empire and the church... Let us hope that this will be a good opportunity for both parties to reforge their close relationship of years past."
608,"Knight of Seiros: As part of our commitment to the goddess, the knights undertake various missions across all of Fódlan. Assisting with the education of young nobles is also a part of our sacred duty."
609,"Knight of Seiros: The Imperial princess, the crown prince, and the heir to the Alliance's leading house... This is one exceptional year, that's for sure. If you're a teacher here, you'd better watch your step. If anything were to happen to those kids... Well, suffice to say that it could harm the reputation of the Church of Seiros, which we've spent almost a millennium establishing."
610,"Monk: Tomas has served as the monastery's librarian for decades. Actually, he was away from Garreg Mach for a spell, but he returned to his post last year. There is no one as familiar with the monastery archives as he is."

612,"Dedue: You have my gratitude. The greenhouse is an invaluable resource. If we cultivate more plants, I'm sure we'll be able to cook a larger variety of meals."
613,"Sylvain: If I have to eat in that filthy dining hall, I prefer to invite a cute girl to dine with me. Beforehand, I'll find out her favorite foods so I can order them. She's happy, I'm happy. I haven't missed a move! Pretty great, huh?"
614,"Sylvain: Heh, so you're getting right to it! I'm impressed to find someone who's more proactive than I am. Nice going, Professor. All right, then. Next time will be my turn! (quest completed)"
615,"Flayn: There is a ceremony related to Saint Cethleann that requires rare fish. Would you mind helping me obtain some, Professor? You can fish by speaking with the fishkeeper at the fishing pond."
616,"Flayn: (Quest completed) How wonderful! I am certain Saint Cethleann would be most satisfied by this fish. If you ever wish to fish again, simply let the manager of the fishing pond know."

624,"Edelgard: Simply tell me your weaknesses, and you're welcome to stay. But is there enough time to cover them all?"
625,"Claude: Ah, so you can't win unless you know my weakness? Poor princess. You really should believe in yourself more."
626,"Edelgard: I spare no effort when pursuing victory. As a master of schemes, I should think you would understand."

636,"Manuela: Aw, how precious. Looks like you and the students have become fast friends."
637,"Hanneman: While I am pleased that you are taking the initiative to acquaint yourself with the students, I'm afraid it's about time for the faculty strategy meeting."
638,"Claude: Ah, how time flies! In that case, I'll see you later."
639,"Dimitri: Edelgard, Professor, be careful out there."
640,"Dimitri: Ah, it's finally time for the mock battle. I'm eager to put my skills to use. And you, Professor?"
641,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm looking forward to it. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Excellent. I have high expectations for your command. That said, I've no doubt it will take everything we've got to pull a victory.
Choice 2: I hope we can win.
Dimitri: I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you command use as you did back in the village, I have no doubt we'll be fine."

646,"Dimitri: Our opponents are mighty, that much is certain, but I'm positive we can win."
647,"Claude: Hey there! Did we miss our invite to this strategy meeting? Oh, no worries–we'll just join in now."
648,"Dimitri: Nice try, Claude, but I do not intent to let slip our strategies. Especially when we are up against such strong opponents as you two."
649,"Claude: Well now! Kind words from his kingliness. If that's the case, we'd better come up with some clever schemes so as not to disappoint. Right, Princess?"
650,"Edelgard: Right. No matter the tactics you devise, we will destroy you. The best you can hope for is to learn a thing or two."
651,"Dimitri: Haha, there's nothing wrong with a friendly rivalry, but let's not get carried away. A rash attitude could be your undoing, after all."
652,Edelgard: Hmm... Perhaps your time would be better spent preparing instead of worrying about the competition's mindset.
653,"Claude: Hey, now! If you two are getting this fired up before the battle even starts...it'll make it that much easier for my class to sweep up a win. So please, carry on."
654,"Dimitri: A good point, Claude. I apologize–that wasn't my intention. At any rate, let's vow to make this a productive battle, shall we?"
655,"Byleth:

663,Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.
664,"Claude: Time for a mock battle, eh? Hmm, how should we go about this... Well, you'll be our commander, that much is for sure. Just don't screw it up and everything'll be great. Got it, Teach?
Choice 1: I'm not concerned.
Choice 2: Leave it to me."
665,Choice 1: I'm not concerned.
666,Choice 2: Leave it to me.
667,"Claude: Right. I'll do whatever I can to help too. I mean, I'm kind of obligated to. For example! If I add a little something to their food to upset their stomachs..."
668,Byleth: Don't even think about it.
669,"Claude: Yeah, yeah, wink, wink. I read you. You can't officially condone that sort of thing, right? But say, hypothetically speaking, students from the other houses started racing to the infirmary... As far as anyone knows, it could just be a harmless little stomach bug making the rounds."
670,"Edelgard: Well, well. What a fascinating conversation you two are having. May we join?"
671,"Dimitri: Claude, I can't believe you would stoop to such crooked schemes to gain the advantage. Have you no honor?"
672,"Claude: If that was really my scheme, I wouldn't be talking about it out in the open. I'm afraid you'll have to wait until our battle to see what's really in store."
673,Edelgard: It's irrelevant anyhow. Whatever you have planned won't save you from a crushing defeat.
674,"Dimitri: She has a point. Still, I'm rather eager to see what sort of scheme that mind of yours conjures up."
675,"Claude: You heard 'em, Teach. We can't let these fine folks down."
676,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It will be a fair fight.
Claude: Heh, of course. A fair fight, as all fights are. Good one, Teach. Play innocent now so they won't see it coming.

Claude: Are you serious, Teach? Well, if a crooked scheme is really what you're after, I've got more than a few of those up my sleeve."

683,"Dimitri: I'm sorry, Professors. It's about time I returned to my training anyhow. Claude, Edelgard, until we meet again on the battlefield, farewell."
684,Edelgard: I look forward to assessing your abilities. I hope you don't disappoint.

690,Edelgard: The mock battle is finally here. Will you lead us to victory?
691,"Jeralt: I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win."
692,"Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition."
693,Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
694,"Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt..."
695,"Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way."
696,"Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!"
697,"Dimitri: Once you've finished preparing, make your move. Dedue, Mercedes. Keep our enemy occupied until then."
698,Dedue: I'm on it.
699,Mercedes: Oh my! We'll try our best!
700,"Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!"
701,"Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!"
702,"Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour."
703,"Claude: Welp, we're surrounded. All we can do is fight back with all our might!"
704,"Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence."
705,Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!
706,"Dimitri: Beautiful work, Professor. But the true challenge starts now!"
707,"Dimitri: You're a tough opponent, but I refuse to yield. Do not fool yourself into believing I will hold back!"
708,Edelgard: Dimitri... It's time! We can finally settle the question of who's stronger.
709,"Dimitri: Very well. I accept your challenge. With you as my opponent, I won't hold anything back."
710,Edelgard: I would expect no less!
711,"Claude: Coming up with brilliant schemes, I can handle. No problem. But I'm not much for fighting. Go easy on me!"
712,Byleth: ...
713,"Claude: You know that was a joke, right? Jeez, not so much as a smile..."
714,"Claude: Look at that, a real life princess! I'll have to be careful not to scar that little face of yours."
715,"Edelgard: Careful, Claude. I'll win no matter what, but you're only making things harder for yourself."
716,"Claude: Losing hasn't even crossed your mind, has it? Ooh, this'll be a bit of a shock, then."
717,"Edelgard: To shock was your intention to begin with, was it not?"
718,Lorenz: I've lost?! Oh! Unthinkable!
719,Ignatz: I've lost. The new professor is quite a commander.
720,Hilda: Ouch! Was that really necessary?
721,"Claude: Argh, I hate losing! I guess I'll just have to settle for cheering the others on."
722,Claude: I must have let my guard down. I guess that's a loss for the Golden Deer House.
723,"Manuela: Well done. I nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary.
(If still active) Hanneman: So, you've made it past Manuela, eh? I see now I must focus, and then make my move."
724,"(If still active) Hanneman: So, you've made it past Manuela, eh? I see now I must focus, and then make my move."
725,Ashe: Ah–so strong! Have to do better next time...
726,"Dedue: Ngh. Apologies, Your Highness. I can go no further."
727,Mercedes: Oh no... This is as far as I can go...
728,"Dimitri: My training was insufficient... I am so sorry, everyone. The rest is up to you."
729,Dimitri: I suppose that does it for the Blue Lion House...
730,"Hanneman: My goodness. The leadership of someone with actual battle experience is... Well! I was as good as useless.
(If still active) Manuela: Hey! You didn't compliment me like that when my class won last year!"
731,(If still active) Manuela: Hey! You didn't compliment me like that when my class won last year!
732,"Jeralt: All right, that's that! The winner of this mock battle is... The Black Eagle House!"
733,"Edelgard: Even though it was just a mock battle, we defeated both houses masterfully. Take pride in this victory, everyone!"
734,Dimitri: It is about time for the battle to begin. Our victory depends on your leadership. Do not let us down.
735,"Jeralt: I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win."
736,"Lorenz: None of your shallow tactics are required, Claude. Ignatz and I will dismantle the opposition."
737,Ignatz: Me?! But I'm not ready!
738,"Claude: Are you making light of our new professor? If you drop your guard, you're going to get hurt..."
739,"Edelgard: Dorothea, will you head towards the front lines? I wish to draw the enemy towards us."
740,"Dorothea: You got it, Edie. Leave it to me."
741,"Edelgard: Ferdinand. Hubert. If the enemy comes, stop them."
742,"Ferdinand: Leave it to us, although I could do this on my own."
743,"Hubert: Heh. Clearly not, or Her Highness would not ask me to watch your back."
744,"Claude: Well done, Teach! I may have to take this seriously after all!"
745,"Claude: Let's use the forest to set up an ambush. I'm counting on your support, everyone!"

748,"Claude: Are you really gonna fight two houses at once? Heh, an impressive display of confidence."
749,"Edelgard: Victory is in sight, Black Eagles. Do not let up!"
750,"Edelgard: Flawless tactics, Professor. Our only choice in this situation is a head-on attack!"
751,"Claude: Coming up with brilliant schemes, I can handle. No problem. But I'm not much for fighting. Go easy on me!"
752,Byleth: ...
753,"Claude: You know that was a joke, right? Jeez, not so much as a smile..."
754,"Claude: Psst, Your Princliness. You've got a thing for Edelgard, right? Come on, fess up. You'll feel better."
755,"Dimitri: Claude, please. This is no time for idle banter. Your defenses are wide open."
756,"Claude: That didn't get to him, huh? What a shame. I'll find a better way to ruffle him up next time."
757,Edelgard: There can be no victory unless I defeat you. So be it!
758,Edelgard: Dimitri... It's time! We can finally settle the question of who's stronger.
759,"Dimitri: Very well. I accept your challenge. With you as my opponent, I won't hold anything back."

767,(If still active) Manuela: Hey! You didn't compliment me like that when my class won last year!
768,Ferdinand: I am the son of House Aegir! How did I fail? I must need to train harder...
769,Hubert: Hmm. The new professor's rather strong. Suppose I'll have to call it a day.
770,"Dorothea: My, my... The new professor seems very capable."
771,"Edelgard: Forced to retreat... Well, things will only get tougher from here on out."
772,Edelgard: To think that the Black Eagles could lose so readily...
773,"Manuela: Well done. I nearly wound up a patient in my own infirmary.
(If still active) Hanneman: So, you've made it past Manuela, eh? I see now I must focus, and then make my move."
774,"(If still active) Hanneman: So, you've made it past Manuela, eh? I see now I must focus, and then make my move."
775,"Jeralt: All right, that's that! The winner of this mock battle is... The Blue Lion House!"
776,"Dimitri: This victory is the result of everyone's hard work. Thank you, my friends. You did well."
777,"Claude: So this is the stage for the mock battle... The command's all yours, Teach!"
778,"Jeralt: I'm sure you already understand, but the house that defeats the other two is declared the winner. Incidentally, I'll be overseeing this mock battle. So listen well if you want to win."
779,Ferdinand: I will fight on the front lines! I can stop the enemy's advance with grace!
780,Hubert: Do you have Lady Edelgard's permission to--hmph. I suppose I've no choice but to provide cover.
781,Edelgard: Thank you Hubert. We are off to a terrible start.
782,"Dimitri: Ashe, can you move to the front lines? I want to lure the enemy this way."
783,"Ashe: Got it, Your Highness! Leave it to me!"

787,"Edelgard: Hm, you are performing as expected, Professor. We will have to face you with our full might!"
788,"Edelgard: We will use the forest to ambush our enemy. Everyone, I am counting on your support!"
789,"Jeralt: If they're waiting in the forest, we'd do well to take a detour."
790,"Edelgard: It seems we're surrounded... At a time like this, our only option is to cut a path through!"
791,"Edelgard: Are you planning on fighting two houses at once? I will admit, that is favorable for us."
792,Dimitri: This is a good opportunity for us. Let's forge ahead!

819,"Edelgard: Excellent work today, Professor. Though our victory should come as no surprise."
820,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It was a close call.
Edelgard: Was it? I'm not sure I agree with that.
Choice 2: It was easy.
Edelgard: Yes, it was. Further proof that you're well qualified to guide the Black Eagles."
821,"Choice 1: It was a close call.

824,"Edelgard: Yes, it was. Further proof that you're well qualified to guide the Black Eagles."
825,"Petra: That was impressing, Professor! I mean...impressive. We gained a victory because of your great leadership."
826,"Dorothea: We certainly did. We all tried our best, of course, but we couldn't have won without you."
827,Ferdinand: I was curious what it would look like if you did not hold back. And you did not disappoint!
828,Hubert: Hmph. I daresay we owe our victory to Lady Edelgard.
829,"Linhardt: How so? For that battle, she was only a soldier following our professor's command. Sure, she was an incredibly powerful soldier..."
830,"Caspar: Don't worry about it too much, Linhardt. All that matters is that we won!"
831,"Bernadetta: I'm all done with being on the battlefield, OK? I'd rather stay back than pursue victory out there."
832,Edelgard: You are all as ridiculous as always. We only managed to win because we worked together.
833,"Edelgard: Was it something I said? Is it so odd, me talking about togetherness? If so, that perception must change. In fact, I'm canceling the festivities so we can discuss this topic further. I'm kidding, of course. Come on, everyone! We've earned this celebration."
834,Dimitri: Professor! I've been looking for you.
835,Dimitri: I was hoping we could all share a meal together. It could serve as both a victory celebration and a post-battle analysis. What do you think?
836,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A victory celebration?
Dimitri: Of course. After all, we fought hard out there. Such exertion is bound to make anyone hungry for respite, don't you agree?
Choice 2: I'm invited?
Dimitri: Of course. Why wouldn't you be?"
837,"Choice 1: A victory celebration?

841,"Sylvain: Come now, Professor! We can't very well celebrate without the key to our victory present."
842,"Annette: He's right! He really is! We were only able to win because we had your help, Professor!"
843,"Felix: Yes. Compared with that boar who knows nothing save frontal attacks, your tactics were nearly decent."
844,Ingrid: Felix! You really ought to stop picking fights with His Highness.
845,"Dimitri: Don't worry, Ingrid. I encourage all to speak freely. And I must agree that the professor's tactics were truly extraordinary. I have much to learn."
846,"Mercedes: Oh, sure, but today was exhausting, I'm so hungry I can barely stand..."
847,"Ashe: To be honest, so am I. Let's head to the dining hall. Together."
848,"Dimitri: Professor. I'm sorry to intrude, but...you don't look too happy for someone who just won."
849,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're mistaken.
Dimitri: You say that, but your eyes tell a different story.
Choice 2: Is that so...
Dimitri: Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying."
850,"Choice 1: You're mistaken.
Dimitri: You say that, but your eyes tell a different story."
851,"Dimitri: You say that, but your eyes tell a different story."
852,"Choice 2: Is that so...
Dimitri: Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying."
853,"Dimitri: Hm. Well, I understand how difficult it can be to accept joy sometimes. I'm sorry for prying."
854,"Dimitri: I know we only just met, so this may be difficult for you, but... I'd love nothing more than to share our happiness with you. Joy can be so fleeting, after all. We're all in this together...so I hope you will consent. I'm sure the rest of the class feels the very same. Well...come along, Professor. Let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!"
855,"Claude: Great work, Teach! That was a brilliant win.
Choice 1: I'm glad we won.
Claude: I've been anticipating that magic moment when your tactics and my schemes entwined, and you did not disappoint. That composed expression you always sport like a permanent mask is a perfect complement to my ruthless scheme. That's a joke, of course. Mostly.
Choice 2: Everyone did well.
Claude: Huh. Playing ignorant as to the quality of you command and deflecting the praise to your students. You really are a model professor, Teach."

860,"Claude: To be honest, I had a bunch of other schemes planned as well, just in case the situation called for it. But I didn't have to resort to any of them. I suppose our opponents lucked out."
861,"Lorenz: Well met, Professor! The breadth of your skill was on full display today. I must admit that your tactics were masterful. I shudder to think what may have transpired had it been Claude leading us into battle."
862,"Raphael: I noticed that too! We just did what you told us, and we won! I love it!"
863,"Lysithea: As expected from a child of the former captain of the knights. Thank you for today, Professor. I have much to consider."
864,"Hilda: I never doubted that our professor would be amazing! It was way too obvious. Don't you agree, Marianne?"
865,"Marianne: Huh? Me? Oh, um, yes. Of course. Well done, Professor."
866,Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught his child well. It would have been more of a surprise had our professor proved lacking.
867,"Ignatz: Don't you think it's a bit hard to give Jeralt all of the credit, Leonie? In any case, it's clear that we only won because of our new mentor's guidance."
868,"Claude: A mercenary's wisdom and techniques are forged in battle. Those are the sorts of things you can only learn through experience. Right, Teach? But more importantly, it's time to celebration our victory! Teach here has yet to try my well renowned home cooking."
869,"Claude: I really do hope you'll join us. After all, I swiped some finely aged cheese from the dining hall for just this occasion."
870,"Rhea: Your work with the students was remarkable. I can see Jeralt trained you well. I do hope you were able to use the occasion to bond with the students.
Choice 1: I did.
Rhea: I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still.
Choice 2: Not really.
Rhea: Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise."
871,"Choice 1: I did.
Rhea: I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still."
872,Rhea: I am so happy to hear it. Nothing would please me more than if you would use this coming year to grow closer still.

Rhea: Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise."
874,"Rhea: Oh? Well, you have only just met them, so I suppose that should come as no surprise."
875,"Seteth: Of course, the mock battle was mere practice. The real fight is the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, which will take place during the Wyvern Moon. You are expected to properly train your students so as not to humiliate the academy during the long-held tradition that is the coming battle."
876,"Rhea: As for today, I have called you here to tell you of your mission for the month ahead. Your class is to dispose of some bandits causing trouble nearby.
Choice 1: My mission?
Choice 2: Bandits?"
877,Choice 1: My mission?
878,Choice 2: Bandits?
879,"Seteth: Those affiliated with Garreg Mach Monastery have a moral obligation to help those in need, regardless of social standing. Students are no exception. Each month, before the newly birthed moon departs, each house of students must complete their assigned mission. You shall work to complete the task at hand alongside your students and report back to the archbishop before the deadline. Understood? I will soon provide you with the necessary details for your first mission. If I told you now, I expect you would only forget, and I despise repeating myself."
880,Rhea: I can sense something special within your heart... I have high hopes for you.
881,"Sothis: Bandits, they say…"
882,Byleth: ?!
883,"Sothis: Do you recall when we first met? You shall not fall so shamelessly again, correct?"
884,Byleth: ...
885,"Sothis: Have you no words for me? Do not tell me that you are shocked to hear from me! You ought to know that I am always with you now. To hear my voice should not come as a shock.
Choice 1: Right.
Choice 2: I don't understand.
Sothis: Whatever shall I do with you? I am alive within the confines of your heart. I am unknown to all but you. But through your eyes and ears, I see and hear. Just listen to your heart, as you are doing now, and we may speak like this. That is all that I know."
886,Choice 1: Right.
887,"Choice 2: I don't understand.
Sothis: Whatever shall I do with you? I am alive within the confines of your heart. I am unknown to all but you. But through your eyes and ears, I see and hear. Just listen to your heart, as you are doing now, and we may speak like this. That is all that I know."

889,Byleth: ...
890,Kostas: What is this nonsense?! All I was told was to kill as many noble pipsqueaks as possible! No one said anything about the Knights of damned Seiros being on our trail!
891,Flame Emperor: You have proven yourself worthless. Distracted by something so trivial. I had hoped you would achieve your goal despite the setback. But now a child of the Knights’ former captain is in play. How interesting.
892,"Kostas: Hey, this isn't what I agreed to!"
893,Flame Emperor: Hiring a mercenary as a professor. What was that woman thinking?
894,Kostas: Are you listening to me?! How do we finish this?!
895,Flame Emperor: You die.
896,Kostas: Wh– What?
897,Flame Emperor: Underestimating the Knights was an amateur mistake. One you will pay for. The road to eternal torment awaits you all. Now I must locate your replacements...
898,Kostas: Wait! Get back here! Damn you!

966,"Seteth: As you have already been notified, your mission is to subdue some bandits. Our students have been learning about combat through study, but this is a precious opportunity to provide them with practical experience. The knights will support your mission and are prepared to offer their assistance if necessary. In short, this is no mock battle. You must be prepared for anything. You will receive a message from the knights when it is time to depart. Until then, use your time wisely."
967,"Edelgard: The last time we fought bandits, you saved me. Maybe I can return the favor this time."
968,"Byleth:

Choice 2: Don't get careless."
969,Choice 1: Let's do our best.
970,Choice 2: Don't get careless.
971,"Edelgard: The knights are well aware of our enemy's strength. We can count of them to keep the battlefield under control for us. It seems unlikely that we would lose. Still, let's do all we can to prepare."
972,"Dimitri: This will be our first true battle. I'm looking forward to fighting alongside you, Professor."
973,"Byleth:
Choice 1: As am I.
Choice 2: I'm a bit concerned."
974,Choice 1: As am I.
975,Choice 2: I'm a bit concerned.
976,"Dimitri: During the mock battle, your commands were thoughtful and thorough, as was your strategy. With you on our side, I'm confident we will prevail. It seems we have some time to spare before our departure. Let's use this opportunity to prepare as best we can."
977,"Claude: More bandits? Not very original, Teach."
978,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not interested?
Choice 2: You need to focus."
979,Choice 1: Not interested?
980,Choice 2: You need to focus.
981,"Claude: Well, as long as you're with us, at least things won't be boring. In fact... It may take a turn for the interesting. And with that, I take my leave to make my final preparations."
982,Jeralt: You seem well. Are you adjusting to life at the monastery?
983,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think so.
Jeralt: Oh? I didn't expect that answer. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. But I guess I was wrong to worry.
Choice 2: Not quite. (Relationship with Jeralt up)
Jeralt: Well, I didn't expect it would be easy on you. When we were mercenaries, I handled everything. Outside of battle, you didn't have much contact with people, did you? I thought being thrown into a swarm of noble brats to teach would be a bit much for you. It seems I was right to worry."

988,"Jeralt: By the way, I heard about those bandits. Your first assignment is to take them out, right? That's fairly routine for you by now, but don't forget it's the first real taste of battle for those brats. It'll be tougher to sleep at night if you let one of your little pupils die, so stay vigilant and lead them well. I wish I could offer you my support, but Lady Rhea won't allow it. For now, I'll try to figure out what she wants from you. I don't mind you settling into your life here, but don't let your guard down. Ever."
989,Byleth: ... (A girl's voice... What could it mean?)
990,"Edelgard: For some students, this will be their first time stepping onto a real battlefield. It's important that they're mentally prepared. As for me? Ha! Do I look green to you? Is there anything you wish to ask me about, regarding spending your time at the monastery or battles?
(Faculty Training) Edelgard: Just as students have much to learn from other students, professors can also share their knowledge with each other. You should consider seeking instruction from Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela. I think you'll find their insight quite interesting.
(Recruiting) Edelgard: Which house a student is assigned to depends on where they're from. That said, each professor has their own area of expertise. So if a student is adamant about it, it is possible to switch someone from one house to another. Pending your approval, of course. If you become closer with the students by partaking in the various activities around the monastery, you'll be able to talk to them about such things."

993,Edelgard: You're quite powerful to have beaten us in the mock battle. Such a shame you aren't leading our class...
994,"Dimitri: We have only just arrived at the academy, and we're already being sent out to take care of bandits. It is a noble mission, but one that will likely require battle. In practice, there is little difference between a battle and a war. Even with the support of the Knights of Seiros, we must still brace ourselves for the challenge. Do you have any other questions about life at the monastery or about battle?
(Faculty Training) Dimitri: Just as students receive guidance from professors, professors may also guide each other. If you're interested, you should seek out Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.
(Recruiting) Dimitri: A student's house is determined by their place of origin, but naturally, each individual has their own aptitudes and interests. That said, if a student so desires and their current professor consents, they may transfer from one house to another. If you get to know the students better through the activities at the monastery, they may approach you about this."

997,"Dimitri: Your performance in the mock battle was exceptional, Professor. You have inspired me to follow your example and study even more diligently. Perhaps we could train together sometime. I would love to test myself against your sword skills again."
998,"Claude: Those bandits really didn't think things through, did they? They had to have known the knights would be after them the moment they entered the monastery's turf. Fine by me, though. I'm raring for some real combat experience. Any chance to grow is a good thing. Is there anything else you want to ask me, Teach? About living at the monastery or combat, anything like that?
(Faculty Training) Claude: Students aren't the only ones who have something to learn from their professors. Professors can also learn from each other. If you want to, you should try trading knowledge with Professor Hanneman or Professor Manuela.
(Recruiting) Claude: The house a student belongs to is determined by where they're from, but it is possible for someone to switch to a different one. Of course, that's only if the student very strongly wants to make the change and their professor is on board with it. If you do a lot of different activities around the monastery, you'll get closer to students and they may ask you about it."

1001,"Claude: I hear you've been tasked with hunting down bandits, right? Meanwhile, my class is stuck with a downright peaceful mission. Sounds like you'll be fighting alongside the knights too. Don't let the monastery down, Teach."
1002,"Hubert: I fully accept the necessity of real battle from time to time, but it is still a surprise to be tasked with punishing bandits without warning. It is a rather different sort of mission. It makes me wonder what the archbishop is planning..."
1003,Hubert: I've heard your class is hunting thieves. That mission is very different from the one we were given.
1004,"Ferdinand: Do you know of the Aegir family? We have long held the position of prime minister in the Empire. The Empire's power lies with six noble families, my family foremost among them. The full explanation may be time-consuming. I can give you a moment to get ready, if you would like to take notes."
1005,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm not taking notes.
Choice 2: I'm ready."
1006,Choice 1: I'm not taking notes.
1007,Choice 2: I'm ready.
1008,"Ferdiand: All right. I will list the six great noble families. There's Caspar's father, Count Bergliez, the Minister of Military Affairs. Then there's Linhardt's father, Count Hevring, the Minister of Domestic Affairs. Beradetta's father, Count Varley, is the Minister of Religious Affairs. Hubert's father, Marquis Vestra, is the Minister of the Imperial Household. Finally we have Duke Gerth, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and my own father, Duke Aegir, the Prime Minister. One day, I will take his place as the prime minister of the Empire. I am more talented than anyone in my class — even Edelgard. I will lead the Empire to a bright, enlightened future."

1012,Ferdinand: There is nothing I cannot achieve.
1013,"Linhardt: Swimming through a sea of countless books, tracking down that single sought-after volume... It's absolute bliss. How do the poor fools who spend their days sharpening swords and polishing armor find any joy in life?"
1014,"Caspar: Hey there, Professor! You here to check in on my training? Oh, that reminds me. I found this small cloth. It's kinda weird. Not really sure what it is, but it works great for wiping up sweat!"
1015,Byleth: ...
1016,Bernadetta: Wh-what is it? I'm not doing anything!
1017,"Byleth:

Dorothea: Eh? Um... OK...

1034,"Petra: Brigid has much more warmth than Fódlan. Even spring here has coolness! And you, Professor? Which do you find is worst? Too hot or too cold weather?"
1035,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The cold. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: I have agreeance! In Brigid, I am able to be wearing much lighter clothes.
Choice 2: The heat.

1040,"Dedue: It is better if you do not approach me. If you spend too much time around a man of Duscur, there will be rumors."
1041,"Felix: For years, the boar prince and I were inseparable. I know him better than almost anyone else. So let me give you some advice. Beneath all that princely polish, he's an animal, nothing more. He's strong and skilled, sure. But don't place your trust in him as a human being. Take care he doesn't chew you up and spit you out."
1042,"Ashe: It's thanks to my adoptive father, Lonato, that a commoner like me is here at the academy. He is the very model of chivalry. Someday I'm going to be just like him."
1043,"Sylvain: Professor, you're the one taking out the bandits? Heh, that's one way to start your career at the academy. I didn't realize they'd order us to risk our lives here. Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?"
1044,"Sylvain: Our first assignment is to take out some bandits? Did anyone tell Lady Rhea that people's lives are at stake? I lost my own brother to bandits... ...Is something someone has said at some point, I'm sure. OK. Not my finest attempt at humor."
1045,"Mercedes: The cathedral is nice and quiet. It's so relaxing... Oh, Professor. Did you come to pray to the goddess?"

1057,"Ingrid: Felix, Sylvain and I have known each other since we were children. His Highness, as well. Though I should warn you that both Felix and Sylvain are a bit...challenging at times. The moment I take my eyes off them, they're off causing all kinds of trouble. It's always been that way."
1058,"Ingrid: Now that you're all the way over here, Professor, care to join me in some training? After training, I love tending to the horses or burying myself in a good pile of books. Ahh, there's truly nothing better!"
1059,"Lorenz: It is the duty of every Fódlan noble to demonstrate piety toward Seiros. Have you also come to offer your prayers to the goddess, Professor?"
1060,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sure.
Lorenz: You don't sound terribly sure. Perhaps you are not of noble birth? After all, devotion is not as essential for a commoner.
Choice 2: Not exactly. (Relationship with Lorenz up)

1077,"Lysithea: There were way too many vegetables in today's meal. The ratio of vegetables to sweets was completely skewed... Oh! Hi, Professor! Were you just eavesdropping on me? Well...everyone knows a plateful of sweets is far preferred to a plateful of vegetables, regardless of age."
1078,"Marianne: Um, Professor? Our next mission is to go after a group of bandits. I'm...not very confident. I'm afraid I'll just hold everyone else back. I should probably stay behind for this one. Or help plan the attack instead."
1079,"Marianne: Uh. Hello. Um, if you'll excuse me..."
1080,"Hilda: I'm bored! Maybe I should go into town... But that would be such a hassle. Oh! Hi, Professor. I'm rather busy right now, so do make it quick."

1086,"Leonie: Professor! Hey, do you know how old Captain Jeralt is?"
1087,"Jeralt: That's enough, Leonie. If I don't know, how could my child know?"
1088,"Leonie: It's not normal to forget your own age, you know. It's kind of worrisome, actually."
1089,"Jeralt: By the time you're forgetting your own age, you're past the point of caring."
1090,"Leonie: I guess if you put it that way, you've got a point..."

1121,"Manuela: You know, Professor, there are some things I'll just never understand. Like the other night, I went on a date with a dashing, handsome, strong, young knight. Oh, I'm a bit weak just remembering him. Anyway... Do you know what that no-good jerk said when we got back to my room? He said, ""What a mess. I'm afraid to go in there!"" Can you believe it?! You know who cares about keeping everything neat and tidy? Not me, that's who. ""Afraid to go in there."" Some knight he is!"
1122,Tomas: Do you know about the cardinals? They are the ones who run the church. Their identities are a closely guarded secret...

1124,"Anna: Hello there! Are you that new professor everyone's talking about? Name's Anna. I'm a merchant who slings wares all around Fódlan... and beyond! I come in here all the time, so I'm sure our paths will cross more. Hopefully much more!"
1125,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Are you settled in here at the monastery yet? Make sure to have a good look around! There's much to see! Like fish! You do know about the pond behind the dining hall, right? You can fish there! Give it a try!"

1127,"Knight of Seiros: The Knights of Seiros are also known as the shining knights. We are the sword and shield of the divine Seiros. There are many orders of knights in the world, but we are the only one that has the honor of bearing the name Seiros. As a member of the church, you should probably study up on the history of Seiros and the knights."
1128,"Knight of Seiros: I hear the Officers Academy of the monastery was founded about two centuries ago. The eastern region of Fódlan was being invaded by Almyra, and so the archbishop of the time took measures to prevent the border from being taken. In order to ensure Fódlan would be safe from potential threats, she deemed it necessary to raise a generation of excellence. That is how the establishment was founded, though its purpose has changed over the years."
1129,"Monk: Zanado, the Red Canyon, is a place of great significance to the Church of Seiros. Even members of the church are forbidden from entering without permission. To go trampling around in there, causing trouble... Those bandits truly are morally reprehensible."
1130,"Student: Brigid, Almyra, Duscur... Even people from far-off lands gather here at the academy. Word of advice, Professor. There are those who don't think kindly of such people."
1131,"Yuri: Whoever you are, it doesn't matter much to me. But I do advise getting out of here before you get tangled up in trouble. Unless you've been sent here under someone's orders. In which case, I'll happily show you a good time. Heh heh..."

1138,"Yuri: ""Ah, it's you. Bit of a trek, coming all the way down here, huh? I'll be helping you out now, but just so you know, my life is still down here. If you can't find me in the classroom on the surface, you'll likely find me here instead."""

1154,"Constance: Ah. Come to invite me to a lesson or some such, have you? I prefer not to be aboveground during the day when I can help it. Unless there are storm clouds above."

1163,Magic wielder: Such an innocent face you have... This isn't a place for innocent people. Especially not if you're carrying money.
1164,Rogue: Hey. What are you lookin' at? I don't want any trouble. Get lost.
1165,"Jeralt: A real battle this month, huh? I hear even the Knights of Seiros are involved. I never taught you much about tactics, but there's a primer in my room. Give it a read."

1167,"Head Chef: I'm fresh out of recipe ideas. Say... Perhaps you could find some for me. Maybe a student or the library's cookbooks can spark some inspiration. Let me know, will you?"

1171,"Seteth: The Western Church, which rules over the western parts of Fódlan, has lately made some strange troop movements. If you hear anything concerning, be sure to let me know.."
1172,"Seteth: So... the rumors are spreading. Still, it may be ill-advised to move against fellow followers of the faith. Even so, this is good information to have. I thank you."
1173,"Girl: I've been sharing my food with the hungry pups and kitties, but... there are a lot of them! Could you help me out?"
1174,"Girl: Thanks for helping me out! Let's work together to take care of all our little furry friends, OK? Say, do you have a favorite, Professor? It's OK to have one, you know. Even if I love them all..."

1188,"Ingrid: Just as planned. They're in Zanado, the Red Canyon."
1189,Ashe: We certainly can't allow those underhanded thieves to get away. Let's work together and do our best to take them down!
1190,Dedue: It matters not who we're up against. They will not harm His Highness.
1191,"Felix: Hmph. We're just fighting common thieves, right? I don't expect much of a challenge."
1192,Sylvain: Aren't you a spoilsport. I'm actually quite excited myself. Who knows... There may even be some cute lady thieves.
1193,"Annette: Hmm. Well, at any rate, a real battle is a great opportunity for us to see how far we've come."

1206,"Dimitri: They...they died. Both of them. I'm all that remains of them now... Anyhow, I'm sorry to bore you with such things. I'd say it's nearly time for us to depart. Eh, Professor?"
1207,"Claude: Hey, Teach. Glad you could make it. We've been waiting on you."
1208,Lorenz: It seems the knights have our foes cornered. They are in Zanado–the Red Canyon.
1209,Raphael: It's bandit time? That sounds like real knight work. Let's get to it!
1210,Leonie: I'm itching to put my skills to the test as well. We have to win so Captain Jeralt can see how much I've learned!
1211,"Ignatz: I thought Jeralt wasn't coming with us. Either way, I'll give it everything I've got."
1212,"Marianne: Um... Even if I go, it's not like I'd be of any use..."

1225,"Edelgard: So this is the Red Canyon... A ruin of sorts by the look of it. Let's end this quickly. The thieves must have been driven back. Be careful, or the cornered mice might bite us."
1226,Kostas: The knights chased us all the way here?!
1227,"Thief: Chief, let's get out of here! There's no way we can win against them!"
1228,Kostas: Shut your dumb mouth! Where would we go at this point? You can't be a thief if you fear death!
1229,"Edelgard: Professor...I hear there's a back road to the west. Why don't we split up and attack from both the west and the front? If we advance tactfully, we can attack our enemy from both sides. I leave the rest to you. Regardless, we must cross the bridge first."
1230,Edelgard: Regrettable...but there was no other way.
1231,"Hubert: Allow me to clean this up for you, Lady Edelgard."
1232,Ferdinand: These ruffians are no match for a noble like me!
1233,Linhardt: I...I killed them. What have I done? The blood...
1234,"Caspar: Are all real battles this exciting? Come on, let's get on to the next one!"
1235,Bernadetta: I don't care if they're stealing! Can I go home?!
1236,"Dorothea: So, is making us experience a real battle part of the church's teachings?"
1237,"Petra: People and beasts are as one. Calm your heart, and do not be worried about this killing."
1238,"Edelgard: Thank you for leading us, Professor. Though I suppose there was no way we could lose to a familiar foe. In any case, something about this canyon feels...inexplicably strange."
1239,"Dimitri: The Red Canyon... This is the first time I have ever been here. It's like walking through a ruin. Let's get this battle out of the way, Professor. The thieves must have already been driven back."
1240,Kostas: The knights chased us all the way here?!
1241,"Thief: Chief, let's get out of here! There's no way we can win against them!"
1242,Kostas: Shut your dumb mouth! Where would we go at this point? You can't be a thief if you fear death!
1243,"Dimitri: According to our information, there is a back road to the west. Let's split up and approach from the west and the front. If we advance cleverly, we attack from both sides and gain the advantage. I'll leave the rest to you, Professor. But before all else, we'll need to cross the bridge."
1244,"Dimitri: I know they are just thieves, but this never gets easier for me…"
1245,Felix: Finished already? I was hoping for more of a challenge.
1246,Ashe: If I’d hesitated… that would’ve been me.
1247,"Sylvain: I had to do it. Don’t hate me, please."
1248,Ingrid: I can’t relax here. We need to prepare for our next battle!

1252,"Dimitri: We have defeated the thieves. We'll follow the knights' instructions for what to do next. You led us well, Professor."
1253,"Claude: So this is the Red Canyon? Doesn't look red to me... Anyway, let's get things started, Teach. Looks like the thieves have been driven back. That's what we last heard, so no surprise there."
1254,Kostas: The knights chased us all the way here?!
1255,"Thief: Chief, let's get out of here! There's no way we can win against them!"
1256,Kostas: Shut your dumb mouth! Where would we go at this point? You can't be a thief if you fear death!
1257,"Claude: I hear there's a back road to the west. How about we split up and attack from there and from the front? We may be able to corner the enemy by approaching from both sides. In any case, we need to cross the bridge first. I'll leave the details to you, Teach."

1259,Lorenz: It is a noble's duty to guard the welfare of the people. Nothing personal
1260,"Hilda: I was planning to just sit back and watch. But hey, I got one!"
1261,Ignatz: I'm sorry... I didn't have a choice.
1262,Raphael: This is my first real fight. I guess I'm pretty strong!
1263,Lysithea: A precious opportunity to test my own strength. I won't make waste of your deaths.
1264,"Marianne: Please forgive me, Goddess...and save their souls..."
1265,Leonie: This is what I've trained for!
1266,"Claude: Those thieves ran out of luck when they entered this canyon. They never had a chance. Your leadership was amazing, Teach. Let's leave the rest of the work to the knights."
1267,Thief: We stole this treasure! It's all ours! There's not way we're gonna give it up to some knights!
1268,"Kostas: Damn, they're coming from the west too! I can't stand these brats!"
1269,"Kostas: Y-you're... It can't be! The mercenary from before? So what, now you're pals with the knights? I'll kill you and your pesky brats!"
1270,Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
1271,Edelgard: Do you really think being born a commoner gives you the right to kill? Despicable.
1272,Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
1273,"Dimitri: Unfortunately for you, I will not oblige. You will regret all that you have done."
1274,Kostas: Spoiled little noble! Just die like a good little rich kid!
1275,Claude: Being noble has nothing to do with who you are as a person or how hard your life is. Your logic is illogical!
1276,Kostas: Sending these brats instead of the knights means they've underestimated me! Big mistake!
1277,Kostas: I should have never listened to that idiot... What a mistake... (groans)

1305,Sothis: Oh... You think you're standing strong? Of course you are! It was a jest.

1312,"Edelgard: The area was covered in ruins, each more curious than the last. They did not match the architectural style of any era or culture within the Empire. Or across all of Fódlan, for that matter. That can only mean one thing... The valley's civilization must have flourished and fallen in the distant past, long before the Empire was established. Who do you think lived there?"

Choice 2: Actually... (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: It seemed familiar to you? Huh. Can't say the same. Maybe it's a memory from when you were a child. Or from a past life. Anyway, if you can't remember, I guess there isn't really much more to be said."

1340,"Rhea: So, you have safely disposed of those bandits. I pray that their souls find salvation. But why did they target the students to begin with? We must further investigate the true cause of all that took place. Until we know more, I ask that you support the students and relieve them of any unnecessary worry."

1344,"Rhea: Good. I have high expectations for you. By the way, how was your time in Zanado? Legend has it, in ancient times, a goddess alighted upon this world in that very canyon. For a goddess from heavens, Zanado could only have been a temporary haven."

Choice 1: A goddess?
Choice 2: A temporary haven?"

1347,Choice 2: A temporary haven?
1348,"Rhea: Long ago, the divine Seiros received a revelation from the goddess. A gift, to help the lost. The goddess is always watching over Fódlan from her kingdom above. However, in ancient times, the goddess graced this world with her presence and offered salvation to the people here. She is the mother of all life, the arbiter of every soul."

1354,Rhea: As you wish. We shall continue our discussion when next we meet.
1355,"Sothis: A goddess... I have no memory of her. But then... I have no memory at all! Oh, how bothersome! It is as though I know...and yet I don't. Perhaps Zanado was my home back when the goddess walked the land. If so... What does that make me now? A ghost?"
1356,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That must be it.

1361,"Sothis: Of course, we also have the mystery of why I'm here with you. Is it somehow connected? Perhaps some past regret is stopping me from moving on, and now I'm forced to stay with you instead... No, that's not it! I can't believe in such a meaningless existence! I... I... (yawns loudly)"

1433,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who is Lord Lonato?
Choice 2: Why would he do that?"
1434,Choice 1: Who is Lord Lonato?
1435,Choice 2: Why would he do that?
1436,Rhea: Lord Lonato is a minor lord of the Kingdom. He has been showing hostility towards the church for some time now.
1437,"Seteth: A vanguard unit from the Knights of Seiros is already on its way to his stronghold, Castle Gaspard. Lord Lonato's army is nothing compared to the knights. It's quite possible the rebellion has already been suppressed."
1438,"Rhea: Even so, I would like for your class to travel with the knights' rear guard to deal with the aftermath."
1439,"Seteth: War zones are unpredictable. We do not expect you will have cause to battle, but be prepared for the worst."

1442,"Catherine: Nice to meet you. We've heard a lot about you. If you need anything, just ask."
1443,"Rhea: She is one of our bravest knights, and that is no small feat. Only an exceptional few have what it takes to join the Knights of Seiros. This mission should prove useful in demonstrating to the students how foolish it would be to ever turn their blades on the Church..."
1444,"Sothis: You have spent quite some time in here, engaging in such idle chatter. Do you not know that we do not have a moment left to waste?"
1445,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I had forgotten.
Sothis: Forgotten? I don't believe that is the truth. No, it is more likely you were dreaming the whole day away. You must try harder from now on.

1451,"Edelgard: Lord Lonato must know that his efforts are futile...yet he can't help but fight. If I were in that situation, I would do whatever it took to ensure victory. You can count on that."
1452,"Dimitri: Doubtless, there are times when one must take up their blade, even if there's no chance of winning. But this... It's downright senseless. Lord Lonato knows better. If he had enough allies to back his rebellion, it would be a different matter..."

1457,"Dimitri: After Faerghus lost its king, there were many rebellions. It is likely Lord Lonato's provocations are related. How frustrating that I am too young to take the throne. Rendered powerless by age... If the throne is vacant much longer, the Kingdom will fall to ruin!"
1458,"Claude: First that bandit business, and now a noble rebellion? Are we ever gonna do anything but find and subdue people? Well, if we're just going to tie up loose ends, at least it'll be pretty safe. I don't mind stretching my legs for this one. And if Catherine's going, too, there's a good chance we'll get a look at her Relic in action."
1459,"Claude: Hey, Teach. There's some minor noble rebelling in Faerghus, right? He has no chance of winning. I wonder what he hopes to achieve... Huh? Are you going along to help? Sounds like an easy victory, but good luck out there."
1460,Hubert: Something about this situation doesn't feel right. Why would a minor lord raise an army against a foe he cannot possibly hope to defeat?

1481,"Dorothea: Are you going to fight alongside the Knights of Seiros? Hmm... Let me know if you meet anyone I might be interested in, OK?"
1482,Petra: The plants of Fódlan are different ones than in Brigid. And people here are unknowing of the spirits who watch over the earth and bless it. Only the goddess is known. Is that factual?
1483,Petra: This flower is one that is eating insects. Is that factual too? I am wondering who watches over the plants in Fódlan...
1484,"Dedue: His Highness is strong. But on the front lines, anything can happen. Losing him would be devastating for Faerghus. I hope the church understands that."
1485,Dedue: Best be on your guard.
1486,"Felix: Catherine, hm? Her skill is impressive, I'll admit. So is her sword. But I think she's hiding something. Nobody knows anything about her past. You should spar with her. She's strong. Stronger than you are, I'd bet."
1487,"Ashe: Ngh... Please, Professor, there must be some mistake. Lonato would never raise arms against the church. At least, he never said anything to me about it."
1488,"Ashe: What's going to happen to Lonato? If he's killed, I... I don't know how I'll live with that."

Sylvain: Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!"
1491,"Choice 1: I saw him at the training ground. (Relationship with Sylvain up)

Sylvain: Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!"
1494,"Sylvain: Ah, right, it is meal time. Sorry for bothering you, Professor. Thanks!"
1495,Sylvain: Don't you love looking after horses? I do. They repay your absolute love and trust with the same. I wish girls were so easy to deal with...
1496,"Mercedes: I've heard whispers about Lord Lonato. They say he is a very kind and gentle lord. Why would such a kind man suddenly raise an army? Oh, Professor. You were working late last night, weren't you? You shouldn't overdo it. A ghost might rise up from the well to get you if you stay you too late! Or so I'm told."
1497,"Annette: We're going on a mission with the knights, right? I wonder if... Oh... Sorry! It's nothing. I was just wondering if someone I've been searching for might be among them."
1498,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're looking for a knight?
Annette: Yes. Well...maybe? If he's here, he's probably a knight. Though it's also possible he became a monk...
Choice 2: I hope you find whomever you're looking for. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: Thank you. I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!"
1499,"Choice 1: You're looking for a knight?
Annette: Yes. Well...maybe? If he's here, he's probably a knight. Though it's also possible he became a monk..."

Annette: Thank you. I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!"
1502,Annette: Thank you. I'm definitely going to find him one of these days!
1503,"Annette: To be honest, I've felt a bit lost here at the monastery. At a loss for what to do. Thankfully, a sweet young girl reached out and offered help. I believe she's Seteth's little sister."
1504,"Ingrid: Why does His Highness take the side of the people of Duscur? I just don't understand it. Only four years ago, they murdered our king and slaughtered the soldiers and knights who were with him, all of whom were innocent. Even if he can forgive them, I can't–not ever. What they've done is against all codes of honor and ethics."
1505,"Ingrid: We are truly blessed with how fertile the monastery grounds are. Every day, there's something new to harvest!"
1506,"Lorenz: It's a noble's duty to protect the commonfolk, not to endanger them by rallying armies in such a feckless and improper manner. Abuse of that kind is no better than slavery. A proper noble must guard the people from such a fate, wouldn't you say?"
1507,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: Precisely why true nobility is well respected.
Choice 2: We don't know all the details yet.
Lorenz: There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly."
1508,"Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: Precisely why true nobility is well respected."
1509,Lorenz: Precisely why true nobility is well respected.
1510,"Choice 2: We don't know all the details yet.
Lorenz: There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly."
1511,Lorenz: There can be no legitimate cause for a noble to abandon that basic obligation. Let us put an end to this quickly.
1512,"Raphael: Hey, Professor! Do you happen to have any food on you? I'm starving! No matter how much I eat before I train, I'm always so hungry after. My muscles must be going through a growth spurt!"
1513,Ignatz: This place has so many breathtaking works of art. I feel like I'm living in a museum. Each piece can teach us about styles and techniques from a thousand years ago!
1514,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you know a lot about art?
Ignatz: I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art, but I won't pretend to be an expert.
Choice 2: Do you like art? (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Oh yes, very much. I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art."

1518,"Ignatz: Oh yes, very much. I'm from a family of merchants, so I've been able to see a lot of art."
1519,"Lysithea: Ah, Professor. It would seem that a minor lord in Faerghus is raising an army… This poses a threat, obviously. But not one for the Kingdom—for the church. I mean, Faerghus doesn’t even have a king at present. There’s something…unsettling about this army. You had better ensure we’re fully prepared."
1520,"Lysithea: The monastery grounds are far too spread out. Feels like it takes hours to get from one area to another. And, no, that's not because I'm getting lost. I'm a fully capable, mature person! Who never gets lost."
1521,"Marianne: Oh. Hello, Professor... Um. Was there something you needed?"
1522,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I came to see the horses. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures.
Choice 2: I'm just looking around.
Marianne: I see. I won't bother you, then..."
1523,"Choice 1: I came to see the horses. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures."
1524,Marianne: Oh! You like horses? I like them too. They're such kind creatures.
1525,"Choice 2: I'm just looking around.
Marianne: I see. I won't bother you, then..."
1526,"Marianne: I see. I won't bother you, then..."
1527,"Hilda: Professor, your clothes are a bit dirty. If you don't pay attention to your hygiene, the girls won't like you! I hate when my clothes get dirty. That's one of the many reasons I find it best to train as little as possible."
1528,"Leonie: I'm studying here so I can be the best there is, just like Captain Jeralt. Do you think I've got it in me to be a top tier mercenary, Professor?"
1529,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That depends on how hard you work.
Leonie: I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that.
Choice 2: You really want to bring the money in, huh? (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: I do! Though, it's about so much more than being rich. It's about honor."
1530,"Choice 1: That depends on how hard you work.
Leonie: I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that."
1531,"Leonie: I'm going to work a lot harder than all the fancy nobles around here, I can tell you that."

1533,"Leonie: I do! Though, it's about so much more than being rich. It's about honor."
1534,"Rhea: Pointing a sword at the Holy Church of Seiros is akin to pointing a sword at the goddess herself. Meting out appropriate punishments to the sinful... It is a sacred duty with which we have been entrusted. As a member of the church yourself, I hope that you will take that to heart."
1535,"Seteth: If you have a moment, I would like to have a word. It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards Flayn. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
1536,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not at all. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Choice 2: Actually..."
1537,Choice 1: Not at all. (Relationship with Seteth up)
1538,Choice 2: Actually...
1539,"Seteth: If you do see anyone getting too close with Flayn, please, inform me of it at once."
1540,"Seteth: If you have a moment, I would like to have a word. It has been brought to my attention that certain individuals have been making advances towards Flayn. Have you witnessed any such behavior?"
1541,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not at all.
Choice 2: Actually... (Relationship with Seteth up)"
1542,Choice 1: Not at all.
1543,Choice 2: Actually... (Relationship with Seteth up)
1544,"Seteth: If you see anything similar in the future, please inform the perpetrators of their peril."
1545,"Flayn: If the flowers within the greenhouse are removed, they will soon wilt and whither... Is that not so, Professor? I feel I can empathize with them... The flowers. Flowers that thrive–despite their environment–are truly inspiring, are they not?"
1546,"Alois: Past here is the Holy Mausoleum, where the saints of the Church of Seiros slumber. Sorry, but only a select few members of the church are allowed entry. It's open to the public on only one day of the year, for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth."
1547,Catherine: Here to train? You really are as hardworking as they say.
1548,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's an overstatement. I'm just me.
Catherine: Spoken like a true hard worker.
Choice 2: That's right. I'm a force of nature.
Catherine: Huh. Maybe the gossip's wrong. Hardworking people usually don't like to make a big fuss about it."
1549,"Choice 1: That's an overstatement. I'm just me.
Catherine: Spoken like a true hard worker."
1550,Catherine: Spoken like a true hard worker.

1552,Catherine: Huh. Maybe the gossip's wrong. Hardworking people usually don't like to make a big fuss about it.
1553,Jeritza: What? I desired fresh air.
1554,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's not like you.
Jeritza: True...
Choice 2: The wind feels nice.
Jeritza: Hmph."
1555,"Choice 1: That's not like you.
Jeritza: True..."
1556,Jeritza: True...
1557,"Choice 2: The wind feels nice.
Jeritza: Hmph."
1558,Jeritza: Hmph.
1559,"Jeralt: Castle Gaspard, eh? I've been there once before. Many years ago... It was by request of the son of that family... Christophe, I think it was."
1560,"Hanneman: I'm sorry, but I must vent to someone, Professor. You're familiar with Manuela's slovenly behavior, yes? That woman! She borrowed a book last week and returned it with stains of unknown origin on the cover, and several pages either folded or torn. Just now, she dropped a sandwich on the floor, picked it up and kept eating. When she saw my shock, she said simply, ""Three second rule."" Ugh!"
1561,"Manuela: Did you hear? There's news of someone in the Kingdom raising an army. The Kingdom, the Empire, the Alliance... They do love a good war, don't they? Spilling the blood of young men and women...and for what? Just to enjoy the horror of it?"
1562,"Tomas: Professor, I heard that you may battle alongside Catherine. Even among the knights, she is something special⁠—a holy knight who is able to wield a Hero's Relic. Still...she can be a mite difficult."
1563,"Anna: Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand."
1564,"Anna: Abyss? You're interested in that place, are you? Ancient sprawling remains deep below Garreg Mach... That's Abyss. Some folks have made their homes there. Obviously, they all have their reasons and tales to tell. But only the most enterprising merchant would venture near it. My advice? Avoid going there yourself."
1565,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Have you talked with Catherine yet? If the knights are the cream of the crop, she's the cream of the cream. Oh, and that Relic of hers! I hear it's nothing short of amazing."
1566,"Knight of Seiros: Since we're heading to Castle Gaspard, that means we'll be passing through Magdred Way. The road is well known for its beautiful surroundings. Depending on the time of year, it can be incredibly foggy, though. When it's like that you can't enjoy the lovely scenery... Lucky for us, it shouldn't be too foggy while we're there. Not that we'll have time for sightseeing anyway."
1567,"Knight of Seiros: I hear that Lord Lonato served the king of Faerghus's older brother when he was younger. Or something like that. He already had status and prestige, so why raise a rebellion? Eh, I guess it's none of my business."
1568,Knight of Seiros: Catherine has invited me to train with her. How much do you think I should train before I'm ready to train with someone that strong?
1569,Monk: Lord Lonato... He used to stay at the monastery rather frequently. He was such as pious man. A true believer... Such a terrible shame. I wonder what changed him...
1570,Monk: Next month is when a very important ceremony will be taking place at the monastery. Pilgrims from all corners of Fódlan have already started to gather in anticipation. I pray that you are able to nip this trouble in the bud as soon as possible.
1571,Shifty Merchant: Things we can't obtain here are likely obtainable by way of the underground. Are you unfamiliar with Garreg Mach's underground? The place is an absolute paradise for those who can't stay above ground.
1572,Monk: Those Abyssian idiots. All they ever do is cause trouble. We'd best purge the entire underbelly of Garreg Mach.
1573,"Yuri: Can't say I'm surprised about Lord Lonato launching a rebellion. The writing was on the wall. If anything, it's more surprising it didn't happen sooner."
1574,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You seem to know a fair bit about all this.
Yuri: Lord Lonato answers to Count Rowe of Faerghus, the man who adopted me. That's how I got into the academy. I'm not in contact with the count anymore, but that's how I know so much.
Choice 2: What writing on which wall? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: I'm not going to waste energy laying it out for you. Not much point, and you'll understand eventually."
1575,"Choice 1: You seem to know a fair bit about all this.

1578,"Yuri: I'm not going to waste energy laying it out for you. Not much point, and you'll understand eventually."
1579,Yuri: Gaspard territory smacks of war. It'll be interesting to see how things shake out.
1580,"Balthus: Hey, pal. Haven't seen any suspicious types on the surface lately, have you? Beefy, mean-looking folks?"
1581,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have not. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Beautiful. Guess those lowlifes haven't tracked me down yet.
Choice 2: I have.
Balthus: Damn. Guess those lowlifes finally tracked me down."
1582,"Choice 1: I have not. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Beautiful. Guess those lowlifes haven't tracked me down yet."
1583,Balthus: Beautiful. Guess those lowlifes haven't tracked me down yet.
1584,"Choice 2: I have.
Balthus: Damn. Guess those lowlifes finally tracked me down."
1585,Balthus: Damn. Guess those lowlifes finally tracked me down.
1586,"Balthus: Bounty hunters are the worst, yeah? They can't just let me be, so I have to go through the trouble of roughing 'em up."
1587,"Constance: Do you have some need of me? I assure you, I am busier than I may seem. Oh? You would argue the point? Do you claim to have a view inside my mind?"
1588,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: Yes, I thought not.
Choice 2: In fact, I do.
Constance: I warn you that I don't suffer fools."

Constance: I warn you that I don't suffer fools."
1592,Constance: I warn you that I don't suffer fools.
1593,"Constance: I'm doing strenuous mental exercises. My magical theories require rigorous fine-tuning. I shall never finish this task if I am not left to my own devices. Run along, now."
1594,"Hapi: Someone's raising an army in the Kingdom, I heard. Normally I wouldn't care about that kind of thing... But this army's picking a fight with the church, so as far as I'm concerned, more power to 'em."
1595,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You must really hate the church. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: Hate's a strong word.
Choice 2: You shouldn't say things like that.
Hapi: Hm, good point. Wouldn't want someone on Rhea's payroll to hear about my trash talk. Mum's the word."
1596,"Choice 1: You must really hate the church. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: Hate's a strong word."
1597,Hapi: Hate's a strong word.
1598,"Choice 2: You shouldn't say things like that.
Hapi: Hm, good point. Wouldn't want someone on Rhea's payroll to hear about my trash talk. Mum's the word."
1599,"Hapi: Hm, good point. Wouldn't want someone on Rhea's payroll to hear about my trash talk. Mum's the word."
1600,"Hapi: I'm just saying, they might have a good reason to rebel. Rhea and her lackeys like to pretend they're always in the right, but they're not. No one is."
1601,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports need to be reported. And for all reportable things, I'm your guy. Oh! Have you explored Abyss, yet? Some shiny treasures here. Much better than up top. Fact: treasure likes to be underground. You're one of those treasure snobs who thinks their treasure is better than everyone else's, are ya? Those types really get my goat."
1602,Thief: Mercy! I beg you! Kostas never meant to attack the church! He was tricked! They don't understand that. They'll kill me! But you... You can let me go! Please!
1603,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can't do that. (Relationship with Sothis up)
Thief: I...I understand. Then take me to the surface...
Choice 2: Never hurt anyone again.
Thief: I've got a quiet life waiting for me back home. I'll never cause trouble again, I swear. Thank you!"

1608,"Elderly Man: Despite what my appearance might suggest, I was actually born a noble. No one in my generation bore a Crest, however. When the next generation proved to be flush with Crests, my father and I were cast aside..."
1609,"Jeritza: There is solitude on the battlefield...but there are limits to what one can achieve alone. To be stronger, more efficient...visit the battalion guild."
1610,Jeritza: You went to the battalion guild... Track how your battalion and those of others are faring... Although solitude is the true battle...
1611,"Jeralt: Hey. It seems I've lost something. When you have a minute, can you help me look for it?"
1612,"Jeralt: That was helpful. Feels good, doesn't it? If you come across any more lost items, be sure to find their owner right away."
1613,"Mercedes: Those who struggle with private concerns will sometimes visit the cathedral for guidance. If you have the time, why not offer your keen insight, Professor?"
1614,Mercedes: Resolving other people's problems is difficult... You may be able to figure out what they're seeking if you become close enough to spend time alone with them.
1615,"Manuela: It's extremely important that professors tend to their own studies as well. If you agree, I'd be more than happy to share my knowledge."
1616,"Manuela: It's fun to learn like this, even as adults. How about we get others to join up as well? I'm sure they'll be elated to participate."
1617,"Dimitri: Hey, Professor! Have you heard of... Abyss? I don't know what it is, but ever since I heard the name, I've been curious about it! If you don't mind, could you do a little investigating?"
1618,"Claude: Hey, have you heard of Abyss? I was absolutely not eavesdropping on someone else when I heard the name, and I have to believe there's an interesting story there! Have you got some time to look into it, Professor?."
1619,"Edelgard: I've been hearing a lot about a place called Abyss lately. The name is unsettling, but I don't really know anything about it... If you have time, could you look into it for me?"
1620,House Lord: Abyss... A dangerous area below Garreg Mach that folks tend to avoid... I can't believe such a place has existed right under our noses!
1621,Dimitri: This might have an effect on public order beyond Garreg Mach too!
1622,Claude: Maybe one day I can help the whole story see the light of day.
1623,Edelgard: I wonder how much the archbishop knows about this.
1624,"Constance: You have heard tell of the secret roster, yes? It contains sensitive information about everyone that isn't available elsewhere. Alas, this precious document was stolen! You must recover it as soon as possible!"
1625,"Constance: What a relief! You know, you may find this useful as a resource in your work as an instructor. You'll prevent it from going missing again, I trust?"
1626,Yuri: A professor who was dismissed from his position at the Officers Academy has made his home here. He could be a kind of mentor to you. Talk to him—maybe you can learn a thing or two!
1627,"Yuri: How'd it go? Even though he has lost his job, he was widely recognized for his skill and knowledge. I'd say you can trust his analysis."
1628,"Hubert: No matter how powerful our enemies may be, there is no need to worry so long as we're with Catherine, the mighty wielder of Thunderbrand."
1629,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thunderbrand?
Choice 2: What are you talking about?"
1630,Choice 1: Thunderbrand?
1631,Choice 2: What are you talking about?
1632,"Catherine: You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight."
1633,Hubert: One must wonder why Lord Lonato would incite such a reckless rebellion.
1634,Catherine: It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...
1635,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've heard of it.
Edelgard: I remember that day well. No one saw it coming.
Choice 2: I don't know much about it."

Edelgard: I remember that day well. No one saw it coming."
1637,Edelgard: I remember that day well. No one saw it coming.
1638,Choice 2: I don't know much about it.
1639,"Edelgard: Roughly four years ago, the king of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. I believe that about sums it up, correct?"
1640,"Catherine: To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution."
1641,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The church executes criminals?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.
Choice 2: Why was the king targeted?
Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies."
1642,"Choice 1: The church executes criminals?

1645,"Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies."
1646,"Catherine: Whatever the truth behind that incident may be, Lord Lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since. Well... To be more specific, his grudge isn't only against the church. It's also against the one who turned Christophe over to them..."
1647,Church Soldier: Report! The enemy is approaching! They can't be avoided. Their numbers are far greatly than we predicted. They used the fog to slip past the knights' perimeter!
1648,"Catherine: It looks like our mission just changed, Professor. Everyone, prepare for battle!"
1649,"Dimitri: I have to say... It's a real honor to accompany such a brave and distinguished knight. None other than Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand!"

1654,Ashe: Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion?
1655,"Catherine: You should know more about that than any of us, Ashe."
1656,"Ashe: Well, I don't. Lonato never mentioned anything of the like to me."
1657,Dimitri: He probably didn't want you getting caught up in his own personal vendetta.
1658,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is Ashe related to Lord Lonato?
Ashe: I'm Lonato's adopted son. He raised me as though I were his own blood. He was always so kind. I don't understand... I guess it has to do with Christophe.
Choice 2: What vendetta?"
1659,"Choice 1: Is Ashe related to Lord Lonato?

1664,Choice 1: I've heard of it.
1665,Choice 2: I don't know much about it.
1666,Catherine: It's when the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was...was murdered by the people of Duscur. It happened about four years ago... (Catherine looks at Dimitri)
1667,"Dimitri: It's OK, Catherine. Please, go on."
1668,"Catherine: Right. Well, Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was accused of being involved in that whole awful affair. He was executed by the church."
1669,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The church executes prisoners?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.
Choice 2: Why was the king targeted?
Dimitri: ...
Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies."

1673,Dimitri: ...
1674,"Catherine: King Lambert was attempting a major political reform. Needless to say, he had many enemies."
1675,"Catherine: Whatever the truth behind that incident may be, Lord Lonato has harbored resentment to the church ever since. Well... To be more specific, his grudge isn't only against the church. It's also against the one who turned Christophe over to them..."
1676,Church Soldier: Report! The enemy is approaching! They can't be avoided. Their numbers are far greatly than we predicted. They used the fog to slip past the knights' perimeter!
1677,"Catherine: It looks like our mission just changed, Professor. Everyone, prepare for battle!"
1678,"Claude: It really is an honor to accompany Catherine, wielder of Thunderbrand. I hear you're intimidating enough to silence the howling winds!"
1679,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thunderbrand?
Choice 2: What are you talking about?"
1680,Choice 1: Thunderbrand?
1681,Choice 2: What are you talking about?
1682,"Catherine: You mean you don't know? My weapon is called Thunderbrand. It's one of the Hero's Relics. A long, long time ago, the goddess bestowed divine weapons upon 10 heroes, which were passed down to their descendants. It's an honor to wield, but I'm afraid there won't be any chance for that today. Our mission is to help clean up the aftermath, not to fight."
1683,Claude: Why would Lonato incite such a reckless rebellion? He had to have known he had no chance of winning.
1684,Catherine: It all goes back to the Tragedy of Duscur...
1685,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've heard of it. (continued below)
Choice 2: I don't know much about it.
Claude: You must be joking. Where have you been traveling that news of it didn't reach you?"

1689,"Claude: It happened about four years ago. The king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus was murdered by the people of Duscur. That about covers it, right?"
1690,"Catherine: To put it simply, yes. But there's more to that story. They had accomplices within the Kingdom as well. Lord Lonato's son, Christophe, was one of them, and so he was handed over to the church for execution."
1691,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The church executes criminals?
Catherine: Speaking from the church's perspective, we simply passed judgement according to our doctrine in place of the Kingdom, which was in complete chaos.

1702,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
1703,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude falls in battle.
1704,"Catherine: With this fog, it's impossible to tell where the enemy might be...or how many of them there are. The enemy could be trying to surround us, but they shouldn't have enough soldiers to form a tight circle. Take down anyone who breaks through the fog, and let's push through!"
1705,"Black Eagles
Edelgard: That smell... It's fresh blood. It seems the battle has already started within the fog."

1710,Claude: The conditions are the same for both sides... But we're at a disadvantage for not knowing the terrain.
1711,Catherine: Proceed with caution! Wait for them to enter your field of view.
1712,Militia:  Lord Lonato doesn't deserve such sadness and anger... Now it's your turn to suffer!
1713,"Ashe: (If Ashe is present in your party)  Why, Lonato? Why did you drag so many others into this?"
1714,Militia: You would think we're just gonna do nothing while you try to kill our lord?!
1715,Gaspard Commander: I won't let you anywhere near Lord Lonato!
1716,Narration: The fog is lifting as a result of the Dark Mage being defeated! It seems the fog was being caused by magic.
1717,Lonato:  The fog has cleared. There's nothing left to hide you or the filthy Central Church from the judgement of the goddess!
1718,"Militia: Lord Lonato... Please, don't die..."
1719,"Black Eagles
Edelgard: I'm sorry, but I don't believe Lord Lonato has the strength to carry on."

1724,"Claude:  The nobles start the war, but it's the commoners who spill their blood first..."
1725,"Lonato:  You! I will be the one to kill you, no other!"
1726,Catherine:  You have lost all sense of justice.  You want to fight me? So be it. I'll send you to meet your goddess.
1727,"Lonato:  Stand down, Ashe. I must destroy these evil-doers by any means necessary!"
1728,"Ashe:  Please surrender, Lonato! Whatever your reason for doing this, we can still talk it out!"
1729,Lonato:  Rhea is an infidel who has deceived the people and desecrated the goddess! We have virtue and the goddess herself on our side!
1730,"Ashe:  Even if all that's true, dragging the townsfolk into it like this isn't right!"
1731,"Lonato:  Enough. If that is how you feel, prepare yourself! I'm putting an end to this!"
1732,"Lonato: I apologize, Your Highness. It is regrettable that we should cross swords like this."
1733,"Dimitri: Lonato, I sympathize with your position. I really do. I have no wish to kill you, but I am afraid you have left me no choice. Please...forgive me."
1734,"Lonato: Your Highness... I cannot stop here. For my child, and for the people of Fódlan. If you will not stand aside, then I have no choice but to cut you down."
1735,Lonato:  You have been deceived by that witch... I will show you the truth!
1736,Lonato: (If Ashe is present)  That vile woman... Christophe... Forgive me...
1737,"Ashe: (if present)  Lonato, I..."
1738,"Catherine:  I never thought I'd see Lonato meet this fate.  Well done, everyone. Let's gather our troops and go."
1739,Caspar: Damn it! It was all so pointless. I've never seen so many people utterly heartbroken...
1740,"Ferdinand: Forcing innocent citizens to risk their lives... That man was not a noble, but a monster."
1741,Hubert: What could have pushed Lord Lonato to this point?
1742,Edelgard: Everyone was a bit shaken by the militia fighting alongside our enemies.
1743,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No used dwelling on it.
Choice 2: That is the reality of battle."
1744,Choice 1: No used dwelling on it.
1745,Choice 2: That is the reality of battle.
1746,"Edelgard: If only everyone could face reality so unflinchingly. The commoners who allied themselves with Lord Lonato believed they were fighting for a just cause. It would be disrespectful to consider them simply victims when they died for what they believed in. Still, we have no choice but to eliminate those who cling to unreasonable ideas of justice. Even if our enemies are the gods themselves...we must never lose sight of our goal."
1747,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's taking it a bit far.
Edelgard: Is it? Such a day may come, whether you expect it or not. You should be ready.
Choice 2: Agreed. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: I'm surprised to hear you say that."
1748,"Choice 1: That's taking it a bit far.
Edelgard: Is it? Such a day may come, whether you expect it or not. You should be ready."
1749,"Edelgard: Is it? Such a day may come, whether you expect it or not. You should be ready."
1750,"Choice 2: Agreed. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: I'm surprised to hear you say that."
1751,Edelgard: I'm surprised to hear you say that.
1752,"Edelgard: Really, I'm just like Lonato. I, too, will be the sort of ruler who's willing to risk the lives of my citizens in service of a higher cause. It's not possible to change the world without sacrifice. Dying for the greater good is not a death in vain."
1753,Catherine: Professor... I'm afraid this incident is far more serious than anticipated.
1754,"Catherine: I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing..."
1755,"Ashe: Why... Why did this happen? Lonato was always such a kind man... Everyone in the village was...was so nice to me. And I...I killed them. I killed them all! I had to, I know I had to... I know that! But still... What does that make me?"
1756,"Dimitri: Please, don't beat yourself up, Ashe. We did what had to be done."
1757,Ashe: I'm...I'm sorry. I shouldn't be bothering you. I'm...I'm going to check on the town. I hope my brother and sister are OK. (Ashe quickly leaves)
1758,Dimitri: That...that was my first time killing civilians too... Those who I'm sworn to protect.
1759,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It was a necessary sacrifice.
Choice 2: That is the reality of war."
1760,Choice 1: It was a necessary sacrifice.
1761,Choice 2: That is the reality of war.
1762,"Dimitri: Are you insane?! Those weren't knights or soldiers, but fathers and sons! We...we shouldn't have killed them. We should have found another way... I...I'm sorry. It's not fair for me to blame you for the circumstance. I know that if we hadn't...done what we did, even more civilian lives would have been lost. At least, my mind understands that. But...my heart... Professor... Those in power, no matter the era, always claim they fight for a just cause. That they take life to protect it. But... Is it truly OK to take any life you please, all in service of some implacable ""just cause""? Lord Lonato didn't take up arms out of a lust for power. He simply believed his cause to be just. Who's to say it wasn't? Maybe we didn't have to cut him down like that. Maybe we could have reached a mutual understanding...found a path of peace. I...I have to believe that. Perhaps the notion sounds laughable to you. Mere lip service to naive ideals. But I can't believe otherwise."
1763,"Catherine: Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated."
1764,"Catherine: I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing..."
1765,"Claude: Nice work, Teach. Still...that fight left a foul taste in my mouth. That aside, did you see how Catherine fought?"
1766,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She's incredible.
Claude: Agreed. I thought the power of the Heroes' Relics must be exaggerated, but I was clearly wrong.
Choice 2: I'm stronger.
Claude: Ha! I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics. They're on a whole different level."
1767,"Choice 1: She's incredible.
Claude: Agreed. I thought the power of the Heroes' Relics must be exaggerated, but I was clearly wrong."
1768,"Claude: Agreed. I thought the power of the Heroes' Relics must be exaggerated, but I was clearly wrong."
1769,"Choice 2: I'm stronger.
Claude: Ha! I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics. They're on a whole different level."
1770,"Claude: Ha! I love the confidence, Teach. But you're no match for the Heroes' Relics. They're on a whole different level."
1771,Claude: Makes you wonder about that legend...
1772,Byleth: What legend?
1773,"Claude: Oh, it's nothing. Just the usual fanciful nonsense. An ancient Relic that once cut a mountain in half with a single swing. That's what they say, anyway. But as amazing as Thunderbrand is, I don't think it fits that description. Apparently, Relics can harness tremendous power for those with a compatible Crest. Though you can technically use one so long as you have any Crest at all. I dunno. Long story short, I'd like to try cutting a mountain in half someday."
1774,"Hilda: Ooh! Are you talking about Relics? You'll be able to wield one soon, Claude! I just know it! After all, you've already been selected as the next head of House Riegan!"
1775,"Claude: Easy there, Hilda. I don't know how apt ""soon"" is. My grandfather is still unbearably healthy. Oh? Is this news to you, Teach? Yours truly was recently recognized as a legitimate child of House Riegan. They possess one of the Heroes' Relics too, though I've yet to see it."
1776,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Just recently?
Claude: I officially joined House Riegan only last year. Before then, I lived with my father.
Choice 2: You haven't seen it?
Claude: I was raised by my father. House Riegan is on my mother's side of the family."
1777,"Choice 1: Just recently?
Claude: I officially joined House Riegan only last year. Before then, I lived with my father."
1778,"Claude: I officially joined House Riegan only last year. Before then, I lived with my father."
1779,"Choice 2: You haven't seen it?
Claude: I was raised by my father. House Riegan is on my mother's side of the family."
1780,Claude: I was raised by my father. House Riegan is on my mother's side of the family.
1781,"Claude: When I learned that my mother was the daughter of an Alliance noble, I was so surprised I thought the whole world was pulling a fast one on me for a week."
1782,"Hilda: So that means your mother is Duke Riegan's daughter, right? Where is she now?"
1783,Claude: I can't say. My mother's currently living in a different world than the one she grew up in and has no desire to return home.
1784,"Hilda: Um, OK. You sure have a lot of secrets, don't you?"
1785,"Claude: I'm just keeping a promise to my parents. Make of that whatever you will. In exchange for my so-called secrecy, I'm free to do as I please, which is why I decided to see what the other side of my family was like. That's how I found out about this strange Crest I bear..."
1786,"Leonie: Professor, Claude. It sounds like the troops will be withdrawing soon. We should return as well."
1787,"Ignatz: We won. We should be celebrating. Instead, we're heading back with heavy hearts..."
1788,"Claude: Whoa there! What's the matter? You look as sad as a kitten without any yarn. If we hadn't done what we did, the rebel army would have followed this road all the way to the monastery. And they would have crushed all the little villages along the way. We stopped that from happening. You should be proud."
1789,"Catherine: Sorry to intrude, but this incident may be more serious than anticipated."
1790,"Catherine: I found this on Lord Lonato. It's a note that mentions a plan to assassinate Lady Rhea. We can't tell who sent it, so the source is suspect, but the content is too disturbing to ignore. We must report this to Lady Rhea right away. I hope that it's nothing..."
1791,"Rhea: I am glad to see that you have returned safely. The goddess is gracious with her divine protection. But it was not only her divine protection that shielded you, was it? You are just as skilled as I had hoped."
1792,"Byleth:
Choice 1: My students deserve the praise.
Rhea: I am not so sure.
Choice 2: I still have much to learn.
Rhea: There is no need for modesty."
1793,"Choice 1: My students deserve the praise.
Rhea: I am not so sure."
1794,Rhea: I am not so sure.
1795,"Choice 2: I still have much to learn.
Rhea: There is no need for modesty."
1796,Rhea: There is no need for modesty.
1797,"Rhea: I heard some of the students were...hesitant about fighting militia. However, we must punish any sinner who may inflict harm upon believers, even if those sinners are civilians. I pray the students learned a valuable lesson about the fate that awaits all who are foolish enough to point their blades towards the heavens."
1798,"Seteth: Our real concern is what Catherine reported. The secret message that was in Lord Lonato's possession. It contained a deplorable plot to target the archbishop on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth. The plan seems unrealistic at best, but a threat is a threat. We must maintain constant vigilance. To that end, I would like for you and your students to help with security on the day of the ritual."
1799,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You can count on us.
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
Choice 2: We won't let her down. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
Choice 3: Won't that endanger the students?
Rhea: Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side."
1800,"Choice 1: You can count on us.
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude."
1801,Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
1802,"Choice 2: We won't let her down. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude."
1803,Rhea: That is most reassuring. You have my gratitude.
1804,"Choice 3: Won't that endanger the students?
Rhea: Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side."
1805,"Rhea: Even if they encounter an enemy whom they cannot best, they should be fine so long as they have you on their side."
1806,"Seteth: The Rite of Rebirth is of paramount importance. It is when the Church of Seiros and its believers unite to pray for the return of the goddess. The archbishop and I will be confined to the Goddess Tower once the ritual begins. Of course, the knights will be on high alert as well, but there aren't enough of them to keep watch on every corner of the monastery. It is far from ideal to be forced to mobilize students, but the gravity of this situation requires that we all bend to avoid breaking."
1807,"Rhea: While there is no need to fear for my safety, we cannot turn a blind eye to those who would blaspheme so heinously."
1808,"Seteth: With any luck, this will all be for naught. Still, be on your guard."
1809,"As the sun grows stronger and the nights grow ever shorter, the Blue Sea Star returns to the sky once more. Believed to be the goddess's home, her followers look to the star and commence celebrations of her rebirth. On the grounds of Garreg Mach Monastery, a grand ceremony is held in honor of this much anticipated event. Every true follower of the Church of Seiros is sure to be in attendance.

1842,"Leonie: Seems like donations to the monastery aren't actually kept here. That means the enemy isn't likely to be interested in money. We should turn our attention elsewhere. Then again, I guess some of the plants in the greenhouse could sell for a lot. But that can't really be it, can it?

1890,Edelgard: Our mission this month is to patrol and set up defenses to stop the assassination plot.
1891,Hubert: I wonder if an assassination attempt is truly the goal of our enemy...
1892,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Edelgard: You must sense that something's off about all of this.

1896,"Edelgard: Yes, I think so too."
1897,"Edelgard: A barely concealed secret message, trying to distract us from whatever's really going on. Sloppy, to say the least. And while everyone is out searching for a phantom assassin, they'll be free to accomplish their true goal with ease."
1898,Ferdinand: The monastery houses many valuable weapons. Perhaps that is their aim?
1899,Dorothea: I hear the monastery has a treasure vault too. Seems like the sort of place a foe would like some alone time in.
1900,"Linhardt: Garreg Mach is immense, and not just above ground but below as well. Perhaps their aim lies beneath the monastery..."
1901,"Hubert: It seems to me that we should search the monastery for a clue as to what the enemy might be after. Of course, we must never underestimate the need for preparedness, in case a battle should ensue."
1902,"Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir."
1903,Edelgard: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man is-

1911,"Shamir: Cyril adores Rhea. That aside, if you need anything, ask."
1912,"Dimitri: So, our task for this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery, to help put a stop to that assassination plot. The knights will certainly have their hands full protecting Lady Rhea. Perhaps our enemy is counting on that..."
1913,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Dedue: Your Highness, I am curious as to what you mean by that.
Choice 2: I agree. (Relationship with Dimitri up)

1916,"Choice 2: I agree. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dedue: Please, elaborate."
1917,"Dedue: Please, elaborate."
1918,Dimitri: Why would Lord Lonato be carrying around a secret note with an assassination plot written on it? Isn't it possible he hoped to monopolize everyone's attention with this alleged plot...in order to distract from his true aim?
1919,Annette: Maybe they're after the treasure vault. There's also lots of valuable stuff in the library and Professor Hanneman's quarters!
1920,Felix: True. The monastery undoubtedly houses many weapons that rival even the Heroes' Relics.
1921,"Sylvain: Whatever their aim, we can't allow any harm to come to the ladies of the monastery. I mean, what would I do with my spare time?"
1922,Dedue: You mean to say we should search the monastery. Try to find what the enemy is truly after.
1923,"Dimitri: Yes. And we should be prepared to fight them as well, should it come to that. I wouldn't mind getting in some training, just in case."
1924,"Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir."
1925,Dimitri: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And this young man here is–

1934,"Claude: OK... So our task this moon is to patrol and guard the monastery in support of the knights, who are busy trying to stop an assassination plot. Here's the thing. I don't think the bad guys are really trying to assassinate the archbishop."
1935,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Claude: Come on, Teach. Don't you think that ""secret"" note Lord Lonato was carrying around was just a little too obvious?

1940,Claude: People don't just carry around secret notes. Someone wanted us to find it.
1941,Ignatz: Do you really think the assassination plot is just a distraction?
1942,"Hilda: Oh, yeah. That makes complete sense. But then...what are they really after?"
1943,"Claude: If I knew that, I wouldn't be so worried. Let's see... It probably involves somewhere that will be empty during the Rite of Rebirth, yeah?"
1944,"Lysithea: Since the ceremony is at the Goddess Tower, it follows that everywhere else at the academy will be severely understaffed."
1945,Leonie: Do you think they're after the church's donation money? I hear noble families tend to donate quite generously.
1946,Raphael: My bet's on the dining hall. It's a treasure trove of delicious food. Makes me angry just thinking about them getting their grubby hands on it!
1947,Hilda: Let's split up and look around! I'll keep an eye on the reception hall.
1948,"Claude: You should get in some training if you have the time, Hilda. There's a good chance we'll have to fight."
1949,"Hilda: Uh! Well, I'm not the only one who needs to train here! It's not right to single me out like that."
1950,"Shamir: A secret meeting, Professor? Oh, we haven't been introduced. I am Shamir."
1951,Claude: Shamir is one of the Knights of Seiros. And that little go-getter there is–

1967,"Edelgard: Our enemy's true target... What could it be? The monastery has been around for nearly a millennium. It's only logical that there are secrets here. We'd better investigate. Would you mind asking around and seeing what you can dig up? Once you've uncovered some leads, we'll regroup."
1968,Edelgard: We need more information. Is there anyone else you could talk to?
1969,"Edelgard: Hmm... There's a place that the church values above all others. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make it much easier than usual to access."

1977,"Edelgard: We can't know for certain, but it's a distinct possibility that the Holy Mausoleum is our enemy's target."
1978,"Edelgard: Oh, have you been tasked with guarding the monastery as well? Such a stir over a single letter...but I suppose the archbishop's safety is too important to risk."
1979,"Dimitri: If the enemy's aim lies elsewhere, we had better discern their true intent quickly. As I see it, our best option is to explore every inch of the monastery. We should also speak to everyone here. Let's plan to compare notes once you've got a lead."
1980,Dimitri: Hmm. I'm afraid we'll need more information than that. Is there anyone else you could try speaking to?
1981,"Dimitri: So... There is something that the church values above all else. On the day of the rite, it will be open to the public. That will make gaining entry far easier than usual. You know the place of which I speak..."

1990,"Dimitri: All this talk of assassination plots... It brings back dark memories I prefer to keep buried. I doubt there is any correlation, and yet... Ah, it is nothing. I am sorry for allowing my mind to wander. My focus should be solely on guarding the monastery right now."
1991,"Claude: To figure out our foe's intentions, we need information. Lot's of it. Or any, at the least. For now, try going around the monastery and looking for suspicious locations. You should also try chatting folks up to see if they know anything. Once we've got things narrowed down, let's meet up and compare notes."
1992,"Claude: Hmm... We still don't have enough to go on, Teach. Let's try looking around a little more."
1993,"Claude: Hmm. Something the church values above all else... And on the day of the rite, it'll be open to the public, making it easier than ever to get inside. That's gotta be it, right?"

2002,Claude: There's been talk of an attempt on Rhea's life. We've been order to help the knights patrol. Could that possibly mean that Rhea isn't beloved by everyone the world over?
2003,Hubert: Can you imagine the archbishop being murdered? I prefer not to consider such a gruesome scenario.
2004,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course not. (Relationship with Hubert up)
Hubert: Awfully calm, aren't you? I wonder what it takes to rile you up.
Choice 2: Frightening thought.

2008,"Hubert: That easy to get under your skin, is it?"
2009,"Ferdinand: Hmm... Setting fire to the stables to distract everyone, to cause a commotion. It is the oldest trick in the book, but I cannot shake the thought that our enemies may attempt it... I will stand guard and watch over the stable...and the knights' horses. They are truly magnificent."
2010,Linhardt: So sleepy... Too sleepy... I found an interesting book in the library. Got so caught up reading it I forgot to sleep... Interesting discovery though–the coffins of the Four Saints in the sanctum each have their Crests carved into them. I'll need to find a way down there to get a look.
2011,"Caspar: Oh. Hey, Professor. I was just reading this letter from my father. Do you know him? He's a pretty big deal in the Empire. He only writes to ask how my training's going, or how many monsters I've killed. Stuff like that."
2012,"Bernadetta: Um... Hi. Right now is, um... Well, right now's OK I guess. If you, um, want to chat...a little."
2013,Byleth: Didn't I see you in the dining hall last night?
2014,"Bernadetta: Hey, I get hungry sometimes. Like anyone else! What? Eating at night is bad for you? There's no way that's true. Wait, really?"
2015,"Dorothea: People die in every battle. And it can be by sword or spear or magic, but... But depending on who it is that died... Depending on who died, it's different."
2016,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Choice 2: It's different if it's someone you know who was lost... (Relationship with Dorothea up)"

2019,Dorothea: I hope nothing bad happens this month.
2020,Dorothea: Is it true you got caught in the fighting? I'm so thankful you made it out alive. I don't know what we would do if we lost you...
2021,Petra: In Brigid... assassinations are many. I have also been the targeted back in the past.
2022,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How frightening.
Choice 2: I'm happy you survived. (Relationship with Petra up)"
2023,Choice 1: How frightening.
2024,Choice 2: I'm happy you survived. (Relationship with Petra up)
2025,Petra: The Goddess Tower has an entrance of narrowness. That is most good. The windows are not the most good though. A target of ease for snipers.
2026,"Petra: Fighting to stop a murdering is my specialness...no, my specialty. I will show my best work!"
2027,"Dedue: The monks declined my offer of assistance. They said that no one from Duscur is to be trusted, especially now. Given the circumstances, I cannot fault them."
2028,"Felix: Sending an assassin to the monastery, hm? Hopefully it's someone worth crossing blades with."
2029,"Byleth:

2033,Felix: You're entitled to your opinion.
2034,"Felix: Lord Lonato's rebellion may have been quelled, but the unrest in Faerghus isn't dying down anytime soon. The boar prince should hurry up and claim the throne, rather than letting old customs hold him back."
2035,"Ashe: I can't stop thinking about Lonato... I'm sorry, Professor. I know this isn't the time, but... I just can't get past it."

2038,Choice 2: Pull yourself together. (Relationship with Ashe up)
2039,"Ashe: Thank you. No matter what happens, I promise you I'll do my part. I checked on my brother and sister who were living in Castle Gaspard. Thankfully they're all right. I was worried because they're both so young, but the church in the castle town offered to take them in. That much, at least, is a big relief."
2040,"Sylvain: No classes on a festival day! I thought I'd get to spend all day relaxing in the company of some lovely ladies, but now this has happened. Hey, Professor, I know there's talk of an assassination attempt, but do you really think they'll do it on the day of the Rite of Rebirth? I feel like security would be looser some other time. Is there some reason why it has to happen on that day?"
2041,"Mercedes: The monastery holds many treasures. Maybe the enemy is after one of those? Even so, the idea of stealing from the church is just horrible..."
2042,"Annette: I bought the ingredients for making some sweet treats I can't wait to eats! Huh? Oh! I know it looks like I'm fooling around, but I'm not. I'm preparing for potential battle during my patrol by making sure I have plenty of food I can eat while walking. Smart, huh?"
2043,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Good thinking. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: I know! Once they're ready, I promise to share some with you.

2047,"Annette: I just thought I'd be more alert if I had something sweet in my tummy. Oh, wait! Was it spicy food that you liked, Professor?"
2048,Annette: Have you heard? Rumor has it that death himself has been appearing in Garreg Mach. They say he appears every night and kidnaps folks. I wonder what happens to them…
2049,"Ingrid: Professor, while the investigation is important, don't forget to make time for your training. If we have to battle and cannot win, all will be lost. We don't know who our enemy is, so we must be prepared for anything."
2050,Ingrid: Lady Rhea lifts the spirits of all the people of Fódlan. We cannot allow her to come to any harm.
2051,"Lorenz: Are we really just taking Claude's word for it? If so, I doubt anything will come of this. It is all probably just some sort of distasteful joke. I find it highly unlikely that anyone would be foolish enough to barge in here and cause a disturbance."
2052,Lorenz: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is the most significant ritual for the Church of Seiros. Could it be that someone has spread these rumors of an assassination plot merely with the intention to hinder the celebration?
2053,"Raphael: I bet the enemy's using this assassination nonsense just to sneak in and raid the pantry. What do you think, Professor?"
2054,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You may be right. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Oh, I'm right all right. My animal instinct is telling me that the enemy is after our best meats.

2059,"Ignatz: The monastery's so big. How can we narrow down the list of possible targets? The only places I can think of are the vault and the library, and… I guess that's it."
2060,"Ignatz: With the whole monastery preparing for the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth this month, it feels like everyone's a little on edge…"
2061,"Lysithea: I don't know who to blame for all this commotion, but it's frankly a huge inconvenience. With everyone stuck on guard duty, our study and training time has been drastically reduced."

The timing was improper, and I regret it very much now. Oh, but more importantly, this place is off limits, Professor. It is only open to the public on the day of the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth."
2089,"Alois: Have you visited the Goddess Tower? It's a sacred place, used for rituals and the like. In general, students aren't allowed entry. But as you'd expect, that rule just excites their curiosity. Some have even tried sneaking in. Well, at least for this month, that kind of behavior is totally unthinkable. We have a lot more security, what with the Goddess's Rite of Rebirth coming up."

2096,"Catherine: Hey, Professor. You're good-looking, you know that? At the same time, you look like someone who was born to fight. I bet we'd get along. I'm also good-looking and born to fight, heh? Need any help with your class?
Accept"
2097,Accept
2098,Catherine: Feel free to call on me when a fight's brewing. Thunderbrand and I will be there when you need us.
2099,"Shamir: You spend too much time roaming the monastery. If you're looking for something, try less aimless wandering."
2100,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I was thinking about the enemy's objective. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Do you even know who the enemy is? You can't know why without knowing who.
Choice 2: I'm not looking for anything.
Shamir: Sure."
2101,"Choice 1: I was thinking about the enemy's objective. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Do you even know who the enemy is? You can't know why without knowing who."

2103,"Choice 2: I'm not looking for anything.
Shamir: Sure."
2104,Shamir: Sure.
2105,Shamir: It's none of my business anyway. I'm just here to take care of enemies who get too close.
2106,Jeritza: You're skilled. Why won't you battle me? Hmph.
2107,"Jeralt: What's the matter? You're running all over creation. Ah... You don't believe Lady Rhea is the real target, do you? Even so, the knights have their orders. We can't abandon our duty to guard Lady Rhea. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is an important event for the Church of Seiros. They say it's the day when the goddess will return to walk among us. Not too likely, if you ask me. Uh... Best if you keep that to yourself."
2108,"Hanneman: Unbelievable. What a terrifying story. However, an assassination attempt on Lady Rhea is doomed to fail. Pardon? You think the goal may be different than simple assassination? Intriguing. I suppose the priceless objects in this room could perhaps draw thieves. However, there's no one but me who could make use of them..."
2109,Gained Investigation Note #1
2110,"Manuela: Professor. I hope you're well. As for me, I had a date with a splendid specimen of a knight. But now he's suddenly not in the mood to see me again. I blame all these rumors of a deathly figure showing up in town. Such an uproar must have, beyond reason, drawn his attention away from me."
2111,"Tomas: I hear you have fought alongside Catherine. I would wager that her power exceeded your expectations. Had you the chance to witness her Relic? Thunderbrand, glowing red... That glow is a sure sign that her blood contains a Crest that harmonizes with that Hero's Relic."
2112,"Cyril: Excuse me, Professor? I just wanted to let you know that Lady Rhea is always real concerned with you. She expects great things, I think. Please don't let her down, OK?"
2113,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course not. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: I hope you're not just saying that.
Choice 2: We'll see...
Cyril: Ya know what? I'm watching you."
2114,"Choice 1: Of course not. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: I hope you're not just saying that."
2115,Cyril: I hope you're not just saying that.
2116,"Choice 2: We'll see...
Cyril: Ya know what? I'm watching you."
2117,Cyril: Ya know what? I'm watching you.
2118,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is this month, right? The monastery gates will be thrown wide open on that day! I'll be working as a guide. I hope I get to guide some lovely ladies around... Heh heh..."
2119,"Squire: The goddess's home is in the sky! She lives on a bright and shining star! But in the spring, you can't see that star. That means she can't protect Fódlan. That's why we all celebrate the day when her star returns to the sky! That's the day of the Rite of Rebirth! See, see? I've been studying! I know just about everything!"
2120,"Knight of Seiros: People seem to think that all the Knights of Seiros are equal, but that isn't quite so. There are many distinguishing ranks within the order. For example, there are squires, who are training to become knights, as well as full knights, like myself. Oh, and then we have the holy knights, such as Catherine. Those are the knights that can wield a Hero's Relic."
2121,"Priest: About 20 or so years ago there was a big fire in Garreg Mach. On that day, Captain Jeralt went missing. Everyone thought he was dead... It never occurred to me that he might actually have survived. The truly strange part is that, in all those years, he hasn't changed a bit..."
2122,"Knight of Seiros: On the day of the rite, the monastery will be open to the public, including the Holy Mausoleum. The Holy Mausoleum is where the tomb of the divine Seiros lies. There she slumbers, eternally. That's...pretty much all that in there. Just an ancient coffin. It's sealed with a powerful magic, to protect against would-be grave robbers."
2123,Gained Investigation Note #3 x1
2124,"Knight of Seiros: Have you heard of the War of the Eagle and Lion? It was the battle that won the Kingdom its independence from the Empire. Even the Church of Seiros had no choice but to recognize the courage of Loog, the King of Lions, who emerged victorious. The church awarded him a crown and the right to govern the Faerghus region, backing him in his bid to found the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. In return, Loog agreed to make the Church of Seiros the religion of his territory, and permitted them to publicly proselytize across the Kingdom. In the 400 years since, the church and the Kingdom have continued to maintain very close relations."
2125,"Knight of Seiros: Something in the monastery that someone might go after? There's so much here I couldn't possibly name just one. Even this here kitchen contains previous wares. Wine bottles from centuries past and the like. I hear that stuff is fancy, but not very drinkable. I doubt anyone would go to the trouble of stealing it."
2126,Gained Investigation Note #5 x1
2127,Monk: It would be terrible if the greenhouse was targeted. The plants in here are incredibly valuable. This place contains the heart of Garreg Mach's 995-year history! So many beautiful flowers... Plants that can save or end lives... They are all my precious children.
2128,Gained Investigation Note #7 x1
2129,"Knight of Seiros: I have heard talk of students wandering the monastery late at night. They wouldn't happen to be from your class, would they? Please keep your students in line, Professor. Kids these days..."
2130,"Priest: Do you know what this room is? It is the church's treasure vault. I say treasure, but I do not mean silver and gold and jewels. It mostly contains weapons, artifacts, and the like. Anything that would cause too great a stir should it be stolen? No. The church knows better than to store anything too valuable in such an accessible location."
2131,Gained Investigation Note #4 x1
2132,"Monk: There are numerous books in this library that you cannot find anywhere else. But once you are here, you can read them easily enough. I doubt someone would go to the trouble of stealing one. Sometimes Seteth will dispose of books that are deemed inappropriate for the monastery, but that's about it. In a way, I suppose that makes those particular volumes more valuable... Right?"
2133,Gained Investigation Note #6 x1
2134,"Monk: That boy who assists the archbishop... Cyril, I believe? I hear he's originally from a foreign land to the east called Almyra. I know he's still only a child, but I do wonder about his true intentions..."
2135,"Yuri: I've got my ideas about the people after Lady Rhea, but even I don't know how this'll shake out. I don't seem very devout, do I? Heh. Even so, I'd hate to see anything happen to the archibishop(sic). That secret message is suspicious—to take it at face value seems...unwise."
2136,"Balthus: I hear some thieves are targeting the monastery. I been feeling restless lately, so if you want some help unleashing on those jerks, just say the word."
2137,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'd appreciate that. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Oooh, this could be fun. Now I've just got to figure out where they'll be coming from...
Choice 2: You should settle down.
Balthus: What?! You can't expect me to hold back, yeah? ...Oh, I see. You want me to put them on ice first. Make 'em beg a bit. Heh, I hear ya loud and clear."
2138,"Choice 1: I'd appreciate that. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Oooh, this could be fun. Now I've just got to figure out where they'll be coming from..."

2142,"Balthus: My fists are itching for a brawl. Hopefully, I'll get first crack at those poor fools..."
2143,"Constance: First the uprising, and now all this talk of an assassination? What is the world coming to? I should offer my magical services, just in case."
2144,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No one asked for that.
Constance: Well, that's a fine thing to say! You haven't even asked what sort of magic I propose!
Choice 2: What kind of services? (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: I've devised a spell to trick flowers into behaving like guard dogs. At the first sign of an intruder, the petals burst open, releasing their pollen! Uhh...I'm...I'm still fine-tuning it."
2145,"Choice 1: No one asked for that.

2149,"Hapi: Not to be disrespectful, but the Rite of Rebirth seems kinda silly. What, the goddess is reborn every year? Although... Hey, if you do run into her, let me know. I'd like to have a word. I bet she'll be pretty upset to learn what the church has been doing in her name."
2150,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I'm what you might call the chosen one. The alpha of Abyss. The reaper and the keeper. That said, I've had some unnecessary backup recently."
2151,Knight of Seiros: Lord Seteth requested my presence. There's an important ceremony happening this month.
2152,Abysskeeper: If only my backup had been a lovely lady with a thing for watchmen. We could have had a love story for the ages...
2153,Mysterious Woman: This god statue speaks to me in a strange voice. It is a strong voice...but frightening. I wonder what is on the inside of it.
2154,Rogue: Ugh... More church thugs. Can't anybody relax and a drink around here? Loosen up. How 'bout a game? You like cards?
2155,"Edelgard: If we only knew the enemy's true aim, we might have something to work with. Let's look around the monastery and see if we can learn any new information."
2156,"Edelgard: We've narrowed down some of the enemy's potential objectives, but we'll only know if we're right when the day is upon us."
2157,Dimitri: We need to know the enemy's motive so we can adapt. Let's talk to people around the monastery and see if we can learn anything that might lead us to a clue.
2158,Dimitri: We seem to have narrowed down some of the enemy's possible objectives. I wonder if our conjecture is correct... I suppose time will reveal all.
2159,"Claude: If I'm going to figure out what the enemy's after, I'll need more to go on. Keep an ear to the ground around the monastery for me. See what you can dig up."
2160,"Claude: I think we've narrowed down some of the enemy's possible objectives. We won't know until we know, of course, but I have a feeling a fight will be involved. Let's make sure we're prepared for that."
2161,Seteth: A band of thieves has been raiding villages in the north of Faerghus. Reports indicate they have made an old tower their stronghold. Do you have any idea where it might be?
2162,"Seteth: Conand Tower? Yes, I suppose that would make a sensible base for a group of thieves. I will use this information to investigate the matter further. You have my thanks."
2163,Ferdinand: I made a dreadful mistake and ended up with two of the same tea set. Now I must gift one of them to someone who can appreciate its value. Could you help me find someone deserving of such a precious gift?
2164,"Ferdinand: Thank you for your help, Professor! There is nothing quite like a tea party to brighten your spirits, don't you think? If you would like to get to know someone better, try inviting them to have tea with you."
2165,"Caspar: Do you know about the fighting tournaments here at the monastery? I hear anyone can get involved! Oh, I know! You and I should sign up, Professor!"
2166,"Caspar: You know how fighting tournaments work, right? One-on-one fights, one after another. Each month there are different tournaments. I can't wait!"
2167,"Anna: It seems there are some rare, valuable secrets circulating on the battlefield. I'd like you to collect a number of these for me, should you have an opportunity to do so."
2168,"Anna: Ah, you've collected some trade secrets for me! I really, really appreciate it! I'll just take them... Hehehe, perfect... What? Nothing! Just talking to myself. See you later!"
2169,Hubert: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. Are we going to move forward with our plan?
2170,"Edelgard: I believe so. How confident are you in our theory, Professor?"
2171,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're not wrong.
Linhardt: No one's intuition is perfect. It's ridiculous not to have doubts.
Choice 2: It could go either way.
Bernadetta: Oh, I don't like those odds at all...
Choice 3: I'm a little doubtful...
Petra: You have little doubts? That is good. We have no room for big doubts on this day."
2172,"Choice 1: We're not wrong.
Linhardt: No one's intuition is perfect. It's ridiculous not to have doubts."

2178,"Hubert: All that matters is how our enemy makes their move, not how our teacher feels about our plan."
2179,"Seteth: You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense."
2180,"Flayn: May I let you in on something, Professor? My brother can be a bit...callous. He told me that he was concerned about you, and hinted that perhaps you would be better off patrolling a coffin!"
2181,"Seteth: That was said in jest, Flayn. And in confidence. Please just remain by my side and do not cause any more trouble. As a professor, you would do well to remember that it is your duty to guide your students down the path of righteousness."
2182,"Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!"
2183,Hubert: A coffin. How fascinating.
2184,"Edelgard: Hurry, Professor. We must find a place to hide where we can guard the stairs to the Holy Mausoleum. If the enemy moves as predicted, we should be able to cut off their escape path and capture every last one of them."
2185,"Hubert: The Rite of Rebirth is about to begin, but we still don't know what our enemy is after."
2186,Edelgard: We have no choice but to deal with the situation as it unfolds.
2187,Ferdinand: That does not sound like you at all. I suppose you'll be needing my help on this one.
2188,"Caspar: It doesn't matter where they go, they won't get past me. I'll never let them near Lady Rhea!"
2189,"Edelgard: Ugh, Caspar, focus. Our mission is to find out what their true aim is."
2190,"Seteth: You seem a mite too relaxed for my liking. The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is about to begin. While we are in the Goddess Tower, we are relying on you to secure the locations that are lacking in defense."

2193,"Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!"
2194,Hubert: A coffin. How fascinating.
2195,"Edelgard: A coffin... Professor, I do know of one location that has potential. If you can't think of another option, follow me to the Holy Mausoleum beneath the monastery."
2196,Dimitri: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is finally here. Let's move ahead with our plan.
2197,"Dedue: Leave it to me. Professor, Are you in as well?"
2198,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course.
Ingrid: We've narrowed down our objective...kind of. So, let's show everyone that we can carry out our duties better than anyone!
Choice 2: I'm not sure about this.
Mercedes: Oh dear. Our professor seems to lack confidence in our plan. That is not very reassuring.
Choice 3: I'm hungry.
Annette: Umm... Oh! Well, I'll be sure to whip you up some tasty treats when this is all over!"

2209,"Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!"
2210,Dedue: It's time.
2211,"Dimitri: All right. Let's stick to the plan, and go hide where we can watch over the entrance to the Holy Mausoleum. If anyone suspicious enters, we'll follow them in and take them down. Got it?"
2212,Dimitri: The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is finally here. Yet we still don't know what the enemy is after... I suppose all we can do is try to cope with whatever should occur as we're patrolling the monastery.
2213,"Felix: Heh. Nothing like being a step behind, eh?"
2214,"Annette: Oh! I thought we might get hungry during our patrol, so I baked up some yummy treats for us. I may have messed them up though...just a bit."
2215,Dimitri: Annette... Don't tell me that explosion in the kitchen last night was–

2220,Dedue: It's time.
2221,"Dimitri: OK. I've narrowed the possibilities down to just a few locations that seemed especially suspect. Let's tackle them one by one. The second floor, the white tower, and deep underground, the Holy Mausoleum."
2222,Claude: The Rite of Rebirth is finally underway. Time to see if our hunch was right.
2223,"Hilda: Ugh, I hope it's not. Then we wouldn't have to fight anyone."
2224,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Our hunch is right.
Ignatz: We've all come to this conclusion together. I'm sure we got it right.
Choice 2: We are mistaken.
Lorenz: Do you really believe that, Professor? Claude certainly looks confident.
Choice 3: Only the goddess knows.
Marianne: Dear Goddess... Please protect us..."

2235,"Flayn: Please excuse us, everyone. We shall see you again after the ceremony has concluded!"
2236,Hilda: Seteth is way too overprotective. He reminds me of my brother.
2237,"Claude: Come on, Teach. I know a hidden spot where we can monitor the stairs that lead to the Holy Mausoleum. If there's anyone down there, they'll be trapped like the rats they are. We'll just have to take them down without getting bitten."
2238,Hilda: Oh! The Goddess's Rite of Rebirth is almost starting. But we didn't figure out what the enemy's real plan is...
2239,Claude: Worry not. I've got it all figured out.
2240,Hilda: Really? I guess I shouldn't be surprised. What did you come up with?
2241,"Claude: Last night, I imagined myself as the enemy and prowled around the monastery. That's when Master Thief Claude came across something very interesting..."

2246,Hilda: Seteth is way too overprotective. He reminds me of my brother.
2247,"Claude: Back to the subject at hand. What I found last night was a sealed coffin in the underground Holy Mausoleum. I did some research, and the only time you can easily get in and out of that place is during the Rite of Rebirth. And because of that alleged assassination plot, it has even thinner defenses than usual. It's all too clear."

2254,Mysterious Mage: Those Central Church dastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!
2255,Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.
2256,Edelgard: We were one step too late. Our unwanted guests are already here.
2257,Mysterious Mage: Those Central Church dastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!
2258,Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.
2259,Edelgard: Our enemy appears to be after the tomb of Saint Seiros in the back. Are they attempting to steal her bones? It would be best to defeat them before the achieve their aim.
2260,Defeat the enemy general within 25 turns and protect the casket.
2261,Edelgard: Look closely... There are contraptions of some sort on the floor. We must pay attention to our enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from advantageous positions.
2262,Mysterious Mage: Death Knight! Prove your strength and scatter these fools!
2263,Death Knight: I don't take commands. Or waste my time on weaklings.

2270,Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.
2271,Dimitri: The enemy is after the casket of Saint Seiros. Do they intend to steal her bones? We must defeat those enemies before they open the casket.
2272,Defeat the enemy general within 25 turns and protect the casket.
2273,Dimitri: But look closely at the ground... There are contraptions of some sort in place. We'll have to look closely at the enemies' weapons and advance while attacking them from the best positions possible.

2275,Death Knight: I don't take commands. Or waste my time on weaklings.
2276,Dimitri: That knight looks like he has experience. It would be foolish to challenge him recklessly.
2277,Claude: Our guess was spot on. Looks like we have company.
2278,Mysterious Mage: Those Central Church bastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!
2279,Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.
2280,Claude: We're late to our own party... Looks like the our company is already here.
2281,Mysterious Mage: Those Central Church dastards have spotted us... Buy me some time while I open the seal on the casket!
2282,Western Church Soldier: I'm on it.
2283,Claude: Looks like the enemy is going after the casket in the back. Maybe they're going after the saint's bones? Weird. I'd like to defeat them before they can finish the job.
2284,Defeat the enemy general within 25 turns and protect the casket.
2285,Claude: But did you notice? Look closely at the ground. There's some kind of contraption on certain parts of the floor. The smart move is to advance while finding the best fighting positions we can based on the enemy's weaponry.
2286,Mysterious Mage: Death Knight! Prove your strength and scatter these fools!
2287,Death Knight: I don't take commands. Or waste my time on weaklings.
2288,"Claude: I'm getting a really disturbing vibe from that guy... No one go near the evil-looking knight, OK?"
2289,"Mysterious Mage: The reinforcements haven't arrived?! If they approach from behind, we can attack them from both sides..."
2290,Mysterious Mage: It's no use! The seal is broken. You can't— Huh? A sword?
2291,The contents of the casket were stolen... You have been defeated. Use Divine Pulse to turn back time.
2292,Death Knight: Like moths to a flame...
2293,Edelgard: There's no way around it... I accept your challenge!
2294,Death Knight: Oh? This will be fun...
2295,"Mercedes: Oh my, how frightening! Won't you please go easy on me?"
2296,Death Knight: You... Was this meeting...preordained?
2297,Mercedes: Hmm? What do you mean?
2298,"Death Knight: I told you that if you fled, I would not chase you. But it seems you wish to die..."
2299,Death Knight: I didn't expect to encounter someone like you... How fortunate.
2300,Mysterious Mage: You're too late! The seal will be broken any minute now...
2301,Mysterious Mage: It's no use! The seal is broken. You can't– Huh? A sword?
2302,Death Knight: That sword is...I see. What a pleasant surprise. (Death Knight teleports away)
2303,"Edelgard: Ugh, he got away! That sword... Why is it –"
2304,"Hubert: That's the sword that was in the casket. Seems to be shimmering, almost as though..."
2305,Death Knight: That sword is...I see. What a pleasant surprise. (Death Knight teleports away)
2306,Dimitri: He got away... We have no choice but to let them go for now. Professor... The way that sword is glowing. I wonder...
2307,Death Knight: That sword is...I see. What a pleasant surprise. (Death Knight teleports away)
2308,"Claude: The jerk got away. Was that magic? We can't even chase after him. Hey, Professor. The way that sword is shining... Do you think it could be..."
2309,Catherine: Is the intruder here?! Oh... Looks like you have this under control. You! Round up any stragglers.
2310,Knight of Seiros: Will do!
2311,"Seteth: As all of you have committed a breach of faith, the archbishop will now pass judgement."
2312,"Shamir: Inciting a Kingdom noble to rebel. Unlawful entry. The attempted assassination of the archbishop. An attack on the Holy Mausoleum. It is unnecessary to go on, followers of the Western Church."
2313,Priest: What?! We have nothing to do with the Western Church!
2314,Seteth: You have already been identified. Please spare us your second-rate theater.
2315,"Rhea: Dishonoring a holy ceremony is worthy of death for a member of the church. You are well past the hope of redemption. If you have any grace remaining, you will willingly offer your life as atonement for this crime."
2316,Priest: No! This isn't what we were told would happen! We've been deceived!
2317,"Shamir: It's no use arguing. Whatever your excuse, the punishment stands."
2318,Rhea: May your souls find peace as they return to the goddess...
2319,Priest: Wait! Please! The goddess would never forgive you for our execution!
2320,Priest: Monster! We know you've already slaughtered many of our fellow brethren like this!
2321,"Rhea: This concludes the investigation. Please remove these poor, lost souls from my sight."
2322,"Edelgard: That's that, I suppose. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... It was all the Western Church's doing. That masked knight who led the attack somehow managed to disappear without a trace."
2323,Hubert: The Church of Seiros clearly isn't as unified as it would hope to appear. It seems the bishop of the Western Church was always opposed to the church being ruled centrally from Garreg Mach. Perhaps they hope to remove the archbishop in order to completely strip the Central Church of its authority.
2324,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Western Church...
Choice 2: The Central Church?"
2325,Choice 1: The Western Church...
2326,Choice 2: The Central Church?
2327,"Edelgard: Ugh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you were raised without any exposure to the church. In order to function more efficiently, the Church of Seiros is split into several smaller entities. The Central Church is the largest and leads the organization from Garreg Mach."
2328,"Hubert: The Western Church extends from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato rebelled into the far west. They can be found just beyond the most renowned stronghold of the Kingdom, the Fortress City of Arianrhod."
2329,Edelgard: It seems the knights have been tasked with subduing the leaders of the Western Church. We may be give an opportunity to help them with their mission.
2330,"Hubert: To think...our own professor was born in Fódlan and yet knew nothing of the church. I never imagined explaining something so basic to an instructor of mine. You're something of a special case, are you not?"
2331,Edelgard: How strange that the archbishop would ask someone like that to lead her students. There's clearly more to that decision than we know.
2332,"Caspar: Lady Rhea is pretty scary sometimes...but to execute that whole group just like that? It seems harsh, even for her."
2333,"Bernadetta: If one of us does something bad, I wonder what she would do to us!"
2334,Dorothea: Professor... Do you agree with the archbishop's actions?
2335,"Seteth: There you are, Professor. It seems Lady Rhea would like a word with you. Come with me."
2336,Dimitri: There you have it... It seems that the assassination attempt and the attack on the Holy Mausoleum were all the work of the Western Church. As for the masked knight who led the attack... I'm afraid his whereabouts are yet unknown.
2337,Dedue: It makes no sense that the Western Church would try such a thing.
2338,"Dimitri: It just goes to show that the Church of Seiros is not completely united. The church is led by those here in Garreg Mach, and the Western Church doesn't have a strong voice on its governing council. I imagine the Western Church has harbored some resentment towards the Central Church for a while now."
2339,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Western Church...
Choice 2: The Central Church?"
2340,Choice 1: The Western Church...
2341,Choice 2: The Central Church?
2342,"Dimitri: Ah, that's right. Jeralt did say that you grew up outside the influence of the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few branches across Fódlan. The largest being the Central Church, which is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach."
2343,"Dimitri: The Western Church lies far to the west of Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato held his rebellion. It's situated on the far side of the Kingdom's most impressive fortress, Arianrhod. I imagine the Western Church's intention was to eliminate Lady Rhea, and the Central Church's authority along with her. Naturally, the knights will be riding out to question the Western Church's top officials. Or rather...to punish them."
2344,"Dedue: When they do, Your Highness, we will likely be asked to carry out said punishment."
2345,"Dimitri: Indeed. Now, I don't mean to be rude, Professor, but I must say that your situation is rather unusual. For someone to grow up in Fódlan and yet never have any contact with the Church of Seiros is...it's hard to believe."
2346,Dedue: I wonder why the archbishop would hire someone like that as a professor...
2347,"Ashe: So...those people from the Western Church were... Um, Lady Rhea had them killed, didn't she?"
2348,"Mercedes: Well, of course she did. Going against the teachings of Seiros like that. Quite unforgivable!"
2349,"Ingrid: Those who stray must be punished, I suppose. That said... Professor, I–"
2350,"Seteth: There you are, Professor. It seems Lady Rhea would like a word with you. Come with me."
2351,"Claude: I suppose that's that. The assassination attempt, the attack on the Holy Mausoleum... Looks like it was all a plot by the Western Church. It's just too bad that that masked knight who was leading the attack got away. Vanished without a trace."
2352,Hilda: But why would the Western Church want to attack Lady Rhea?
2353,Claude: Why? Take your pick of reasons. Relations with the Western Church aren't exactly friendly.
2354,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Western Church...
Choice 2: What reasons?"
2355,Choice 1: The Western Church...
2356,Choice 2: What reasons?
2357,"Claude: Oh, that's right. Jeralt mentioned that you grew up completely isolated from the church. The Church of Seiros is split into a few different branches across Fódlan. The Central Church is headquartered right here at Garreg Mach."
2358,"Claude: Then there's the Western Church. Far west from Castle Gaspard, where Lord Lonato had his little rebellion, is the Fortress City of Arianrhod. It's the strongest fortress in the Kingdom. On the other side of it is the headquarters of the Western Church."
2359,Hilda: Not too smart to bicker with people who worship the same goddess as you.
2360,"Claude: The bishop of the Western Church must be pretty ambitious. Probably hopes to split off completely. In which case, he'd need to weaken the Central Church's influence. Killing Rhea is certainly one way to do that. To the shock of no one, I hear the knights have been sent to subdue the leaders of the Western Church. We'll probably get a chance to assist."
2361,"Hilda: You're an odd one, aren't you, Professor? How'd you make it this far in life without ever interacting with the church? I can't believe someone like you exists in Fódlan. It's too strange!"
2362,"Claude: If you think that's weird, consider the fact that Rhea hired Teach despite all that."
2363,"Raphael: So, those guys they caught... They all got the axe, right? That's brutal."
2364,Lysithea: Lady Rhea can be rather intimidating at times. In fact...she can be downright terrifying.
2365,Marianne: Professor. Those who cannot be saved must be delivered to the goddess for judgement. Is that not so?
2366,"Seteth: There you are, Professor. It seems Lady Rhea would like a word with you. Come with me."
2367,Arundel: The archbishop lives. Not that I had ever placed much faith in those swine from the Western Church.
2368,"Flame Emperor: I have news, both good and bad. The remains of Seiros were not in the tomb. However, something else was. The Sword of the Creator."
2369,"Arundel: Ah, the weapon wielded by that thief, the King of Liberation."
2370,"Flame Emperor: Thief? Hm. At any rate, it is now in the hands of the academy's new professor. I doubt you will be surprised to hear that the Crest Stone had already been removed from the sword when it was found."
2371,Arundel: Hmph. As expected. It would be foolish to keep both in the same location.
2372,"Flame Emperor: There's more. The professor was able to awaken the sword's true power. Even without the Crest Stone, the sword glowed red. The professor's Crest is compatible. There is no mistaking it."
2373,Arundel: Absurd. Using a Relic without its Crest Stone should be impossible... The King of Liberation's bloodline should not even... Hmm.
2374,"Flame Emperor: They must be allowed to keep it, for now. I do not have enough information about the professor to act. As for your request, I assent. The Death Knight is at your command. Use him well."
2375,Arundel: Good. I believe I will enjoy this a great deal...
2376,"Rhea: I cannot thank you enough for defeating those invaders in the Holy Mausoleum, and especially for protecting the Sword of the Creator. That sword is one of the Heroes' Relics, and the most precious artifact in the church's possession. It is also a weapon of terrifying power. For now...I will entrust the sword to you. Please, use it wisely."
2377,"Seteth: Lady Rhea, wait! Do you truly mean to give the Sword of the Creator to this stranger?! Surely it is not the sort of thing that one hands over so readily, even to someone who has the ability to wield it! If someone like Nemesis were to appear again, all of Fódlan would be consumed by war!"
2378,Byleth: Nemesis?
2379,"Seteth: Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He is an ancient king of mankind who was defeated by Seiros over a thousand years ago. When Fódlan was attacked by wicked gods, it is said that the goddess gifted Nemesis with the Sword of the Creator. Nemesis used that sword to defeat the wicked gods, saving all of Fódlan. Henceforth he was dubbed the King of Liberation. However, his power began to corrupt him until he, himself, turned to the darkness. Saint Seiros was forced to destroy him. Lady Rhea, I beg you to reconsider. Given a little more time, we could more accurately assess this stranger's abilities."
2380,"Rhea: No. I have faith, Seteth. Faith that our friend here will not be corrupted by wickedness. Since the death of Nemesis, none have been able to wield the Sword of the Creator. Now, after all those long years of being sealed away, it has returned and found a new master."
2381,"Seteth: I...understand. As you wish, Lady Rhea. There you have it, Professor. See that you do not betray the trust the archbishop has seen fit to bestow upon you."
2382,Sothis: The Sword of the Creator. The King of Liberation. Each tale is more confusing than the last! And I really can't read that Rhea at all... That sword is clearly precious... So why is she so keen to gift the thing to you?
2383,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It certainly is strange. (continued below)
Choice 2: The sword chose me.
Sothis: Is that a fact?"
2384,Choice 1: It certainly is strange. (continued below)
2385,"Choice 2: The sword chose me.
Sothis: Is that a fact?"
2386,Sothis: Is that a fact?
2387,"Sothis: I feel as though we have become entangled in a mystery... And there is one more thing that has been plaguing me. The Sword of the Creator... It somehow feels distinct from other Relics we have seen. Such as the one that... Oh goodness, what was her name? Ca... Cat..."
2388,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Catherine?
Sothis: Yes! Her!
Choice 2: Cat?
Sothis: What is wrong with that head of yours? Of course it's not a cat! Her name is Catherine."
2389,"Choice 1: Catherine?
Sothis: Yes! Her!"
2390,Sothis: Yes! Her!
2391,"Choice 2: Cat?
Sothis: What is wrong with that head of yours? Of course it's not a cat! Her name is Catherine."
2392,Sothis: What is wrong with that head of yours? Of course it's not a cat! Her name is Catherine.
2393,"Sothis: The Sword of the Creator differs from her Thunderbrand in one key way. It bears a hole...where something should have been, but is no more. I despise not knowing what is going on! It...it frightens me. And yet... I place my trust in you. I must. Whatever comes to pass...please swear to cut a path that is your own."
2394,"Claude: The Sword of the Creator… Pulled right from the legends. I finally found it, and yet it ended up in Teach's hands. Could I even use it anyway? Damn it. There's no telling what's to come…"
2395,"The ceaseless rains that satiate the verdant landscape of Fódlan are accompanied the fierce winds and mighty roars of thunder. This abundance of rain, sparkling as it falls against beams of emerging sunlight, is a constant reminder to the people of Fódlan that nature is ever wild and unpredictable. For when the rain finally does pause, the clouds part to give way to a glorious rainbow.

"
2478,"Rhea: I have a new mission for you, Professor. I would like for you to take your students into Kingdom territory to eliminate some thieves."
2479,Seteth: They stole a Hero's Relic from House Gautier of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus–the Lance of Ruin. Their leader's name is Miklan. He is apparently a disowned son of House Gautier.
2480,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why was he disowned?
Seteth: I believe it had something to do with his lack of a Crest. Such happenings are fairly common within the Kingdom.
Rhea: The Crestless cannot harness the goddess's power, even if they possess a Relic. Nonetheless, they are still capable of simply wielding those weapons.
Choice 2: Why must the church eliminate him?
Seteth: This skirmish involves a holy Relic, and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving."
2481,"Choice 1: Why was he disowned?
Seteth: I believe it had something to do with his lack of a Crest. Such happenings are fairly common within the Kingdom.

Seteth: This skirmish involves a holy Relic, and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving."
2485,"Seteth: This skirmish involves a holy Relic, and is therefore more than a single noble is capable of resolving."
2486,"Seteth: The Heroes' Relics are immensely powerful weapons. We must meet this threat with adequate force. Unfortunately, most of the Knights of Seiros are away from the monastery purging the apostates of the Western Church. So we are entrusting you with this mission. After all, you wield the Sword of the Creator, which is more than capable of opposing any Relic."
2487,"Rhea: The Sword of the Creator is a powerful weapon, well beyond the other Relics. You have nothing to fear. However, to ensure that no harm comes to the students, we will also send the monastery's most skilled individuals to aid you."
2488,"Seteth: I must remind you that you are expected to conduct yourself in a manner befitting the wielder of that holy sword. Also, you should know that Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. That is all."
2489,"Edelgard: Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. A thief with a Hero's Relic is worrisome, but with you at our side, I'm certain we can handle him. After all, you have the Sword of the Creator. It was allegedly wielded by Nemesis, the King of Liberation. If the legends are true, you hold the power to stand against entire armies. A band of thieves should be nothing. Even the most elite Imperial forces or the Knights of Seiros could not hope to defeat you."
2490,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why does it matter?
Edelgard: I'm just marveling at the potential. Besides, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator.
Choice 2: It would never come to that.
Edelgard: Is that so? Even if those forces were to hurt someone precious to you? Can you say with full confidence that you would not turn your sword on them if that were to happen? You know, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator."
2491,"Choice 1: Why does it matter?
Edelgard: I'm just marveling at the potential. Besides, your power does not lie solely in the Sword of the Creator."

2495,"Edelgard: You are stronger and more terrifying than you realize. Professor... When we leave the monastery, will you still think of yourself as my teacher?"
2496,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Choice 2: If we left the monastery?"
2497,Choice 1: What do you mean?
2498,Choice 2: If we left the monastery?
2499,"Edelgard: Never mind. I'm being thoughtless with my words. For now, let's just focus on the problem at hand."
2500,"Dimitri: I heard about our mission for this month. So... We are to eradicate thieves in Kingdom territory. I'm sorry for dragging into the Kingdom's petty squabbles. This should not be your burden to bear, but my own..."
2501,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm happy to help. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Choice 2: It's just a job."
2502,Choice 1: I'm happy to help. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
2503,Choice 2: It's just a job.
2504,"Dimitri: Thank you, Professor. Hearing you say that puts my mind at ease."
2505,Dimitri: Hm?
2506,"Rodrigue: Your Highness? Ah, it's been ages!"
2507,"Dimitri: It's been a long time! Two years, if I'm not mistaken."
2508,"Rodrigue: Indeed, Your Highness. You've grown so much in those years. I hardly recognize you."
2509,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who's this?
Choice 2: A friend of yours?"
2510,Choice 1: Who's this?
2511,Choice 2: A friend of yours?
2512,"Dimitri: This is Rodrigue, an old friend of my father's. I believe I've mentioned him, if you recall. When my father died four years ago, he looked after me as though I were his own son."
2513,"Rodrigue: (laughs) You flatter me, Your Highness. It was my honor to care for such a fine, young man. It's nice to finally meet you, Professor. My son, Felix, has mentioned you on occasion."
2514,"Dimitri: What brings you to the monastery, Rodrigue? Is it the thieves plaguing the Kingdom?"
2515,"Rodrigue: I'm afraid so. This is not merely a problem for House Gautier, but for everyone. The thieves have set up their headquarters in Fraldarius territory, and are mercilessly pillaging the villages of that area. You have our full support in stopping those dastards. I thank you for your help, both of you."
2516,"Claude: Hey, Teach. I gotta say, I never would've guessed you were a descendant of the King of Liberation. You didn't forget, did you? That story I told you about a Relic that could cut a mountain in half? That Relic was the Sword of the Creator! The very same used by Nemesis, the King of Liberation."
2517,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What are you talking about?
Choice 2: I'm not his descendant."
2518,Choice 1: What are you talking about?
2519,Choice 2: I'm not his descendant.
2520,"Claude: Don't be coy, Teach. The Sword of the Creator could only be wielded by Nemesis. If you can use it too, that can only mean you have that bloodline's Crest."
2521,Byleth: I don't understand.
2522,"Claude: Fine, keep your secrets. But just so you know, ""I don't understand"" isn't gonna cut it here at the monastery. Speaking of, Professor Hanneman has been looking for you. He probably wants to examine your Crest with those crazy instruments of his. Actually...sounds amusing. Maybe I'll tag along."
2523,Judith: If it isn't my little Claude! What has you so worked up?
2524,Claude: Judith?! What are you doing here?
2525,"Judith: That's Lady Judith to you, boy. I told you, until you're in charge, I expect you to address me with all due respect. Anyway, I'm here to retrieve you. Duke Riegan's condition has taken a turn for the worse."
2526,Claude: Are you saying the old man's on his death bed?
2527,"Judith: No, it's not that bad. But in the state he's in, he won't be able to participate in the next roundtable conference. He wants you to go in his stead. I volunteered to play the messenger."
2528,"Claude: Well, thanks for that. Oh, and Teach, this is Judith. Also known as the Hero of House Daphnel."
2529,"Judith: So you're little Claude's teacher, are you? How much trouble has he been giving you?"
2530,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Plenty.
Choice 2: Not too much."
2531,Choice 1: Plenty.
2532,Choice 2: Not too much.
2533,"Claude: If her nickname didn't give it away, you should know that Judith...er, Lady Judith is the leader of the famous House Daphnel of the Leicester Alliance. She used to be a big deal at the roundtable conferences, but it seems of late she's been reduced to a mere–"
2534,"Judith: You had better shut that mouth before I put my boot in it, you tactless nuisance! Now come on. Let's get going. Sorry, Professor, but I need to borrow the boy for a bit."
2535,"Claude: I suppose we'll have to finish our chat later. Sorry, Teach. But don't you worry. I'll be back in time for our next mission. All right, Judith. Let's get going."
2536,"Judith: It's Lady... Ah, I suppose you are the active leader for the time being. Fair enough, boy. Fair enough."
2537,"Hanneman: Good of you to come, Professor. I've heard much about you lately. Specifically, that you were able to awaken the Sword of the Creator's power. Thusly, it seems the true nature of your Crest has been uncovered. I had, of course, seen your Crest before. However, at first, I failed to recognize its true nature. Eventually, it dawned on me that what is visible is perhaps merely a small part of a greater whole. In other words, your Crest is too significant to be detected when using normal instruments. After this discovery, I began researching Crests that might fit that description, which allowed for a temporary hypothesis. However, I could not be certain. The Crest my conclusions led me to was far too unusual. A Crest thought to have disappeared in this world in the millennium since the fall of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. The Crest of Flames. That is what you possess."
2538,Byleth: The Crest of Flames...
2539,"Hanneman: Your ability to wield the Sword of the Creator has unequivocally proven my hypothesis. A legendary power, dormant since time immemorial, and now resurrected... There can be no doubt that this ancient power resides within you."
2540,"Sothis: A stone? A stone... I do not understand. Yet as I think of it, the pounding in my chest grows faster still. But is that me...or is it you? Hmm..."
2541,Edelgard: For a Hero's Relic to be stolen... It's unheard of.
2542,"Hubert: And just last month, the Sword of the Creator was almost stolen too."
2543,Edelgard: Also quite unheard of. What imprudence.
2544,"Hubert: For House Gautier to invite us on to their land, they must be desperate. But at least we'll have the stalwart knights ready to stand around and watch us do all the work."
2545,"Dimitri: Say, I hear that a Knight of Seiros named Gilbert will be joining us for our mission this moon. He is skilled, which is surely a boon for us. Still... That was not very thoughtful of Lady Rhea."
2546,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you know him?
Dimitri: Ahh, well... No, I do not. Not really. All I will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past.
Choice 2: Do you have history with him?
Dimitri: No... It's nothing. In any case, you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart."
2547,"Choice 1: Do you know him?
Dimitri: Ahh, well... No, I do not. Not really. All I will say is that we have trained together a few times in the past."

Dimitri: No... It's nothing. In any case, you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart."
2550,"Dimitri: No... It's nothing. In any case, you should at least introduce yourself to him before we depart."
2551,Dimitri: House Gautier is Sylvain's home. It would be nice if you could check on him as well.
2552,Dimitri: I am sorry that the Kingdom's unrest did not stop with Lord Lonato... Professor... The Heroes' Relics are incredibly powerful. Please be on your guard.
2553,"Claude: Oof. This wasn't the first time I've taken part in an Alliance roundtable conference, but it was still exhausting. There's not enough cooperation in that group, especially from Lorenz's father. But at least my grandfather was surprisingly alert. Judging by that, I'd say he's got at least five more years in him."
2554,"Claude: Hey, Teach. I hear you were able to use the Sword of the Creator. That means... What does that mean? Could it mean that you're a descendant of Nemesis, the King of Liberation?!"
2555,Edelgard: For a Hero's Relic to be stolen... It's unheard of.
2556,"Hubert: And just last month, the Sword of the Creator was almost stolen too."
2557,Edelgard: Also quite unheard of. What imprudence.

2559,"Ferdinand: The coffin of Seiros in the Holy Mausoleum should have held her remains. Instead, they say, it held the Sword of the Creator. What could it mean?"
2560,Linhardt: Swinging a sword about in the Holy Mausoleum? The potential for damage is too great to imagine. I sincerely hope the saints' coffins were not damaged.
2561,"Byleth:
Choice 1: They didn't. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Choice 2: One might've been scratched."
2562,Choice 1: They didn't. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
2563,Choice 2: One might've been scratched.
2564,"Linhardt: Were you using magic? I've heard you weren't, but– Ugh! It's torture not being able to go inside the Holy Mausoleum for an entire year."
2565,"Linhardt: You and your class were at that fight in the Holy Mausoleum, right? I sincerely hope the holy artifacts are unscathed. I admit I wish I could've been there to see it all, even if it does make me queasy. But I was there too early. I'd gone first thing in the morning. At noon, one of the monks chased me out saying I'd been there too long. Who were they to decide when I've been somewhere too long?"
2566,"Caspar: I heard a relic was stolen. If this had something to do with a family conflict, I don't think I could choose a side."
2567,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even if there's a clear guilty party?
Choice 2: We can't allow a Hero's Relic to be stolen. (Relationship with Caspar Up)"
2568,Choice 1: Even if there's a clear guilty party?
2569,Choice 2: We can't allow a Hero's Relic to be stolen. (Relationship with Caspar Up)
2570,"Caspar:
Choice 1: I think I'd be a pretty good judge of that!
Choice 2: What if it's some kind of powerful weapon? I want one too!"
2571,Choice 1: I think I'd be a pretty good judge of that!
2572,Choice 2: What if it's some kind of powerful weapon? I want one too!
2573,"Caspar:
I know Relics aren't easy to come by, but I'd still like to get my hands on one..."
2574,"I know Relics aren't easy to come by, but I'd still like to get my hands on one..."
2575,Caspar: I'm gonna keep training until I can beat you!
2576,Bernadetta: (surprised) I'm not secretly eating cake!
2577,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can sense it.
Bernadetta: Hmm... OK, what's Bernie doing right now? Oh, fine. You got me. But keep it a secret, all right?
Choice 2: I'll take your word for it. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: You're getting pretty good at talking through the door, Professor!"

2581,"Bernadetta: You're getting pretty good at talking through the door, Professor!"
2582,"Dorothea: So, you have a Crest too, eh, Professor? Does that mean you're descended from nobility? You've certainly got the look for it... I sure do wish there were more nobles like you, Professor. A teacher, a mercenary, and so very mysterious... How could a girl ever get enough?"
2583,"Petra: I have never had goings to the Kingdom's north. I hear the people of north are cold and have much loneliness. Professor, I hear you have had work...have worked as a mercenary in the Kingdom. Did you find joy in this? You cannot remember? Is that having possibility? I have amazement..."
2584,Dedue: I know Lord Rodrigue. He paid repeated visits to His Highness after the previous king was killed.
2585,"Dedue: The Western Church. The Central Church. They believe in the same goddess, but oppose one another. Fódlan is a complicated place."
2586,Felix: Have you seen a man who looks like me? He's middle-aged and relatively tall.
2587,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have. (Relationship with Felix up)
Choice 2: I have not."
2588,Choice 1: I have. (Relationship with Felix up)
2589,Choice 2: I have not.
2590,"Felix: If you get the chance, tell him I've gone out. OK?"
2591,"Felix: Think of it! The Sword of the Creator, belonging to the ancient King Nemesis. You have to master it as soon as you can. I can't wait to face off against such a legendary weapon!"
2592,Ashe: So the whole plan to attack the monastery was some plot devised by the Western Church? That means they used Lonato. What right do they have to drag a good man like that into their schemes?!
2593,(Continued from above)
2594,Ashe: There's going to be a big investigation into the Western Church soon. I wish I could be a part of it. I want to hear for myself why Lonato had to die.
2595,"Sylvain: I'm so sorry my older brother is causing you all this hassle, Professor. Don't misunderstand, I always thought he was a piece of garbage, but I never thought he'd steal the Relic. I can't wait to see his face when he realizes I'm in the group that was sent to take him down."
2596,"Sylvain: I can't believe my own brother is the leader of the bandits. House Gautier is my true home…and his. Please, Professor. He really is one of the worst people I've ever known, but we still… We share the same blood. We're still family."
2597,"Mercedes: Isn't it strange? Saint Seiros's body was missing from her coffin, but they found a sword in its place... Do you think she moved from her coffin and left the sword behind?"
2598,"Mercedes: Professor! You looked like a natural wielding the Sword of the Creator! It's strange though, isn't it? The last owner of the sword was Nemesis, but I thought he didn't have any descendants…"
2599,"Annette: Hey, Professor? Did you happen to see that man I was looking for earlier? I just spotted him by the dining hall, but then he ran away!"
2600,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who is he to you?
Annette: He... To be honest, he's my father. He's using a different name now, but there's no mistaking it. It's him. I know it is!

2604,"Annette: Oh? You saw him by the entrance to the monastery? Thank you, Professor!"
2605,Annette: Father... I've found you at last!
2606,"Annette: Professor! If you're heading to the Kingdom, I would recommend taking a coat. It's chilly, even at this time of year. It also rains a fair bit. Don't get caught out there without protection, or you're sure to catch a cold!"
2607,"Ingrid: Wow, Lord Rodrigue in the flesh... What is Felix doing? This is such a rare opportunity for him to see his family..."
2608,"Ingrid: Professor, please leave Sylvain alone for the time being. The thing is, the bandits' leader who stole the Relic...is Sylvain's disinherited older brother."
2609,"Lorenz: I have heard that someone from House Gautier, one of the Kingdom of Faerghus's noble families, is causing some sort of commotion. What a complete disgrace to the nobility."
2610,"Raphael: Hey, Professor. Don't you think everyone's making too big a fuss over these Crests or Heroes' Relics or whatever they're called? How important can that stuff really be?"
2611,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's very important.
Choice 2: I'm not sure. (Relationship with Raphael up)"
2612,Choice 1: It's very important.
2613,Choice 2: I'm not sure. (Relationship with Raphael up)
2614,"Raphael: Personally, I don't even care that I don't have a Crest. I'll take muscles over Crests any day. Heck, I'll take muscles over a hot meal! Actually..."
2615,Ignatz: Don't you think Professor Hanneman's been acting a bit...strange? Maybe he's made some kind of big discovery.
2616,"Lysithea: Is it true that Lady Rhea entrusted the Sword of the Creator to you? I can hardly even fathom you being capable of wielding something of such power. Just who are you, anyway?"
2617,Lysithea: Aristocrats are fools–-allowing their lives to be dictated by their Crests. Though...I suppose I am much the same in that regard...
2618,Marianne: Some people are unhappy because they don't have the Crest they want... And some are unhappy because they have a Crest they never asked for.
2619,"Hilda: I thought school life would be peaceful and quiet, with a sprinkle of drama to keep things interesting. But since you arrived, it's been one thing after another. Is that just a coincidence, I wonder?"
2620,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I believe so. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Oh, I was just kidding! Anyway, as I said before, I do like having a little drama in my life.
Choice 2: Maybe. Maybe not.

2626,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: OK. I doubt there's anything I can do for him, but I figured I'd ask anyway.
Choice 2: Why don't you ask him yourself?
Leonie: I did, but he just dodged the question. Still, it's worrying to see him like that."

2631,"Rhea: You must be rather bewildered by the power that was hidden within. However, know that I believe in you. I have no doubt that you will use that power justly. You will most certainly fulfill the grand destiny that the goddess has seen fit to grant you."
2632,"Seteth: Ah, Professor. Jeralt was looking for you."
2633,Byleth: Where is he?
2634,"Seteth: It seems he has gone off somewhere. If he is not in his room, then surely someone has seen him. Ask around."
2635,Seteth: How are you managing the Sword of the Creator? No problems? I hope you have not left it lying somewhere unattended or anything foolish like that.
2636,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No problems. (Relationship with Seteth up)

2640,"Flayn: Why is that fish so...still? Wait-–is it swimming sideways?! Perhaps... Perhaps it is resigned to its woeful fate of being plucked from the water and eaten... Ah, Professor. You are so outgoing with all of the students. I would like to have more opportunities to connect with you, though I am certain my brother would disapprove."
2641,"Catherine: You acquitted yourself honorably last month. To think they'd go into the Holy Mausoleum and assault the Goddess Tower... I cannot imagine the Western Church is acting on its own. Someone must have been helping them. As for the masked knight who escaped, his days are numbered. I hope we find him soon, so I can kill him myself."
2642,"Gilbert: Hail, Professor. If I may introduce myself, I am Gilbert. My life has been spent as a dedicated knight. I am to accompany you on your assignment. I may have slowed a step in recent years, but I pledge to you the full extent of my abilities."

Let me tell you, I put all of my knowledge to use keeping those kids alive. Still, the truth of it is that when someone faces death for the first time...well, they figure out who they are. They learn if they can do it again. We can't lose them, Professor. Not to battle, or to cowardice. If you can keep them going, then I will too."
2655,"Byleth:

2656,Choice 1: I will protect them. (Relationship with Manuela up)
2657,Choice 2: I will try my best.
2658,"Tomas: The head of the Western Church holds the title of bishop. That's not as distinguished as an archbishop such as Lady Rhea, but it still comes with a fair amount of authority. If someone in that position plotted an assassin, I cannot help but think it must have been instigated by some outside force. There are bishops in the Eastern Church as well, but to speak frankly, they do not have much impact. They are under the influence of both the archbishop and the Leicester Alliance, so their ability to voice grievances is quite limited."
2659,"Cyril: I hear about the things you did. I'm so glad Lady Rhea's safe. I figure you're a great person after all, Professor."
2660,"Constance: The next mission is to rout bandits in the Kingdom, is it not? I find the idea unsettling. Though the bandits have captured a large prize, they are insignificant in and of themselves. The matter would be more appropriately dealt with by Margrave Gauthier or the Faerghus royal family. I grant that I am most likely jumping at shadows... But I fear that if Faerghus is weakened, the tipped scales will lead to widespread unrest."
2661,"Anna: I've been hearing a lot about you lately. Word on the street is you wield some amazing sword. If you ever want to sell it to me, I'd pay top G! Just kidding. Sorta. It's, uh, not for sale, is it?"
2662,"Rodrigue: Professor. Have you seen my son, perchance? I have need of him."

2667,"Rodrigue: Is that so? Thank you, Professor."
2668,"Rodrigue: I must ask him not to distract you, Professor, nor His Highness from the matter at hand."
2669,"Rodrigue: I am Rodrigue Achille Fraldarius. I bear the great honor of serving as a lord in the Kingdom of Faerghus. I have come in Margrave Gautier's stead to retrieve their stolen Relic. However... As I hear it, a group of students is to attend to this matter. I sincerely hope no harm comes to any of them."
2670,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh! Come to think of it, last month there was something to report, wasn't there? Thanks to you, I hear that everything was resolved. I never realized that bandits had entered... I'm not a great guard after all, am I? I hope you will forgive me one day."
2671,"Knight of Seiros: That man I walked past earlier... That wasn't Lord Rodrigue, was it? House Fraldarius is a powerful noble family, linked to the founding of Faerghus. Lord Rodrigue, its current leader, is a magnificent warrior. He's known as the Shield of Faerghus. A dozen or so years ago, during the northern campaign in Sreng, he performed splendidly as the king's right hand. Come to think of it, wasn't there someone from House Fraldarius amongst this year's students?"
2672,"Student: The Leicester Alliance is governed through roundtable conferences between the five most prominent allied dukes–the Five Great Lords. First and foremost is Duke Riegan, the Alliance's leader. Joining him are the heads of House Goneril, House Gloucester, and House Ordelia. Lastly, there is the newest addition, Margrave Edmund. These five each have voting power in the conferences. Before House Edmund, it was House Daphnel that was counted amongst the five. However... It is said that the head of that family relinquished their vote to House Edmund, which had only recently risen to significance."
2673,"Student: I've had a chance to spar with Gilbert of the Knights of Seiros before. I couldn't get a single strike in! If that man is accompanying you on your assignment, you can rest assured that no harm will come to you. To be honest, he kind of reminds me of someone... But no, it must be my imagination. Right?"
2674,"Knight of Seiros: You guys have it bad in your own way, but believe me when I say we've got it bad too. With all that happened last month, a great many knights were dispatched to the Western Church. And now we must set out for the Eastern Church, located in the far east of the Leicester Alliance. If I must die in Alliance territory, I wish it wasn't in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. I'd much rather go on a sightseeing trip to Derdriu. Oh, you don't know? Derdriu is House Riegan's territory. It's called the Aquatic capital."
2675,"Monk: The assassination attempt on Lady Rhea, the theft of a Hero's Relic... I am up to my ears in foul news of recent! Speaking of, there's a terrifying rumor swirling around Garreg Mach these days. Apparently a spirit of death wielding a huge scythe has been kidnapping young maidens. Will the madness never end?!"
2676,"Yuri: Miklan? I know that guy. In northern Faerghus, he's pretty well-known...and not in a good way. The guy does what he pleases, attacking towns in Margrave Gautier's territory relentlessly. Stealing food and even abducting women. I may be the leader of a bunch of thugs, too, but I'm nothing like that slime bag."
2677,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You worry people might compare you? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Eh, a bit. I've got folks who follow my lead. But the similarities end there.

2682,"Yuri: A Hero's Relic can turn a slime bag like Miklan into a knight. I know you've got one of those shinies yourself, but don't go doing anything reckless."
2683,"Balthus: You're a busy one, aren't ya? Always on the road. Being a professor seems like a tough gig. Back when I was first enrolled here, we rarely traveled. The Battle of the Eagle and Lion was about it. This really stirs up the old memories. When I took part, my house lost. May have been my fault. It's hard to believe, but I was pretty rash back then. Hey... Think I can join in again this year? Bet you could pull some strings and make it happen, yeah?"
2684,"Hapi: Nice sword, Chatterbox. I like how it lights up. That's a neat trick. But, now that you have it, the church is gonna want to use your power for their own ends. Are you gonna let that happen?"

Choice 2: No.
Hapi: Good. Glad to hear it. (Relationship with Hapi up)"
2686,"Choice 1: I'm not sure.
Hapi: Oh, come on. You can't be so passive."
2687,"Hapi: Oh, come on. You can't be so passive."
2688,"Choice 2: No.
Hapi: Good. Glad to hear it. (Relationship with Hapi up)"
2689,Hapi: Good. Glad to hear it. (Relationship with Hapi up)
2690,Hapi: You gotta think for yourself. You're too good to become one of their stooges.
2691,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Actually, if I recall correctly─which is my job and passion─there were reportable happenings up top as well. That's why I'm still stuck with Mr. Backup."
2692,Knight of Seiros: I'm still here by request of Lord Seteth. You can never be too vigilant.
2693,"Abysskeeper: Truth be told, I'm used to the guy by now. Not Yuri, though. He shoots him a pointed glare every time he walks by. Heh. How Yuri is that?"
2694,Resident: Aelfric used to use his position in the church to look out for Abyss. He basically set this whole place up for us. Then some scandal or other forced him out. Got to wonder what got the church so riled up...
2695,"Rogue: The best fighter in the Abyss? Balthus, probably. Yuri's definitely the most cunning. Constance is the strongest with magic. The most dangerous of them all though? Hapi. You've heard the rumors, haven't you?"
2696,"Seteth: Jeralt is looking for you. I last saw him near his quarters, but if he is not there, simply ask around."
2697,"Leonie: Oh, Professor! Are you looking for Captain Jeralt? I just saw him in the knights' hall a little while ago. He was talking with a female knight, but I didn't get a good look at who she was."
2698,"Catherine: Oh, Jeralt? He said something about visiting a grave. There's a graveyard attached to the monastery, so you'll probably find him there. I can't remember where the graveyard is, but I bet Seteth knows."
2699,"Seteth: You're back. Ah, the graveyard? Of course I know it. It can be a little hard to find. Would you like me to show you where it is?"
2700,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Please.
Seteth: Very well.
Choice 2: Another time.
Seteth: You need only ask. I will be here."
2701,"Choice 1: Please.
Seteth: Very well."
2702,Seteth: Very well.
2703,"Choice 2: Another time.
Seteth: You need only ask. I will be here."
2704,Seteth: You need only ask. I will be here.
2705,You have discerned Jeralt's whereabouts. You can now view this location on the map.
2706,"Jeralt: Hey. I wanted to ask you to join me, but I couldn't find you. So here I am. I was thinking we should visit...your mother. She's resting beneath this humble grave..."
2707,Byleth: Why is her grave here?
2708,"Jeralt: Hm? Oh. Of course you would ask that. I wouldn't know where to begin... I suppose I haven't talked much about her. She was gentle and smart. So smart. A wonderful cook. Always kind to everyone. And...she loved flowers. Whenever I brought her back an unusual flower, her face would light up. I cherish those memories. I can't count how many times she made me happy just by smiling. And she smiled the most...when she was pregnant with you. She died right after you were born. She wasn't able to spend much time with you. But she loved you with all her heart. That's the truest thing I know... Never forget it."
2709,"Jeralt: This ring is the only keepsake I have of her. In time, it will be yours. One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her."
2710,"Seteth: So, you found Jeralt visiting a grave, did you? Interesting. I would not have expected him to know anyone buried here. Still...none of my business, I suppose."
2711,"Seteth: Instructing your students should always be your foremost priority, but that does not mean you can grow complacent. You must keep up with your own training as well."
2712,Seteth: I am pleased to see you are taking your training seriously. I look forward to a strong showing from you and your students.
2713,Rhea: It is not always easy to adjust to life here at the monastery. I am sure the transition has been less than comfortable for some of your students. Perhaps you can help them.
2714,Rhea: It seems you have done well at fulfilling your duty as a professor. I look forward to watching you blossom here.
2715,Flayn: I cannot believe how poorly maintained the saint statues are. Just look at them... Clutter at their feet as though that is even remotely acceptable!
2716,Flayn: How wonderful! Where the saint statues dwell looks so much better now. Perhaps you will receive a special blessing for carrying out such an important task!
2717,"Blacksmith: I'm running low on supplies. Soon, I won't have anything left for forging weapons or making repairs. Sorry to bother you with this, but can you fetch some materials for me?"
2718,"Blacksmith: How helpful. So, you want to repair that sword? I'll give you the necessary materials for free just this once."
2719,"Merchant: Bandits have overrun my trade route. Please, can you clear them out so that the merchants can reach the monastery?"
2720,"Merchant: Thanks to you, I feel safe again. Oh, and I'll be sure to have the days that traveling merchants will be visiting the monastery added to the calendar."
2721,"Rhea: I understand that you sometimes extend invitations to have tea... I've been so busy lately, but I would deeply enjoy the opportunity to share tea with you."
2722,"Rhea: It's wonderful to spend time with someone dear to me. It reminds me of days long since past... Should you wish to share tea again, I would gladly accept."
2723,"Anna: It seems that there are some rare, valuable secrets circulating on the battlefield. I'd like you to collect a number for these for me, should you have an opportunity to do so."
2724,"Anna: Ah, you've collected some trade secrets for me! I really, really appreciate it! I'll just take them... Hehehe, perfect... What? Nothing! Just talking to myself. See you later!"
2725,"Soldier: Professor, have you really never visited the sauna? It's popular with the students, the knights...everyone, really! It's the perfect place to relax and wash your worries away. Give it a try!"
2726,Soldier: Well? I bet you're feeling refreshed and relaxed and ready to take on the world! Make as much use of the sauna as you want—there's never a bad time to take a break!
2727,Edelgard: This weather is unfortunate. Those villagers were right when they said a storm was brewing. But they were more afraid of an attack than they were of the storm. Let's end this quickly.
2728,Hubert: The thieves have taken Conand Tower as their base... There it is in the distance.
2729,Edelgard: Miklan must be more skilled than your average thief to have overtaken a place like that.
2730,"Gilbert: This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it."
2731,"Edelgard: You know your history, Gilbert. If I recall correctly, you're from the Kingdom aren't you?"
2732,"Gilbert: I left my home long ago. If you have any questions about the mission, I'd be happy to answer them."
2733,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you know about House Gautier?
Choice 2: What do you know about the leader of the thieves?"
2734,Choice 1: What do you know about House Gautier?
2735,Choice 2: What do you know about the leader of the thieves?
2736,Gilbert: House Gautier has always placed great importance on whether or not someone bears a Crest. Margrave Gautier has two sons. A Crest never manifested for his eldest. It's not hard to imagine why he left and wound up in this sort of life.
2737,"Edelgard: There's no reason that Crests should have the power to dictate someone's destiny. Don't you agree, Gilbert? He was just another victim of cruel fate. Forsaken by the goddess, who now demands his execution."
2738,"Dimitri: It should be in our sights soon, Professor. The abandoned tower those thieves are using as a base... Conand Tower."
2739,"Gilbert: This area was the site of a massive battle several hundred years ago. That's when invasions from the north were at their peak. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it."
2740,"Dimitri: You're very well informed, Gilbert. Please, tell us more."
2741,"Gilbert: Well, I... Ah. You're joking."
2742,"Dimitri: Professor. Did you see the local villages? They were in rough shape, no doubt because of the thief attacks. They're not going to make it through the winter in that condition. If the thieves had taken up pillaging in order to survive, that would be deplorable...but understandable. But this... This is something else entirely. It looks as though they destroyed those villages purely for pleasure. No matter what their reasons may be, that sort of behavior cannot be allowed. Ever."
2743,"Sylvain: Don't bother losing your head over those lowlifes, Your Highness. It's wasted effort."
2744,"Dimitri: Sylvain... The thieves' leader...the one who stole the Relic. Word has it he's your older brother. I know he's been disowned, but..."
2745,Sylvain: He is no longer a member of House Gautier...or my brother. He's nothing more than a common thief.
2746,"Dimitri: Are you sure about that? It would be understandable to find this situation...well, regrettable, to say the least."
2747,"Sylvain: Regrets? Heh, you must be joking. You know we're far past the point of regret. And it always falls on the younger brother to clean up the mistakes of their elders, doesn't it?"
2748,Dimitri: This rain threatens a coming storm. We must hurry and begin our war council before the heavens let loose.
2749,"Claude: Say, Teach. This must be the tower, don't you think? Even for a tower, it's pretty.. er, towering."
2750,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's more like a fortress.
Choice 2: It would prove difficult to attack."
2751,Choice 1: It's more like a fortress.
2752,Choice 2: It would prove difficult to attack.
2753,"Claude: It's a remnant of ancient wars... These thieves certainly found themselves a great place to nest. I hear their leader, Miklan, is a former noble. It makes sense he would already know about this place."
2754,"Gilbert: Several hundred years ago, this was an important stronghold for diffusing invasions from the north. Back then, this tower was built for both surveillance and defense. It will be difficult to seize it."
2755,"Claude: Gilbert, isn't it? You hail from the Kingdom, right? No wonder you're so knowledgeable. While we're chatting so amicably... Do you mind if I ask some questions?"
2756,"Gilbert: I don't mind. If I can answer them, I will."
2757,Claude: Have you ever seen the Lance of Ruin?
2758,"Gilbert: I have. A long time ago. It was an impressive, if not eerily ominous, weapon to behold. According to Margrave Gautier, Miklan has used the lance to turn the tables on his pursuers."
2759,"Claude: Is that right? Then those without a Crest can use it as well... Interesting. As far as I knew, that wasn't possible. And then we have the mythical Sword of the Creator, which can't be used by anyone except Teach, Crest or no Crest. Maybe you're just that special, Teach. Or maybe there's something you're not telling us. Either way, I expect big things from you in this battle."
2760,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Leave it to me.
Claude: Ha! I love a good show of confidence. I'll do my best too. You can count on it.
Choice 2: I'm relying on you, Claude.
Claude: Are you now? Then why don't you hand over the Sword of the Creator for a bit? Then again, it would just be a heavy blade in my hands. There's no justice in this world, Teach."
2761,"Choice 1: Leave it to me.
Claude: Ha! I love a good show of confidence. I'll do my best too. You can count on it."
2762,Claude: Ha! I love a good show of confidence. I'll do my best too. You can count on it.
2763,"Choice 2: I'm relying on you, Claude.
Claude: Are you now? Then why don't you hand over the Sword of the Creator for a bit? Then again, it would just be a heavy blade in my hands. There's no justice in this world, Teach."
2764,"Claude: Are you now? Then why don't you hand over the Sword of the Creator for a bit? Then again, it would just be a heavy blade in my hands. There's no justice in this world, Teach."
2765,"Claude: Ugh, the rain is really coming down now. Let's finish this quickly."
2766,Suggested Level: 9
2767,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
2768,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude falls in battle."
2769,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
2770,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude falls in battle.
2771,Gilbert: The enemy is close by. We're almost to the top floor.
2772,"Edelgard: They have nowhere left to flee, so the situation is in our favor. All we have to do is chase then down."
2773,Gilbert: The enemy is close by. We're almost to the top floor.
2774,"Dimitri: They are merely thieves, but they have a Hero's Relic. Do not drop your guard."
2775,Gilbert: The enemy is close by. We're almost to the top floor.
2776,"Claude: Phew, why did we have to climb so high before a battle? At least it's better than fighting in heavy rain."
2777,Sylvain: Don't hold back for my sake. My brother is going to pay for everything he's done.
2778,"Rogue: The captain's in trouble! Hurry up, you fools!"
2779,Gilbert: Enemies approach from the lower floor! Watch the rear flank!
2780,Rogue: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!
2781,Gilbert: It's an ambush!
2782,"Miklan: Why have you come, you Crest-bearing fool?"
2783,"Sylvain: I'm here for the Lance of Ruin, Miklan. Hand it over. I don't want to humiliate you, but I will."
2784,Miklan: Hmph! Hurry up and die already. If not for you... If it hadn't been for you...
2785,Sylvain: Shut up! I'm so tired of hearing that. You've always blamed me for something that isn't my fault.
2786,"Miklan: So, you think you can take the lance from me, huh? I'll kill you... I'll kill every last one of you!"
2787,Miklan: Not bad for your kind... A bunch of spoiled rotten children.
2788,Miklan: What the hell?!
2789,Bandit: Damn! Look at that... I'm outta here!
2790,Bandit: Hold on!
2791,Bandit: No!
2792,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2793,"Sothis: That form... Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing? Then listen well to what I say.
Guide to combat with monsters"
2794,Guide to combat with monsters
2795,Edelgard: Such is the fate of one whose life is corrupted by a Crest Stone... How pitiable. The least we can do is put an end to his suffering.
2796,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2797,Sylvain: What the–Miklan?! Is that you?!
2798,"Sothis: That form... Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing? Then listen well to what I say.

2799,Guide to combat with monsters
2800,"Dimitri: So, this is the power of a Hero's Relic. To create such a sinister beast... It has gone too far. I fear all we can do now is put an end to it."
2801,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2802,"Sothis: That form... Oh my. Is this your first time fighting such a thing? Then listen well to what I say.

2803,Guide to combat with monsters
2804,"Claude: How awful...So the Heroes' Relics are hiding such a terrible power within. I can't even tell friend from foe anymore. I feel for him, but...the best we can do now is finish this quickly."
2805,Sothis: An evil power has caused them to grow quite large. Their life force is beyond a mortal like yourself. You cannot win unless you fell them twice or even thrice!
2806,"Sothis: Even if you've cornered one, you cannot let your guard down! Those things are even worse when threatened."
2807,"Sothis: Can you see that barrier? It is surrounded by great power. You must break through to fight that thing. A strong attack or gambit might help to break through more quickly. If you can break the barrier, that power will have nowhere else to go, and that will likely cause confusions for that thing. It cannot counter while confused, which means that is the best time to attack!"
2808,"Sothis: If you break down all of their barriers, not only will they be confused, they will not be able to move for a short while. Without the power flowing around them, they will not be able to restore their barriers. You might even be able to get something from them."
2809,Sothis: They have such might that they will not fear you alone. But a battalion could prove useful on that front... Attack them with a gambit to draw their attention and force them to target you.
2810,"Sothis: Be on your guard when they have realized their full power! The damaged caused at times like that is not contained to just one spot. Once they have charged some power ups, their barriers will be restored. You really must pay close attention to those things! Distract them with a gambit, or just take them down before they can attack. In any case, think carefully before you act!"
2811,"Sothis: But you should be conquering that thing instead of talking to me! If you're out of questions, get over there and fight!"
2812,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2813,Sylvain: What is that? It's like watching a bad dream come to life.
2814,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2815,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2816,"Gilbert: Goddess... The beast is gone, yet Miklan and the Lance remain."
2817,Edelgard: It is done. Let's retrieve the lance and depart at once.
2818,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2819,"Gilbert: Goddess... The beast is gone, yet Miklan and the Lance remain."
2820,Dimitri: It's over... Let's retrieve the lance and leave this place.
2821,Black Beast: Graaaargh!
2822,"Gilbert: Goddess... The beast is gone, yet Miklan and the Lance remain."
2823,"Claude: We defeated him, somehow... Let's grab the lance and return to the monastery."
2824,Sylvain: Miklan...my brother...
2825,"Sothis: That man... His form was changed. It was as though that lance was swallowing him whole. Upon that sight, it makes sense that your students were upset. I wonder if those Relics truly hide such power? Yet even still, that power seems familiar. That form as well... As one who wields the Sword of the Creator... Does that mean you possess that power too?"
2826,"Rhea: Professor, you have returned. The goddess is indeed generous with her divine protection. I have already heard Gilbert's report about what happened. See to it that you keep what transpired at the tower to yourself. People would lose faith in the nobles should rumors spread of one using a Relic and transforming into a monster. All regions of Fódlan would fall into chaos. We must avoid that at all costs. Please ensure the students who accompanied you understand that as well. Have I made myself clear?"
2827,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes, of course. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Choice 2: Hm..."
2828,"Choice 1: Yes, of course. (Relationship with Rhea up)"
2829,Choice 2: Hm...
2830,Rhea: His transformation into a Black Beast was nothing short of divine punishment from the goddess. Punishment for someone arrogant and foolish enough to use a Hero's Relic even though they were unworthy and unqualified.
2831,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You knew?
Rhea: Of course. That is why we rushed to recover it. Sadly, we did not arrive in time.
Choice 2: Will I share the same fate...
Rhea: If someone without a Crest were to wield the Relic you possess, they would likely meet the same fate as Miklan. You, however, have been chosen. You are worthy of wielding the Sword of the Creator, so there is no need to worry."
2832,"Choice 1: You knew?
Rhea: Of course. That is why we rushed to recover it. Sadly, we did not arrive in time."
2833,"Rhea: Of course. That is why we rushed to recover it. Sadly, we did not arrive in time."

2835,"Rhea: If someone without a Crest were to wield the Relic you possess, they would likely meet the same fate as Miklan. You, however, have been chosen. You are worthy of wielding the Sword of the Creator, so there is no need to worry."
2836,Rhea: The church will formally return the lance to House Gautier. If you would...
2837,"Byleth:
Choice 1: As you wish. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: You have my gratitude. I can see that I was right to trust you with this. Please report back. I will tell you of your new mission for the coming moon at that time.
Choice 2: I will not. (Only available if Sylvain is part of player's house. Relationship with Rhea down)
Rhea: What is the meaning of this?
Sylvain: Ahem, excuse me. (Sylvain joins them) Lady Rhea, I am overjoyed and beyond grateful to you for recovering the Relic of my family, House Gautier. Now, may I please have that lance? I have received direct approval from my father to take possession of it.
Rhea: As the next head of House Gautier, do you swear that you will never cause such a deplorable incident to transpire?
Sylvain: On my family's name...and on my brother's life, I swear it.
Rhea: Very well. However, I have one condition. You must never allow another to wield this lance. Your brother clearly demonstrated what fate awaits those who break that restriction.
Sylvain: Yes. I...I will not soon forget."

2847,Edelgard: I assume the archbishop was pleased with your performance. Did you return the Lance of Ruin?
2848,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I returned it.
Edelgard: (If Sylvain is part of player's house.) No need to lie, Professor. I saw Sylvain earlier. It was written all over his face. (Relationship with Edelgard down)
(No additional dialogue or Support points if Sylvain is not part of player's house.)

2855,Edelgard: I keep thinking about what Gilbert told us...
2856,"Byleth:
Choice 1: About Miklan?
Choice 2: About House Gautier?"
2857,Choice 1: About Miklan?
2858,Choice 2: About House Gautier?
2859,"Edelgard: Yes, Miklan was discarded by his family because he was born without a Crest. Eventually he became a masterful thief and gathered enough ruffians to capture a fortress. Right or wrong, he was a gifted leader. He could have been a great asset to Fódlan. What a waste. It's true that a Crest can increase your magical abilities and allow you to wield the full might of a Hero's Relic. But one cannot measure a leader's worth based solely on whether or not they bear a Crest. There are plenty of talented people in this world without one."
2860,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I completely agree.
Choice 2: Why is everyone obsessed with Crests?"
2861,Choice 1: I completely agree.
2862,Choice 2: Why is everyone obsessed with Crests?
2863,"Edelgard: People believe Crests are blessings from the goddess, that they're necessary to maintain order in Fódlan. But the people are wrong. Crests are to blame for this brutal, irrational world we live in. Their power is granted only to a select few, whom we elevate and allow to rule the world. Have you ever wondered if the only way to create a truly free world is to dispense with the goddess and the Crests? Do that, and people will have no choice but to rise and fall by their own merits."
2864,Hubert: Lady Edelgard. I question whether you revealed too much to the professor.
2865,Edelgard: Perhaps I did.
2866,Hubert: It is true that our teacher possesses a rare talent. Even I cannot deny it. The ability to wield the Sword of the Creator is concerning...
2867,Edelgard: I've already explained this to you. My power alone is insufficient. That's why I'm borrowing power from those people. If our teacher can wield it in my stead... I believe that would be for the best.
2868,Hubert: It's a risk. A dangerous one. You leave me no choice but to take matters into my own hands. Please excuse me.
2869,"Edelgard: I can't hide from the truth. I can't do all that I must on my own. If all I can rely on is my own ambition, my path won't be easy. Is it so risky...to reach out my hand? Father... I swear I will not stop until I succeed. My regret. My grief. My whole life. I've thrown it all away...into the darkness..."
2870,"Dimitri: Is your meeting over, Professor?"
2871,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You look troubled.
Choice 2: Are you weary?"
2872,Choice 1: You look troubled.
2873,Choice 2: Are you weary?
2874,"Dimitri: I was just thinking about something. Professor... The possession of Relics and Crests has been highly valued in Faerghus since ancient times. It's far from uncommon for someone to lose their ability to lead their house because they don't bear a Crest. Just like Miklan. It happened to my uncle as well. The eldest child of the king, and yet he never ascended to the throne. All families whose bloodlines carry Crests of the 10 Elites are much the same. But House Gautier takes it a step further, and absolutely requires an heir who possesses a Crest."
2875,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why are they so obsessed with it?
Choice 2: Why House Gautier in particular?"
2876,Choice 1: Why are they so obsessed with it?
2877,Choice 2: Why House Gautier in particular?
2878,"Dimitri: To that house, the power of Crests is a necessity, not a luxury. House Gautier holds the most northern territory in the Kingdom, and they have fought with the people to the north for many years. The head of that house is responsible for protecting that territory from fearsome invaders, whom they keep at bay with the power of Crests and Relics. In exchange for that responsibility, they are granted special privileges within the Kingdom."
2879,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Their Crests grant them special privileges?
Dimitri: In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone...
Choice 2: Strength is strength, with or without a Crest.
Dimitri: I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone."
2880,"Choice 1: Their Crests grant them special privileges?
Dimitri: In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone..."
2881,"Dimitri: In a way. That said, ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone..."
2882,"Choice 2: Strength is strength, with or without a Crest.
Dimitri: I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone."
2883,Dimitri: I believe the same. Ability cannot be measured by the possession of a Crest alone.
2884,"Dimitri: I believe that Margrave Gautier was wrong to disinherit Miklan because he did not bear a Crest. Still, there is always a reason for why such customs stand the test of time. Imagine what this world would be like if no one placed any stock in Crests... Bloodlines that carry Crests would dwindle. The metaphorical blade used to oppose threats would eventually rest. This same argument has been made time and time again across the years. Both sides are at once right and wrong."
2885,"Byleth: What do you believe, Dimitri?"
2886,"Dimitri: I believe those with Crests and those without should acknowledge the others' strengths and learn to respect each other based on personal merits. And that doesn't apply only to Crests. The same holds true for lineage, race, faith, ideologies... If we could just accept each other and make mutual concessions, one step at a time... Perhaps... Who knows if that's even possible. Everyone has something that is unacceptable within them. I certainly do, and I'd wager you do as well. I wonder which is best, Professor... To cut away that which is unacceptable, or to find a way to accept it anyway..."
2887,"Claude: Nice work, Teach. It's thanks to you that we successfully completed our mission. As for Miklan... I wonder if he really believed he could wield a Relic."
2888,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Hard to say.
Claude: I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
Claude: Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile."
2889,"Choice 1: Hard to say.
Claude: I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it."
2890,"Claude: I bet he just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew he couldn't use it."
2891,"Choice 2: I doubt it.
Claude: Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile."
2892,"Claude: Agreed. He probably just wanted to get his hands on it, even though he knew it was futile."
2893,Claude: Though I'm sure he wasn't counting on turning into a monster like that... I wonder if that monster represents another aspect of the Heroes' Relics. What a strange and terrifying power.
2894,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Choice 2: It seems so."
2895,Choice 1: I don't know.
2896,Choice 2: It seems so.
2897,Tomas: Stories of misfortune have followed the Heroes' Relics since ancient times.
2898,Claude: Tomas! You've caught me by surprise. That's not easy to do. Though I suppose I should've expected to see our librarian in his library.
2899,"Tomas: I am sorry to intrude. I simply heard you speaking of the Heroes' Relics. I can tell you more about them, if you'd like. The story goes that Nemesis was corrupted by evil because of the Sword of the Creator. Other Heroes also lost themselves by continuing to use the Relics...transforming into Black Beasts with twisted souls. There used to be a great many records regarding the dark history of the Relics."
2900,Claude: Used to be?
2901,"Tomas: They have been destroyed, across all of Fódlan. Stripped from their shelves, including those that resided at this very library."
2902,"Claude: You make it sound like the church is covering up the truth. But now that you mention it, Rhea was very specific about not wanting anyone to find out what happened at Conand Tower. Hey Tomas... why are you telling us all this?"
2903,"Tomas: It seemed like you were searching for answers about the Relics. What is a librarian if not a guide in the search for knowledge. And not only have you been searching, but you have been doing so through the night. I would suggest you stop before the knights notice. And that is enough meddling for today. Please excuse me."
2904,Byleth: What are you after?
2905,"Claude: Teach... You don't really expect me to tell you something so personal like that, do you? Though, I wouldn't mind sharing if you were to tell me some of your secrets in exchange..."
2906,"Edelgard: I can't let this exchange pass without comment... If you're sharing secrets, perhaps I can share one as well?"
2907,Claude: Are you sure you could survive that? I'd say you're the least likely to share secrets out of everyone at the academy.
2908,"Edelgard: Heh heh, coming from you, I'll take that as a compliment. After all, you're easily the student with the most secrets."
2909,Claude: I'm afraid you overestimate me. My secrets don't amount to much. But back to Teach...
2910,"Edelgard: Don't try to change the subject, Claude. We're talking about secrets. Yours. Who is your father? And why did you appear so suddenly, as if from nowhere? Duke Riegan's eldest son died in an accident. Having tragically lost other family members as well, he was without an heir. The Alliance would undoubtedly have been shaken if House Riegan had lost its position of leadership. But then you showed up. Why did you return to House Riegan? What brought you to the monastery?"
2911,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I would like to hear this as well. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Choice 2: He doesn't have have to answer to you. (Relationship with Claude up)"
2912,Choice 1: I would like to hear this as well. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
2913,Choice 2: He doesn't have have to answer to you. (Relationship with Claude up)
2914,"Claude:
(if Byleth is male) Oh boy. I'm trapped here. I have not choice but to surrender under your intimidating gazes.
(if Byleth is female) Alas...to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers, only to be pricked by their thorns."
2915,(if Byleth is male) Oh boy. I'm trapped here. I have not choice but to surrender under your intimidating gazes.
2916,"(if Byleth is female) Alas...to be surrounded by women as lovely as flowers, only to be pricked by their thorns."
2917,"Claude: My dream, in truth, is a selfless dream. But I require power to make it a reality. When I learned about the power of my Crest, I knew I had a chance. So I'm chasing that dream. To the bitter end, if need be. I came to this monastery because I thought I might find someone useful. Someone to help me on my path. So, what do you think? If you promise to help me achieve my dream no matter what, I'll promise to tell you anything."
2918,Edelgard: (shakes head) I have my own dream to tend to. I pray that yours does not interfere with mine.
2919,"Claude: What about you, Teach?"
2920,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If it's a noble dream... (Relationship with Claude up)
Choice 2: That may be difficult."
2921,Choice 1: If it's a noble dream... (Relationship with Claude up)
2922,Choice 2: That may be difficult.
2923,"Claude: I see. Well, now isn't the time to discuss this. You are still my Teach, after all."
2924,"Rhea: Professor, you have done well to complete such a difficult task. You have shown exceptional skill in leading your students. I am forever grateful for the safe return of the Hero's Relic. Just as I expected, you have mastered the Sword of the Creator. Now then, I shall tell you about your mission for the coming month..."
2925,Seteth: (panicked) Rhe– Archbishop!
2926,"Rhea: Seteth, what troubles you?"
2927,"Seteth: Flayn is missing! I cannot find her anywhere! (Seteth turns to Byleth) Professor, have you seen Flayn recently?"
2928,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have not.
Seteth: I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!
Choice 2: Have you looked everywhere?
Seteth: I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere."
2929,"Choice 1: I have not.
Seteth: I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!"
2930,Seteth: I have searched everywhere! Where could she be?!
2931,"Choice 2: Have you looked everywhere?
Seteth: I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere."
2932,Seteth: I have searched every corner I can think of! I could not find her anywhere.
2933,"Seteth: She may be in danger! Oh no... No, no! What am I to do?!"
2934,"Rhea: Calm yourself, Seteth. Professor, we shall continue our discussion another time."
2935,"As cold air begins to creep in from the north of Faerghus, Fódlan welcomes the riches of fall. The women spend their days reaping the golden fields, gratefully embracing the bounty the goddess has once again provided. The men venture into the wild with horsebows and empty sacks ready to be filled with game.

3019,"Rhea: As I believe you are already aware, Seteth's younger sister, Flayn, has gone missing. At present, all we know for certain is that she has not left Garreg Mach."
3020,"Seteth: Flayn is not the type of person to just wander off on her own without telling me where she is going! We have searched the monastery thoroughly, but have found nothing. I am now mobilizing the knights to begin searching the town. Troubling rumors have been running rampant lately. I do not wish to consider the worst, but..."
3021,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Troubling rumors?
Choice 2: What is it you're afraid of?"
3022,Choice 1: Troubling rumors?
3023,Choice 2: What is it you're afraid of?
3024,"Rhea: There are rumors of someone prowling the streets and attacking innocents, night after night. The knights have investigated the matter. They have not discovered any remains, nor have they found any concrete evidence."
3025,Seteth: The people are panicked! They all insist someone called the Death Knight is coming to claim their souls with his blade. There is no way she could have escaped unscathed if she were captured by such a fiend! Where is she?!
3026,"Rhea: Seteth, recall that impatience begets error. Please do your best to calm yourself. I think of your...sister as family as well. You know that. You have my support. We will devote ourselves fully–mind, body, and soul–to recovering her. (To Byleth) Professor. Your mission for this month is to help find Flayn. The knights have the town covered, so I ask that you focus your efforts on searching the monastery again. We do not have time to waste. You have your orders."
3027,Hubert: Flayn has gone missing? Most unsettling.
3028,Edelgard: It doesn't seem likely that she's simply gotten lost. I'll help in any way that I can.
3029,"Ferdinand: So, our mission this month is to find her? Well then, let us hurry and locate her before anyone else!"
3030,Bernadetta: I hope Flayn is OK! What would happen if... Just what would we do if...
3031,"Dorothea: You can't think like that, Bern. Seteth would have a heart attack if he heard you."
3032,"Linhardt: I've heard that she has a Crest, but I suppose, for this moment, that is irrelevant."
3033,Hubert: We'll start by gathering information. Someone must have seen Flayn recently.
3034,"Edelgard: Right. If we work together, I'm certain we'll find her."
3035,Dimitri: Flayn has disappeared? Seteth must be beside himself.
3036,"Sylvain: So finding little Flayn is our mission for this moon? Leave it to me, Professor. Chasing after girls is my specialty."
3037,Ingrid: Sylvain... Even you must agree that now isn't the time for jokes.
3038,Annette: I hope Flayn is OK. I've heard rumors about some Death Knight running around town...
3039,Felix: Sounds intriguing. I had been hoping to cross blades with him.
3040,Ingrid: Felix! Please consider how Seteth must be feeling right now.
3041,"Dimitri: In any case, we must start our search at once. Every moment matters. On your order, Professor, let's try to collect as much information as we can."
3042,Hilda: What? Flayn is missing?!
3043,"Claude: So, finding Flayn is our mission for the month, I take it?"
3044,Raphael: Wait. Who's Flayn?
3045,Leonie: Seteth's little sister. Surely you've seen her flitting about the monastery.
3046,"Lysithea: She is the girl who looks about the same age as me, but seems well beyond her years."
3047,"Hilda: Seteth is much older than Flayn. He's always looking out for her. He must be worried sick. If I were to go missing, I can't imagine what that would do to my brother."
3048,"Claude: When searching for someone, it's best to start by gathering information. Hopefully someone has seen Flayn."
3049,Dedue: I'm on the lookout for suspicious individuals. The only place I've yet to check is the library.
3050,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll go together.
Dedue: As you wish.
Choice 2: Get some rest. (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: As you wish. After I check the library."

3054,Dedue: As you wish. After I check the library.
3055,Dedue: Candlelight... And who is that?
3056,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is it Flayn?
Choice 2: Is it the Death Knight?"
3057,Choice 1: Is it Flayn?
3058,Choice 2: Is it the Death Knight?
3059,"Dedue: No, it isn't. Impossible..."
3060,Dimitri: Professor. Dedue. What are you up to at this hour?
3061,Dedue: Your Highness! My apologies.
3062,"Dimitri: Oh, none necessary. I'm sorry for startling you. I was just doing some research. But I'm just about finished. I didn't realize how late it had gotten. We'd better head back to our quarters, Dedue. Until tomorrow, Professor."
3063,Sothis: A most unusual man! Whatever could he have been looking for so late at night? Hm? That book is quite askew... He must have rushed to put it back upon the shelf.
3064,Byleth: ...
3065,"Sothis: It seems to be a record of donations from nobility. Arundel... That's not a name I know. But look at that! This Arundel gave quite a sum each year... That is, until the year 1174. He must have died or fallen to financial woe. Hmm... I can't imagine what this has to do with Flayn."
3066,Sothis: Oh my... Just one small girl who's gone astray has caused all this. We cannot let this stand. You must do all you can to find out where's she's gone. Now ask around to see what information you can find. Come now! No time to waste!
3067,"Edelgard: We must begin our search for Flayn, Professor. If she ran off on her own free will, that's her business. But that may not be the case. For her sake, I suggest we assume that she was abducted and begin an investigation. Who benefits from kidnapping her? Let's gather all the information we can on anyone who's been acting strangely."
3068,Edelgard: Manuela ran off with Jeritza's mask? Hmm... We'll have to speak with both of them. But where could Manuela be? Jertiza is likely at the training grounds or in his quarters on the eastern side of the knights' hall.
3069,Edelgard: Flayn is missing... We should split up and search for her. There isn't a moment to waste. We must find her before it's too late.
3070,"Dimitri: When I consider how Seteth must be feeling, my heart breaks. We must find Flayn as soon as possible. There are no signs of her having left the monastery, but we cannot safely rule out any possibility just yet. I'm wasting precious time standing about trying to think of a solution. I'll survey the monastery and see what information I can gather. There must be someone who has a clue as to Flayn's whereabouts."
3071,Dimitri: What? Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? I have a bad feeling about this... We must find them both at once! Professor Jeritza will be at the training grounds or his quarters. I believe the latter can be found on the eastern side of the knights' hall.
3072,"Dimitri: I have thoroughly surveyed the entire monastery, and yet I have not found a single trace of evidence that suggests Flayn was abducted. Perhaps we must seek out personal recounts rather than physical evidence... In any case, we must hurry before something terrible happens."
3073,"Claude: No sign of her leaving the monastery, eh? That is, assuming we can actually trust that information..."
3074,"Hilda: Oh, but I'm sure this space has no shortage of secret passages and hiding spots!"
3075,"Claude: True. For now, there's not much we can do aside from making a thorough search of the monastery."
3076,Hilda: Let's ask around and see what we turn up. You never know who might have seen something.
3077,Claude: Professor Manuela ran off with Professor Jeritza's mask? What could that possibly mean?
3078,"Hilda: Well, that's suspicious! Sounds like we should try talking to them."
3079,"Claude: Professor Jeritza is almost certainly in the training grounds or his quarters. Where was that again? Oh, over on the eastern side of the knights' hall."
3080,"Claude: Flayn's gone missing? Where could she be? If it were an ordinary kidnapping, you'd think there'd be a demand for ransom or something by now. I don't like the sound of this..."
3081,"Hubert: If Flayn has been taken hostage, then we know she is alive. At least for now. There would be no point to abducting her if simple murder was the objective. That's only logical, Professor."
3082,"Ferdinand: A beautiful, delicate maiden vanishing into thin air... It is like something out of a book. If it were a book, we would have no need to worry! She would be rescued presently by a dashing nobleman. Do you have any idea as to where she might be? Where she might have wandered off to?"
3083,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Perhaps she went looking for treats? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: That is what I thought! Why I am here, in fact. But she is nowhere to be seen.
Choice 2: To the greenhouse, for some flowers?
Ferdinand: Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later."
3084,"Choice 1: Perhaps she went looking for treats? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: That is what I thought! Why I am here, in fact. But she is nowhere to be seen."

Ferdinand: Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later."
3087,"Ferdinand: Hmm, the greenhouse. I did not think of that. I will take a look around there later."
3088,"Linhardt: Flayn? No, I haven't seen her. She's been abducted. Oh, you're looking for her. Sorry, my mind was somewhere else. I just recently learned she has a Crest. Did you know that, Professor? If it was a particularly rare Crest, I could imagine Professor Hanneman would have quite an intense interest in her. Oh, no, I'm not accusing Professor Hanneman of abducting Flayn."
3089,Caspar: I don't know if she ran off or got kidnapped or what! I just know that Flayn's in trouble. That's it! I can't keep sitting around. I gotta go find her! Now where do I start?
3090,"Bernadetta: Uh, Flayn's not in here! Ugh, I guess I have to let you in to prove it, don't I?"
3091,"Bernadetta: There. See? No one's in Bernie's room but Bernie. Maybe Flayn just wanted to be alone for a while. Have you considered that? Come to think of it, where is her room, anyway?"
3092,"Dorothea: Hey, Professor, have you seen Manuela? I saw her running off somewhere in a terrible hurry. I wonder if it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance. Do you know, Professor?"
3093,Byleth: You're on first-name terms with Professor Manuela?
3094,"Dorothea: Oh, yes. Didn't you know? She was the senior diva in our Opera Company."
3095,"Petra: Flayn was childnapped. That is what you are thinking? And the villain is inside our monastery? Hmm. I must have admittance. One person...has been catching my eye. Shamir is a knight not like other knights. Her movements are being reminders of...no, they remind me of warriors of Brigid. Before she was here, what was she getting up to..."
3096,"Dedue: I've heard the monastery is full of secret passages. If there is no sign of Flayn's departure, it's possible that she used one of those. Whatever has happened, I hope she is all right."
3097,"Felix: Ah, you're looking for Flayn's kidnapper. I can't say anything for sure, but I do have suspicions about Jeritza. There's something about how he's handling his blade lately. It seems more...impulsive than usual. It couldn't hurt to try speaking with him, at least. At this hour, I think you'll find him sparring with Catherine at the training grounds."
3098,Ashe: I heard something like this happened last year too. Neither the culprit nor the missing student were ever found last time. Some people say it was the work of evil spirits.

3120,"Annette: Whether the rumors are true or not, I just hope our Flayn is safe..."
3121,"Ingrid: To think that Flayn would disappear like this... Seteth must be worried sick. I haven't got much to go off of, and perhaps it's out of line for me to feel so uncomfortable... But something has been bothering me for a while about Gilbert. I feel as though I've met him somewhere before... I also noticed him staring intently at Annette once. Hmm..."
3122,"Lorenz: If Flayn were taken hostage, I expect we would have received demands from the culprit by now. Perhaps this is not a kidnapping at all. Do you suppose she could have simply run away?"
3123,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's possible. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: If that is the case, it is unlikely that we will find her anywhere in the monastery.
Choice 2: I don't think so.

3128,"Raphael: I hope Flayn isn't going hungry. If someone really kidnapped her, I'll never forgive them! Now that I think about it, I saw Alois hanging out by the pond not too long ago. He was always getting into trouble for trying to talk to Flayn, you know. It's probably a crazy thought, but I'm starting to worry."
3129,Ignatz: I've only ever spoken to Flayn a handful of times. She always seemed so naive about the ways of the world. I'm worried about her.
3130,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You think she'd be easily deceived? (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Yes, I'm afraid so. I just hope she comes home safe.

3135,"Lysithea: Reflecting on it now, Flayn has always seemed a rather odd person. She appears young, yet there's something about her that seems much older than her years suggest. And she's quite wise, but also surprisingly naive..."
3136,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Maybe she's lived a very sheltered life. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: Hmm, you might be right. Whatever the case, Seteth seems to care for her more than anything.

3141,"Marianne: Dear Goddess, hear my prayer... Please watch over Flayn... Please protect her..."
3142,Hilda: I bet Flayn ran away. She couldn't stand being held back by Seteth any longer. I can emphasize. I know what it's like to have an overbearing big brother.
3143,Leonie: Where could Flayn have gone? Do you think she's really been kidnapped? I hear Tomas has been going around asking about her... But he's probably just worried like the rest of us. Though it wasn't just Flayn. He was asking about you and Captain Jeralt too.
3144,"Rhea: Professor, have you still not found any leads regarding Flayn's whereabouts? I have looked everywhere. Not even the knights on guard have seen anything of note."

3184,"Jeralt: Because of Flayn's disappearance, all of the knights are searching nonstop. But we haven't found a single lead. Seteth's face is getting paler by the minute. It's hard to watch.

3197,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why were you asking about Flayn?
Tomas: I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister.

3203,"Cyril: I can't believe Flayn just disappeared. I don't like it one little bit. Oh, are you here to see someone? Alois and Shamir and all the knights are gonna head into town soon."
3204,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Today...there is quite a bit to report! There is a masked individual who has been going into town every evening and not returning until the following morning. You see? Nothing gets past this guard! I doubt it has anything to do with Flayn's disappearance, but... Well, better safe than sorry, I always say."
3205,"Student: Professor! I saw him! A knight wielding a gigantic scythe! He was just like the rumors say! All covered in jet-black armor! It was the Death Knight, I just know it! You don't think he has something to do with Flayn's disappearance...do you?"
3206,"Knight of Seiros: I can only imagine how worried Seteth must be, but isn't mobilizing the entire order of knights a bit...excessive? I was originally assigned to investigate those reports of the Death Knight in the town near Garreg Mach. When I think how many more victims that dastard might claim while we're all busy searching for Flayn... I'm sorry... That was insensitive. We're all under a lot of stress right now. It's important that we find her quickly."
3207,"Monk: I've served here at Garreg Mach in some capacity or another for several decades now. But after all that time, even I can't claim to know everything about the layout. Searching the entire interior of the monastery is a more difficult task than you may think. It makes you wonder who designed such a titanic compound. There are fragments of records remaining from its original construction, but none of them name an actual architect..."
3208,Monk: This might be the first time I've ever seen Seteth look so worn down. If poor Flayn was lured away by anyone... I personally think the clear suspect is that miscreant from Duscur. Those people are deceptive by nature...
3209,"Student: The whole monastery has been turned upside down! I wonder if we're still going to have the Battle of the Eagle and Lion next month. It's a yearly tradition, but with things the way they are right now...it's hard to imagine. At any rate, I hope they find Flayn soon."
3210,Byleth: (Beyond here is Jeritza's room...)
3211,"Yuri: Looking for Flayn? Some knights came looking a bit age too. I did some of my own hunting but didn't find any promising leads. I even had some of my people search for her throughout the underground...to no avail. Think about it. The monastery is some thousand years old. Who knows how many hidden passageways exist... She could be here...or anywhere, really."
3212,"Balthus: You're looking for someone? Huh. Try asking Yuri. He's good with stuff like that. I'm better at hitting things than finding them. Honestly, I didn't even know Seteth had a sister. If you figure out where she is and need some muscles, just holler. We all have our strengths. For me, my strength IS my strength."
3213,"Constance: As soon as word spread of Flayn's disappearance, the knights burst into Abyss. We tend to be the first suspects when these things happen, you see. I suppose it's little surprise when there are shady characters always coming and going..."

3231,"Edelgard: If we fail to locate Flayn soon, it will be too late. Let's assume she's been abducted, and start gathering what information we can about suspicious individuals."

3233,"Dimitri: We must locate Flayn, and soon. Let's gather all of the information we can around the monastery. Surely someone must have seen or heard something."
3234,Dimitri: I agree that Professor Jeritza's behavior is odd. We should ask him directly. I expect he'll be at the training grounds or in his quarters.
3235,"Claude: I wish we could do more for Flayn, but since we've got no leads, our only option is to search the monastery with a fine-tooth comb. Someone must know something."

Hanneman: Alas, Seteth would never allow that. However, while Flayn's Major Crest of Cethleann is rare, there are other who possess it."
3265,"Hanneman: Alas, Seteth would never allow that. However, while Flayn's Major Crest of Cethleann is rare, there are other who possess it."
3266,"Tomas: Is something the matter? I see. So, Flayn has gone missing. I will do what I can to support the search. Hm? It seems that you are a bit suspicious of me. Might I ask your reasons?"
3267,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why were you asking about Flayn?
Tomas: I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister.
Choice 2: Why were you asking about my father?
Tomas: It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him."
3268,"Choice 1: Why were you asking about Flayn?
Tomas: I was away from the monastery for a few years, but do not forget... I have spent more than four decades in total working here at Garreg Mach Monastery. Yet it was not until recently that I learned that Seteth has a sister."

3270,"Choice 2: Why were you asking about my father?
Tomas: It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him."
3271,"Tomas: It has been two decades since I last knew Jeralt, yet he looks nearly identical to my memory of him."
3272,"Tomas: It is only natural to be curious, don't you think? I assure you, there is nothing more to it than that."
3273,"Jeralt: Because of Flayn's disappearance, all of the knights are searching nonstop. But we haven't found a single lead. Seteth's face is getting paler by the minute. It's hard to watch. What's that? You're looking for Manuela? Well, I did pass by her earlier. She was carrying something. A mask of some sort..."
3274,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Jeritza's mask?
Jeralt: I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right.
Choice 2: Flayn's mask?
Jeralt: Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?"
3275,"Choice 1: Jeritza's mask?
Jeralt: I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right."
3276,"Jeralt: I'm not close to the guy, so I can't say for sure. But come to think of it, you could be right."
3277,"Choice 2: Flayn's mask?
Jeralt: Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?"
3278,Jeralt: Are you feeling all right? When have you ever seen Flayn wearing a mask?
3279,Marianne: Um. One of Dorte's...friends...is about to have a baby. Do you know of any medicinal herbs that will ensure a safe delivery?
3280,Marianne: Thank you! This medicinal herb is supposedly quite useful when administered to a horse who's about to give birth. I'm going to mix this into her feed...
3281,"Student: I poured my heart out into this letter... I'd like you to deliver it for me. To whom, you ask? Well, he's always working his hardest, and he's not very up-front with his true feelings, but he's got an adorable way about him..."
3282,Student: Thanks! I was watching him as he read the letter... It looks like it spooked him a bit. That's too bad.
3283,Edelgard: It seems Flayn is still missing. What could have happened to her?
3284,"Caspar: Everyone, hurry! I heard a scream from Professor Jeritza's room!"
3285,Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
3286,Edelgard: Professor Jeritza? Are you there?
3287,Hubert: He does not seem to be here... Hm? On the ground! Professor Manuela!
3288,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she injured?
Choice 2: Is she...dead?"
3289,Choice 1: Is she injured?
3290,Choice 2: Is she...dead?
3291,"Edelgard: No, She's unconscious. Someone clearly attacked her."
3292,Hubert: Look at her hand. It looks as though she is pointing at something... There.
3293,Edelgard: There's an opening behind that shelf. Perhaps a secret passageway...
3294,"Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here?"
3295,Edelgard: We know as much as you do. She needs to be taken to the infirmary.
3296,"Hanneman: Yes, of course–and quickly. Give me a hand, child."
3297,"Edelgard: Understood. I'll support her head. Professor, I'll be back shortly. Please be careful."
3298,Caspar: Does this mean Professor Jeritza did it? Could he also have kidnapped Flayn?!
3299,"Hubert: We should start by investigating this passageway. Do you agree, Professor?"
3300,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's investigate.
Hubert: Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside.
Choice 2: We should call for the knights.
Hubert: We don't have time for that. It would be on us if the culprit escaped."
3301,"Choice 1: Let's investigate.
Hubert: Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside."
3302,Hubert: Agreed. The culprit could be hiding inside.
3303,"Choice 2: We should call for the knights.

3304,Hubert: We don't have time for that. It would be on us if the culprit escaped.
3305,"Caspar: That settles it! We'll take the offensive. Here we come, you monsters!"
3306,"Hubert: Shall we, Professor?"
3307,Dimitri: We still don't know where Flayn is... But we can't give up. Not until she's found.
3308,Ingrid: Professor! Your Highness! I just heard a scream! In Professor Jeritza's quarters!
3309,Sothis: Jeritza... Ah! The combat professor with the mask. He has always been rather suspicious. We must hurry!
3310,Dimitri: Isn't that... Professor Manuela!
3311,Annette: Professor Manuela! Please wake up! Professor Manuela!
3312,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she injured?
Dimitri: She's still breathing...but she needs medical attention immediately!
Choice 2: Is she...dead?
Dimitri: No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!"

Dimitri: She's still breathing...but she needs medical attention immediately!"

Dimitri: No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!"
3316,"Dimitri: No, I believe she's just unconscious. But this wound requires immediate attention!"
3317,Annette: Look! Do you see Professor Manuela's hand? It's like she's pointing at something...
3318,Dimitri: I see it! Behind that shelf! Could it be a secret passage?
3319,"Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her."
3320,"Dimitri: Of course. I'll return shortly, Professor."
3321,Annette: Do you think this is related to Flayn's disappearance?
3322,"Dedue: What should we do, Professor?"
3323,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's investigate.
Annette: It looks dark...uh...dark in there.
Mercedes: Aw, you've always been scared of dark places, haven't you, Annie? But don't worry! The professor and I will protect you.
Choice 2: We should call for the knights.
Annette: You're right. We should call for help.
Ashe: But the culprit could flee while we wait! Sh-shouldn't we take a look?"
3324,"Choice 1: Let's investigate.

3330,"Dedue: There are sounds coming from within. If we're going to investigate, now is the time."
3331,"Mercedes: We'll be OK, I'm sure of it. Are you ready, Professor?"
3332,"Claude: There's still no sign of Flayn... What should we do, Teach? I'll admit, I'm out of schemes here."
3333,Ignatz: Professor! Claude! Something's very wrong. Please hurry to Professor Jeritza's room!
3334,"Claude: Knock, knock. Is anybody...whoa! Professor Manuela!"
3335,Ignatz: I heard a scream coming from here just moments ago. It must have been Professor Manuela!
3336,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she injured?
Claude: She's unconscious. She was clearly attacked by someone.
Choice 2: Is she...dead?

3340,"Claude: No, I believe she's just unconscious. It looks like she was attacked by someone."
3341,Hilda: Hey! It kind of looks like Professor Manuela is...pointing at something.
3342,Claude: So we follow where she's pointing and... Oh? What do we have here? There's a rather suspicious hole behind that shelf.
3343,"Hanneman: What is the meaning of... Wait, is that Manuela? What happened here? We must take her to the infirmary immediately. You! Don't just stand there! Help me carry her."
3344,"Claude: Right, right. Hold down the fort for me, Teach. I'll be back once we get Professor Manuela taken care of."
3345,Ignatz: What could have happened here? And where is Professor Jeritza?
3346,"Hilda: This must be related to that girl's disappearance. What if she's being held captive down there? No, no, that's crazy... Right?"
3347,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's investigate.
Ignatz: Right... It's scary, but... OK.
Hilda: Don't be a coward, Ignatz. We'll be fine as long as we stick close to the professor.
Choice 2: We should call for the knights.
Ignatz: But...what if something bad happens while we're searching for the knights?
Hilda: You mean, like, a captured girl being strangled or something?"

3355,"Hilda: We've got to investigate. Lead the way, Professor."
3356,"Ignatz: The culprit may be hiding inside, so let's be extra cautious!"
3357,Hubert: I never would have imagined... Hm? I see someone. They're unconscious.
3358,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is it Flayn?
Hubert: Yes, and there is someone else too. It appears to be another student.
Choice 2: Is it Jeritza?
Hubert: No, Professor. It's two young girls."

3363,Caspar: Someone's coming! I recognize that scythe and mask... It's that jerk we fought at the Holy Mausoleum!
3364,"Death Knight: That sword. You must be... One of us will die, the other will live. I will enjoy this dance of damnation."
3365,Annette: What is this place? It's so...BAH! I see someone! I think...they're unconscious.
3366,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is it Flayn?
Ingrid: Yes, I see Flayn! But...who is this other person?

3370,Felix: Are you blind? They're obviously female. And there are two of them.
3371,Annette: Professor! Someone's coming from farther in! That scythe... Is that the knight who attacked the Holy Mausoleum?
3372,"Death Knight: That sword. You must be... One of us will die, the other will live. I will enjoy this dance of damnation."
3373,Hilda: It's way too creepy down here. And it smells funny. And...BAH! A person! They're...unconscious.
3374,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is it Flayn?
Hilda: Yes! It's Flayn! Oh, but there's someone else too...
Choice 2: Is it Jeritza?
Hilda: Look closer, Professor. There are two girls."
3375,"Choice 1: Is it Flayn?

3386,Hubert: Our objective is to recover Flayn. Let us hope we are not too late.
3387,Hubert: Hmm. Something odd about the floor over there. What will happen if we step on it?
3388,Hubert: Contraptions in the floor. Stay alert.
3389,Hubert: Interesting apparatus. I wonder if we can operate it.
3390,"Flame Emperor Soldier: So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!"
3391,Dedue: That knight looks like death itself. We must rescue Flayn immediately.
3392,Dedue: There's something strange about the flooring at the end of the corridor. Something might happen if you step there.
3393,Dedue: Some kind of contraption has been activated.
3394,Dedue: What is this device? It appears operational.
3395,"Flame Emperor Soldier: So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!"
3396,"Hilda: Professor, we need to defeat the Death Knight, and then rescue Flayn!"
3397,Hilda: Hm. Look at that strange tile over there. I bet something will happen if you step on it.
3398,Hilda: Whoa. Look at those weird contraptions on the floor.
3399,"Hilda: I wonder what that is? Looks like you can use it, but who knows what'll happen."
3400,"Flame Emperor Soldier: So, you have come! I'll make sure you never leave!"
3401,Death Knight: I have no need of you...
3402,"Death Knight: Now, you will die together... How joyous..."
3403,Hubert: You should withdraw from here.
3404,Death Knight: I don't take orders from you...
3405,"???: Halt. You're having a bit too much fun. Bring me the women, and then step away."
3406,You have been defeated. Use Divine Pulse to turn back time.
3407,Death Knight: Kill them.
3408,???: Halt. You're having a bit too much fun.
3409,Death Knight: You are getting in the way of my game.
3410,???: Hmph. You'll have more opportunities to play soon. Your work here is done.
3411,Death Knight: Understood. I will go...
3412,???: We will cross paths again. I am the Flame Emperor... It is I who will reforge the world.
3413,Lindhardt: Flame Emperor? Rather worrisome that he sounds intent on showing up again.
3414,Ferdinand: Are they both OK? We should get them out of here.
3415,Hubert: The enemy's withdrawn. Let's carry them up.
3416,"Mercedes: Flame Emperor and the Death Knight? I have to say, they both looked very dangerous."
3417,Ingrid: Where did they go? It doesn't matter. We need to get these two out of here.
3418,Dedue: Bring them up.
3419,"Lorenz: Flame Emperor, eh? Seemed quite frightened of us if you ask me! Haha!"
3420,Leonie: He's gone. We should get these two out of here.
3421,"Hilda: Let's get out of this horrible place! C'mon, we can carry them up."
3422,"Linhardt: They're pale, and their pulse are slow... Still, I don't believe their lives are in danger."
3423,Edelgard: You found Flayn? Where?!
3424,"Ferdinand: You missed the most important part of the mission! We found her within that secret passage. The culprits were the Death Knight and...what was his name? Ah, the Flame Emperor. Sadly, they got away."
3425,"Edelgard: All that matters is Flayn's safety. Right, Professor?"
3426,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Right.
Choice 2: I wanted to catch them.
Edelgard: It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return..."
3427,Choice 1: Right.
3428,"Choice 2: I wanted to catch them.
Edelgard: It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return..."
3429,Edelgard: It is unfortunate. If only you could have waited for me to return...
3430,"Hubert: We will take these two to the infirmary. Professor, please inform Seteth."
3431,"Edelgard: Whatever the circumstance, I'm glad Flayn is safe. Though I'm curious to find out who that other girl is... Huh, Professor? Is that...a smile?"
3432,"Edelgard: Heh, you look...happy. I don't think I've ever seen you like this before. Anyhow, we should hurry to Seteth. He must be beside himself by now."
3433,"Mercedes: Thank goodness. Those girls are pale as ghosts, but at least they're alive. But that Death Knight person...feels so familiar."
3434,Dimitri: You found Flayn?! Thank goodness!
3435,Annette: She was unconscious at the end of that secret passage. We found the culprit too...but he got away.
3436,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No use dwelling on it.
Choice 2: We almost had him."
3437,Choice 1: No use dwelling on it.
3438,Choice 2: We almost had him.
3439,"Dimitri: I'm just grateful that everyone is safe. That's what matters most. I'd like to hear what transpired, but first we need to get these ladies to the infirmary."
3440,Dedue: (bowing) Understood. We'll go at once.
3441,"Dimitri: (sighs) I'm...I'm sorry, Professor. I'm so relieved, I suddenly felt weak. I couldn't be happier with how things turned out. And I imagine no one will be more overjoyed than Seteth. Hm. Hey, Professor. Can you make that expression one more time?"
3442,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Like this? (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: I don't think I've ever seen your face like that.
Choice 2: No.
Choice 3: I don't think I can..."
3443,"Choice 1: Like this? (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: I don't think I've ever seen your face like that."
3444,Dimitri: I don't think I've ever seen your face like that.
3445,Choice 2: No.
3446,Choice 3: I don't think I can...
3447,"Dimitri: Heh, I apologize. I've forgotten myself and come dangerously close to teasing you. It's just...I've never seen you look so happy before. It's downright mesmerizing. Ah, but this isn't the time for idle chitchat. We must hurry and share the good news with Seteth!"
3448,Marianne: They're both alive... Thank goodness.
3449,Claude: You actually found Flayn?! Nice work!
3450,"Lorenz: It is a shame you could not be there, Claude. I would have liked for you to witness our mortal struggle against the Death Knight."
3451,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He got away.
Choice 2: We could not defeat him."
3452,Choice 1: He got away.
3453,Choice 2: We could not defeat him.
3454,"Claude: Hey, at least we managed to rescue Flayn and complete our mission. That's what counts, right? Right! Excellent work, everyone! Now then, let's get these limp ladies to the infirmary, shall we?"
3455,Raphael: No problem. I can carry them both at once.
3456,"Lysithea: Be gentle with them, Raphael! Let us carry each one individually. And slowly."
3457,"Claude: You know, Teach, seeing you smile sure makes me feel better. You look happy for a change. Hm? Do you really not know? Well, truth is, I've never seen you smile before now. At times, it made me wonder whether you were even human. But I suppose that was just my imagination running wild. Anyhow, we've probably kept Seteth waiting about as long as he can stand. Let's hurry up and tell him the great news."
3458,"Seteth: Professor... Please, allow me to express my eternal gratitude once more. Flayn is safe and sound, and I have you to thank for that. Mere words could never express how thankful I am. I...I am indebted to you."
3459,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I couldn't have done it without the students.
Seteth: Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well.
Choice 2: I'm just happy she's safe.
Seteth: Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed."
3460,"Choice 1: I couldn't have done it without the students.
Seteth: Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well."
3461,"Seteth: Yes, of course. I shall express my gratitude to the students as well."
3462,"Choice 2: I'm just happy she's safe.
Seteth: Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed."
3463,"Seteth: Yes, indeed. I...I, too, am overjoyed."
3464,Byleth: But why was Flayn taken to begin with?
3465,"Seteth: Her kidnapper was the masked knight who vanished during the Rite of Rebirth. The one known as the Death Knight. Considering the circumstances, it seems plausible to assume that his true identity is Jeritza. And we cannot forget about the mysterious Flame Emperor... His true motives are yet unclear. However, I have an idea. I believe the enemy may have been after Flayn's blood. The blood that flows through her veins is special. It is extremely rare...and extremely dangerous. If enemies who know the secret of Flayn's blood have appeared, our only option is to leave the monastery and go into hiding."
3466,"Flayn: Brother, wait."
3467,Seteth: Flayn?! What are you doing here? You should be resting!
3468,"Flayn: I do not like the path of your thoughts. I do not wish to live in some lonely, remote location where I never get to see anyone. Not ever again."
3469,"Seteth: If we stay here, you may be targeted again! Wouldn't it be better for the two of us to live in peace?"
3470,"Flayn: Even if we ran off to some new, secret location, there is no guarantee that they would not find us. That is why I believe it would be safest to stay in the monastery, where we are surrounded by capable knights and professors."
3471,"Seteth: I see your point, I do. However..."
3472,Flayn: You know it is the only reasonable option. What if I were to join the professor's class?
3473,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That is a great idea. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!
Choice 2: Why would you do that?
Flayn: Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!"
3474,"Choice 1: That is a great idea. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!"
3475,"Flayn: You think so too? I am so very pleased to hear that! With a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!"
3476,"Choice 2: Why would you do that?
Flayn: Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!"
3477,"Flayn: Because, with a professor like you nearby, I shall be safe no matter what foe should appear!"
3478,"Seteth: I see. I am afraid you have a good point. Professor... Due to my position, I have closely scrutinized everything about you. After all that has happened, I must admit that you are indeed...a trusted ally. So, what say you? Can I entrust you with Flayn's safety?"
3479,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It would be my pleasure. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Choice 2: I suppose I have no choice."
3480,Choice 1: It would be my pleasure. (Relationship with Seteth up)
3481,Choice 2: I suppose I have no choice.
3482,Sothis: I am so glad that Flayn is safe. Yet I can't help but wonder what the story is about the other girl. She wore the uniform of the academy. But who is she?
3483,"Rhea: Well done, Professor. I see that I was right to ask your class for assistance. I have been told that Manuela and Flayn are recovering nicely, as is Monica."

Choice 1: Is Monica a student here?
Choice 2: Who is Monica?"
3485,Choice 1: Is Monica a student here?
3486,Choice 2: Who is Monica?
3487,"Rhea: Monica, the girl you rescued along with Flayn, is also a student at the Officers Academy. However..."
3488,Hanneman: She is a student from last year's class. She went missing just before she would have graduated. It never occurred to us that something might have happened to her at the monastery. We assumed she had run away. I never dreamed that we would find her. Not like this.
3489,"Rhea: Monica has asked to rejoin the Black Eagle House once she has fully recovered. Our enemies are still out there, so we must remain cautious and continue our investigation. However, we must also help the students to move on from this incident."
3490,"Hanneman: After all, the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field next month."
3491,Rhea: Yes. The students will remember it for the rest of their lives. Please guide them so they may show us their best at the coming battle.
3492,"Jeralt: So, you'll be going to Gronder Field next month. You've never been there before, have you? There is unease in the western side of the Empire, but everything east of the capital, Enbarr, is stable. Well, there was a noble rebellion a short while ago, but it didn't amount to much."
3493,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What will you do next month?
Jeralt: I have my own mission. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them.
Choice 2: Will you come to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Jeralt: Sorry, but I've got my own mission, and it's far from Gronder Field. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them."

3497,"Jeralt: Sorry, but I've got my own mission, and it's far from Gronder Field. The church has always been quick to make use of those who work for them."
3498,"Jeralt: What I'm more concerned about is finding out who among us is pulling the strings. Ever since the Rite of Rebirth, strange groups have been seen around Garreg Mach, and elsewhere too. There was also an incident where some knights investigating these suspicious strangers...turned up dead. Not that it's likely, but if something like that ever happens to me... Search this room. Every corner. Behind every shelf. I'm going to leave something for you."
3499,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't say things like that. (Relationship with Jeralt up)
Jeralt: Don't get me wrong. I have no intention of dying. I know it would be too much to ask you to cheer up, but can you at least drop the serious... (laughing) Well, I'll be. Was that a smile just now?
Choice 2: I promise.
Jeralt: Don't just nod solemnly. There's nothing to worry about. I'm just being cautious. Then again, I guess you're always solemn. (laughs)"

3504,"From on high, flocks of wyverns roar in chorus and soar the pristine skies, heading south for the winter. Fódlan's children lend their hands to winter preparations by gathering firewood and catching fish from the rivers' cool waters. Yet all the while their gazes are turned skyward, drawn to the magnificent sight above.

3585,"Edelgard: Professor, you already know about the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, correct?"
3586,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Only the name.
Choice 2: I can't recall. (Relationship with Edelgard down)"
3587,Choice 1: Only the name.
3588,Choice 2: I can't recall. (Relationship with Edelgard down)
3589,"Edelgard: I see. In that case, allow me to fill you in. It's a large-scale mock battle between the rival houses that takes place every year."
3590,Hubert: Its scale is incomparable to the mock battle we fought during the Great Tree Moon. It will take place in the vast Gronder Field. That is in Empire territory to the southeast of Garreg Mach.
3591,"Edelgard: Whichever house defeats the most opponents wins. Of course, the professors also fight alongside their respective houses."
3592,"Hubert: Well, usually. Professor Manuela is being prudent. She will not be participating this year. Since his long-time rival will be absent, Professor Hanneman has also declined."
3593,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In that case, I must sit out too. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Choice 2: What should I do?"
3594,"Choice 1: In that case, I must sit out too. (Relationship with Manuela up)"
3595,Choice 2: What should I do?
3596,"Manuela: Oh, don't worry about us. You know you wanna see the kids in action."
3597,"Hubert: Are you feeling any better, Professor Manuela?"
3598,"Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway."
3599,"Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all."
3600,Manuela: Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.
3601,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If I'm the only professor present... (Relationship with Manuela down)
Choice 2: This doesn't seem fair... (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Manuela: Oh my, look at you. If you're as confident as all that, my students will walk all over you."

3605,Hanneman: We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!
3606,"Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is finally upon us! This is our chance to show off the results of your expert training, Professor."
3607,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Battle of the Eagle and Lion?
Dimitri: Have Lady Rhea and Seteth really not filled you in? Well, if that's the case, I'm happy to explain.

3611,"Dimitri: Haha, I highly doubt that. If you don't mind, I'd be happy to explain."
3612,Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion takes place every year during the Wyvern Moon. It can best be described as a mock battle between the three houses.
3613,"Dedue: Much like the one we had during the Great Tree Moon. Do you remember, Professor?"
3614,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes, I remember.
Choice 2: I remember our celebration most of all. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: It was certainly an unforgettable time. I've never seen anyone put away as much victory food as you did that night, Professor!"

3618,"Dimitri: This battle will take place in Empire territory, at Gronder Field. In other words, far removed from the monastery. It's a mock battle between the three houses. The house that defeats the most opponents wins."
3619,"Dedue: Your Highness, if the rumors are true, I believe Professor Manuela and Professor Hanneman will not be joining us."
3620,"Dimitri: Ah, yes, right you are. Given recent events, Professor Manuela has opted to sit this one out. Since she won't be present, Professor Hanneman has decided to skip this year as well."
3621,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In that case, I must sit out too. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Choice 2: What should I do?"
3622,"Choice 1: In that case, I must sit out too. (Relationship with Manuela up)"

3626,"Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway."
3627,"Dedue: In that case, perhaps it is best that you sit this one out."
3628,"Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all."
3629,Manuela: Well put. We've spent the past few months pushing our students to their limits. You can see me in the infirmary after they destroy you.

Claude: You're kidding! Come on, Teach, I need you to keep it together for me. Don't lose focus when it counts.
Choice 2: I know little about it.
Claude: You're kidding! Didn't Rhea or Seteth fill you in? Guess I have to do everything myself around here."

3641,Claude: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is one of the academy's annual traditions. It's a huge mock battle between the three rival houses.
3642,"Hilda: But you know all about rivalry battles, Professor. There was one right after you got here, remember? I hear the Battle of the Eagle and Lion will be held in Gronder Field, far away from Garreg Mach."
3643,"Claude: The house that defeats most opponents wins. It's a three-way battle that relies heavily on strategy. Sounds exciting, doesn't it?"
3644,"Hilda: Hey Claude, what about Professor Manuela? Do you think she'll be able to join us despite her injuries?"
3645,"Claude: I'm afraid she's sitting this one out, as is Professor Hanneman. (mimicking Professor Hanneman) ""As my persistent rival will not be present, it only goes to follow that I must also sit out this year's battle. Now leave me be, Claude!"""

3651,"Manuela: Thanks to all of you. But I'd only be a burden out there. My students don't need to see me collapsed. Well, not on the battlefield, anyway."
3652,Hilda: Does that mean you really won't be joining us for the battle?
3653,"Hanneman: Correct, we will not be participating. Regardless, do not expect victory to come easily. Or at all."

3659,Hanneman: We have taught our students well. There is no need to hold back. Challenge them with everything you have!
3660,"Sothis: Hmph. This monastery is more dangerous than I expected. It's likely that our foes have infiltrated the ranks of the teachers... And there may be others of questionable character about as well! If you ask me, there is something amiss about that old man...Tomas."
3661,"Monica: What do you say, Edel? Shall we meet up in the library later to... Oh! Hello, Professor!"
3662,Edelgard: Do you need something? I'm a little busy at the moment.
3663,"Monica: Sorry, Professor! I've got a lot of questions to ask Edel here. Since I couldn't graduate last year, I really want to make sure I can do so this year."
3664,Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion... Its name comes from the war in which the Kingdom won its independence from the Empire. It's imperative that we fight our best. We must live up to the legacy of the King of Lions.
3665,"Dimitri: Flayn and...Monica, was it? I'm glad they were returned safe and sound."
3666,"Claude: Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing. Everyone else seems to be raring to go too. We're all looking to you to guide us, Teach."
3667,Claude: Going all the way to the Empire for a mock battle? This is serious business. And there's a reward to be had as well. I'd really like to win this thing.
3668,"Claude: Seteth, that stubborn goat. Holding a fishing tournament now? Just last month he looked like death warmed over."
3669,"Hubert: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is a free-for-all contest among the three classes. If you are victorious, the archbishop will no doubt present you with a reward."

3674,"Ferdinand: You know, the Empire used to control all of Fódlan. But after the civil war, the northern region split off and became the Kingdom. Later, the eastern part of the Kingdom seceded to become the Alliance. There are three powers today, but a thousand years ago, we were all united as one. Even now, among the nobles of the Empire, there are some who dream of reunifying Fódlan..."
3675,"Linhardt: I'm just absolutely exhausted. I swear to you, Professor, every month we're worked harder than the month before. I had imagined the academy as a chance to possibly relax before our lives began in earnest."
3676,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You came to the academy to relax?
Linhardt: After graduating, we'll enter into noble society, which mean contending with all the intrigues and dramas that entails. I want to just...postpone life for a bit. Fish... Nap under a tree... Skip out on lectures and– Well, not on your lectures of course, Professor.
Choice 2: It is what it is. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Agreed. That's the Church of Seiros for you. What is it they say? ""Those with power are obliged to use it."""

3688,"Dorothea: Fishing? No thanks. I tried it once, and...ugh. Gross. I don't even really like to eat fish, let alone catch and gut them. Besides, who can think about fishing right now? The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is coming up soon. Feeling confident?"

3698,Dedue: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion draws near. His Highness insists upon training well into the night. He has said it is nothing to worry about. But how could I not be concerned?
3699,Dedue: Did you want something?
3700,"Dedue: Ever since the tournament, the kitchen is completely overtaken with fish. The cooks cannot keep up."
3701,"Felix: I'm not interested in glory or prizes. All I want is a formidable enemy to sink my teeth into. As far as I can see, there are only a couple of opponents worth my time."
3702,"Felix: Since we were little, Ingrid's always gotten this odd look in her eye when someone brings up food."
3703,"Ashe: You know, I'm pretty good at fishing. My older brother used to take me out. Why don't you give it a try too? They say we can eat whatever we catch!"
3704,"Sylvain: A fishing tournament, huh? Sounds fun, but not as fun as reeling in the ladies. Heh! Just kidding, of course. The most important thing right now is preparing for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. After all, the ladies love nothing more than a winner. And around here, there's no bigger game."
3705,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's the wrong reason to compete.
Sylvain: Everyone has their own reasons to fight. At least I'm honest about mine.

3707,Sylvain: Everyone has their own reasons to fight. At least I'm honest about mine.
3708,"Choice 2: I'm sure they do. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: I knew you'd understand, Professor."
3709,"Sylvain: I knew you'd understand, Professor."
3710,Mercedes: Hmm... Ah! I'm so sorry! I was lost in thought.
3711,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You seem a bit down. (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: It's very kind of you to be concerned, but I promise that I'm fine. I was just thinking... The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?
Choice 2: What were you thinking about?
Mercedes: The Death Knight's true identity. Could it actually be Professor Jeritza?"

3716,"Annette: Gronder Field is in the Empire, right? I wonder how we'll get there. I thought I heard that there's no path that goes straight from the monastery to the Empire... Oh! Perhaps we'll travel through Alliance territory. Yes, I see, from the east, we would go...hm, there! Ah, yes, that must be it!"
3717,Ingrid: Holding such a frivolous and downright ridiculous event so close to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... It's absolutely absurd. Although...they did say we could eat whatever we catch. I'm a sucker for a good meal...I just couldn't resist.
3718,"Lorenz: I received a rare letter from my father recently. He said that he is praying for the Golden Deer House to emerge victorious. Insistently praying. My father attended the Officers Academy, and won a glorious victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. I think he is quite proud of that, even to this day. I suppose that shows how great an honor it truly is."
3719,"Raphael: Hey, Professor! Did you hear about the fishing tournament? You get to fish in the pond as much as you want. The more you catch, the more you get to eat!"
3720,Ignatz: Sometimes it's nice to dangle a fishing line and let your mind wander. I'd love to spend some time lounging around by a scenic river or lake.
3721,"Lysithea: Why would we go all the way to Gronder Field? It's idiocy to travel that far. It may be a tradition, but it takes forever to get there and is exhausting. So pointless. I guess there's nothing to be done about it. Even by you, Professor."
3722,"Marianne: Excuse me, Professor. Um, do you think it would reflect poorly on me if I chose not to take part in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion?"
3723,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes, it would.
Marianne: Oh, I see...
Choice 2: Don't you want to participate? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: Well, I don't really want to leave the monastery..."

3728,"Marianne: I'm not very confident, but I'll try my best."
3729,"Hilda: Professor, do you have a second? It's about Monica. Does she seem...off to you? She was imprisoned for a long time, but she seems to have recovered almost instantly, and she's been bizarrely cheerful."
3730,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Now that you mention it... (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: You see what I mean? I wonder if she's straining to seem happy, just to make people comfortable.
Choice 2: She's moving on. Isn't that a good thing?
Hilda: I guess you're right. It just seems fast, doesn't it?"
3731,"Choice 1: Now that you mention it... (Relationship with Hilda up)

3735,Hilda: Hmm... And why is she so close to Edelgard anyway?
3736,"Leonie: Why are they having a fishing tournament now? Are they just giving up on the battle of the Eagle and Lion?! You're not condoning this, right? Are you?!"
3737,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes, I'm taking part.
Leonie: What?! If you've got all this free time, shouldn't you be spending it on your students?
Choice 2: No, I'm not taking part. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: Good. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action. I hope Captain Jeralt will be watching."
3738,"Choice 1: Yes, I'm taking part.

3741,Leonie: Good. I'm looking forward to seeing you in action. I hope Captain Jeralt will be watching.
3742,Rhea: The situation last month was dire indeed. The students endured great hardship. I hope you are able to put all of that behind you so that you may focus on this month's assignment.
3743,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course.
Rhea: A most reassuring response. I trust that your class is in good hands.
Choice 2: It will be difficult. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: That is to be expected. I, too, cannot quite shake that feeling of unease. Even so, we must both strive to put that nasty business behind us."
3744,"Choice 1: Of course.

3749,Seteth: I have something to ask of you.
3750,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What is it?
Choice 2: Leave it to me. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine."
3751,Choice 1: What is it?
3752,"Choice 2: Leave it to me. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine."
3753,"Seteth: I have not even told you what my request is yet! Well, fine."
3754,"Seteth: Flayn has been through an awful lot this past month. To make up for that, I have decided to give her whatever she wants. I asked her what she would like, and she expressed a desire for a feast of fish. Since I'm sure the students would be interested, I have decided to hold a fishing tournament here at the monastery. I have left all of the specifics to Shamir. Please, enter and put in your best effort."
3755,Seteth: I hear that you participated in the fishing tournament. I appreciate you taking the time.
3756,"Flayn: I told my brother I had a craving for some tasty fish. I did not realize when I did that it would turn into...well, this. My apologies."
3757,"Alois: I'm going to catch me some mighty fish, just you wait and see! Er, but they haven't been biting..."
3758,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Your shouting is scaring the fish. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: What shouting? Everyone told me I was too loud, so I've been using my quiet voice.
Choice 2: Maybe the fish are frightened by you. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: I didn't think of that. Ah, the truth is right in front of me... (laughs) Just kidding. As though a fish is smart enough to be afraid of me."

3763,"Catherine: Can you believe what Seteth said? ""Catch some tasty fish for Flayn."" I'm her bodyguard!"
3764,Shamir: Welcome to the monastery fishing tournament. You look confused. Didn't Seteth tell you about it? Just catch whatever fish Flayn requests. Show any fish you catch to Flayn.
3765,"Shamir: The fishing tournament is over. I heard you did some fishing, and that Flayn is happy."
3766,"Gilbert: Professor, has Seteth told you? We're to have a fishing tournament. Given the events of the last month, I believe this is just the sort of distraction we need, staff and student alike."
3767,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Will you take part?
Gilbert: I'm afraid I am not one for festivities. I do enjoy a spot of fishing, though.

3771,"Gilbert: I do enjoy the sport, yet I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at it."
3772,Gilbert: I believe it best that I stick to quietly fishing by myself.
3773,"Jeralt: The recent happenings at the monastery... There is something going on behind the scenes here. I've been commissioned to investigate as well. As I've already mentioned, this month I'm off to the Kingdom. You be on your guard, OK?"
3774,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm not worried.
Jeralt: Well, I hope you're right.
Choice 2: I'm more worried about you than myself.
Jeralt: (laughs) Perhaps I've gotten into your head too much! I won't go dying on you. I've stayed alive this long, after all."

3779,"Jeralt: How are preparations for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion going? Hm? Fishing? Taking it easy, are you?"
3780,"Hanneman: I don' t know if you've heard, but Flayn is very special. Her blood carries a rare Crest... Oh, the lengths to which she could advance my research, if only I was allowed to study her! If only it weren't for Seteth's strict orders! He protects his sister with unusual zeal."
3781,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should give up. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: I dislike it, but I agree. The time I would spend begging him and accomplishing nothing would be better spent on other research.
Choice 2: Maybe you can convince him.
Hanneman: Have you ever tried convincing Seteth of anything? I'm not sure I could convince the man the sky is blue if he hadn't already looked up for himself."

3786,"Manuela: I always thought I was pretty good, you know? Then I go and get stabbed. Ugh... But my opponent was the Death Knight, so I figure I did pretty well to only get stabbed. I wonder if it's true that he is actually Jeritza... Whoever he is...I'm going to make him pay. It turns out that when I get stabbed, I get really mad!"
3787,"Byleth:

3791,"Tomas: When you feel that first refreshing breeze upon your face, you know it is almost time for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Gronder Field is within the Empire, but the path there from the monastery necessitates passing through Alliance territory. Fódlan's biggest river, the Airmid River, flows along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. You will have to cross one of the largest bridges upon that river, the Great Bridge of Myrddin."
3792,"Cyril: Fódlan is big. It's not as big as Almyra is, but it's still pretty big."
3793,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you want to travel around Fódlan someday? (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Travel? I don't know... Never thought about it, I guess.

3798,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Young Monica disappeared last year. I thought she had simply run along home. But it turns out she was kidnapped! I can't believe it. How awful it must have been for the poor thing. They say her personality is completely changed, but at least she seems more cheerful than before. Grateful to be alive, perhaps?"
3799,"Knight of Seiros: Along with Flayn, we found another female student who went missing last year. But now the combat professor, Jeritza, has vanished. His origin begged many questions, so there were plenty of objections to his appointment here. He is apparently from House Hrym of the Empire, but he was adopted from another family. Or so they say... Anyway, there hasn't been much good to be said about House Hrym in recent decades."
3800,"Squire: The Death Knight's true identity... Personally, I don't think it could be Jeritza. He taught me swordsmanship... He said I had talent and the potential to get pretty strong. He was a little scary, of course...but it's hard for me to believe he's a bad person."
3801,"Student: Having a fishing tournament before the Battle of the Eagle and Lion... At first I couldn't figure out what they were thinking. But the fish are especially tasty this time of year, so I don't question it anymore! Have you had any, Professor? You'd better eat up before it's all gone!"
3802,"Student: Oh, hi, Professor. Have you heard the rumor about the Goddess Tower? Well, there's an annual ball here the month after next, during the Ethereal Moon. They say if a boy and a girl wish for something together at the Goddess Tower on that night, the goddess herself will grant it! I don't know where the rumor started, but it's a great story, isn't it?"
3803,"Monk: After the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, a prize is awarded to the winner by the archbishop herself. It's a three-way battle, so you can't waste too much time just observing. You have to jump right in there. You have to be proactive and defeat the most opponents. Do that, and it's quite possible the archbishop will recognize how strong you are. Ah... Great memories. I was a student here many years ago. I know what I speak of."
3804,"Monk: Ah, I see. So you are Jeralt's child. You so resemble your mother."
3805,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Did you know my mother?

3811,"Yuri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is almost here. Time certainly is strange. All this really has me feeling nostalgic. Back when I was in the academy, I took part in the battle too."

Choice 1: Which class were you in?
Yuri: The Blue Lions. Back then, I was living with Kingdom nobility as an adoptee.

3818,"Balthus: Hey, pal. This month is the big brawl, yeah? Yeah! It's the Battle of Eagle and Lion! I hear I'm free to join in. My heart's full to bursting! My muscles too, but that's pretty normal for me. This is big, pal. The Legendary King of Grappling's triumphant return. The other houses won't know what hit 'em!"
3819,"Balthus: Hey, pal. The surface brats have that big brawl this month, yeah? The Battle of the Eagle and Lion? The Golden Deer lost that one back in my day. Hope they win this year! Ha! Got ya! I'll be cheering for your house this time. Not like I have anything better to do."
3820,"Constance: That young lady, Monica...might she be Baron Ochs's daughter? We're not acquainted, but I have heard tell that the baron has a daughter roughly her age. Despite my current circumstances, I was born into House Nuvelle, one of the preeminent houses of the Empire. Didn't you know? There isn't much of my house left to speak of, but mark my words, someday it shall return in glory!"
3821,"Hapi: By the by, do I have to participate in this Eagle and Lion thing this month? Gotcha. Well, I hope we win. You won't like what happens if I'm on the losing team."
3822,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. You're wondering where Mr. Backup is, aren't you? Figured you'd want an update. Or report, if you will. He's gone. Other duties or some such nonsense. But he'll be back, right? I bet so... I think he liked this place? Especially the company... We really had something... Hm, he'll miss it. Just wait and see."
3823,"Resident: When the nobles came for me, they were completely without mercy. They... They killed everyone. My parents. My husband. My son. They all died...for nothing. For being in the way. People with Crests do whatever they want. No one even tries to stop them. Especially not the church..."
3824,"Elderly Man: Hey, come join me over here. For once, we're got plenty of food! Hahaha! Folks up above caught up so many fish that we've got a bunch more down here than usual. It's not too common to get a big fishing haul down here in Abyss!"
3825,"Shamir: Welcome to the fishing tournament. If you catch the type of fish that Flayn asks for, you might win a prize. Participate if you want. It's really not my concern."
3826,"Flayn: Will you be taking part too, Professor? Ah, I must admit, I am quite excited! I cannot recall the type of fish I was hoping to dine on... So, if you do manage to catch a fish, do you mind bringing it for me to see?"
3827,"Flayn: Oh, you caught one!"
3828,Flayn: What a shame. It is not the type I was hoping for.
3829,"Flayn: Yes, yes! Yay! This is it! This is the fish I have been pining for! I am so pleased! I shall cook it up immediately!"
3830,Gave Teutates Herring x1
3831,"Ashe: Oh, so you're taking part. How would you feel about a little friendly competition? Catch the same kind of fish as me and we'll compare the two. Biggest wins!"
3832,Ashe: Looks like you've been doing some fishing. Let's see what you've got.
3833,"Ashe: Wow, that's a spectacular fish! You win. I can't compete with that."

3838,"Ignatz: Aw, I lost. Is there anything you can't do?"
3839,Gained Vulnerary x1
3840,Ignatz: I think that's the end of the fishing tournament. I suppose it's time to prepare for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!
3841,"Ingrid: Are you taking part as well? Why don't we have some fun with this? A little contest. If you catch a fish like this, come show it to me. Whoever catches the bigger fish will be the victor."
3842,"Ingrid: So, you've caught something, have you? Let us pit our fish against each other."
3843,"Ingrid: Alas, your fish is clearly grander than mine... I suppose you win. This time."
3844,Gained Tomato x1

3846,Raphael: Oh! You're entering too? Then how about a little friendly competition? Let's see who can catch the biggest fish! There's no way I'll lose!
3847,Raphael: Did you catch something? Let's see what you got!
3848,Raphael: No way! That fish looks bigger and tastier! I can't believe I lost...
3849,Gained Wild Game x1
3850,"Raphael: The fishing tournament's over already? Guess it's time for my personal eating tournament, then. Best part is...no losers!"
3851,"Caspar: So, you are joining the fishing tournament? That's great! But you don't stand a chance against me! I just caught this beauty! I bet you can't catch a bigger one of the same kind."

3853,"Caspar: I...I lost? But how? Ugh! I guess I underestimated you, Professor."
3854,Gained Iron Axe x1
3855,"Caspar: I wasn't expecting much, but this tournament was a lot of fun."
3856,Petra: I am happy that you will have participation. Maybe you and I both can have a small contest with each other? We will both have catching of the same fish type and do comparisons. Whoever has the fish with the biggest size will be winning. OK?
3857,Petra: Show me the fish so we can see whose has the biggest size. I will have comparisons now.
3858,"Petra: Your fish has way more size. I have had losing... I mean, I have lost."
3859,Gained Iron Sword x1
3860,Petra: This created more fun than I have experienced in a long time. Did you also have the fun?
3861,Catherine: Have you thought about entering? Maybe you and I could have a little friendly competition. I just caught this fish here. Why don't you try catching a bigger one of the same type?

3866,"Shamir: The fishing tournament is over. Flayn seemed overjoyed, and I'm certain that pleased Seteth as well."
3867,"Soldier: The knights of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus are seeking someone to train with. Kingdom knights are certainly tough, but I bet you could keep up."
3868,"Soldier: It was just a training exercise, but still, that was an astounding victory. The Kingdom knights were so impressed that they agreed to pitch in and help at the monastery."
3869,"Soldier: Some bandits are making trouble in a nearby village. Normally we would assist, but right now we have our hands full with this Lord Lonato business. So many to help, so little time. What do we do?"
3870,"Soldier: So, you saved the village from bandits. Now that we've had this learning experience, vigilante groups have popped up across the land. Hopefully this will help protect the peace."
3871,"Student: Would you mind delivering this letter on my behalf? To whom, you ask? Well, he's gallant, he has a charming smile, and he always puts his family first."
3872,Student: Thank you! I watched Alois as he read the letter... I think he looked happy about it! Keechee!
3873,Monk: Do you mind terribly picking up some fresh flowers to place upon your mother's grave? I am certain she'd be deeply moved to receive a gift from you.
3874,"Monk: Thank you so much. This is just the type of flower she once loved so dearly. I can rest easy now. I must be off. Take especially good care of yourself, won't you? Please, look after Jeralt. She'd have wanted that."
3875,"Anna: It seems that there are some rare, valuable secrets circulating on the battlefield. I'd like you to collect a number of these for me, should you have an opportunity to do so."
3876,"Anna: Ah, you've collected some trade secrets for me! I really, really appreciate it! I'll just take them... Hehehe, perfect... What? Nothing! Just talking to myself. See you later!"
3877,Caspar: Gronder Field is in the Empire. It's actually part of my family's territory - House Bergliez. It is the largest field in all of Fódlan. The grain it produces sustains the whole Empire. Wait... I sure hope we don't destroy all that grain.
3878,Hubert: It is considered the most suitable place for a large-scale battle.
3879,"Edelgard: Professor, if it were up to you, how would you approach this battle?"
3880,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I would fight them head-on. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Choice 2: I would surprise them with clever schemes. (Relationship with Hubert up)"
3881,Choice 1: I would fight them head-on. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
3882,Choice 2: I would surprise them with clever schemes. (Relationship with Hubert up)
3883,"Edelgard: That sounds like a certain someone we both know. But as you wish. We'll use whatever strategy you think is best. If the Black Eagle House bands together, we won't lose."
3884,"Hubert: Our strength is superior. So if we do lose, it would be on your shoulders, Professor."
3885,"Ferdinand: If you're not confident you can do this, just sit back and leave it to me."
3886,Hubert: (chuckles) The most you will do is make things worse. You'll just get in Lady Edelgard's way.
3887,"Caspar: Are you two about to fight? Haha! Count me in! Wait, no. I think we all need to calm down."
3888,Petra: We have no lack of opponents. I am ready to go hunting for our enemies!
3889,"Dorothea: Hunting isn't exactly... Well, I guess they're pretty similar, actually."
3890,"Bernadetta: I'm just gonna hide in the fort and cheer everyone on. There, um, is a fort, right?"
3891,"Linhardt: Sure, but it's deep in enemy territory. How kind of you to offer to cut through for us."
3892,"Bernadetta: What?! No! That's not what I meant! Ugh, good work Bernie..."
3893,"Linhardt: This will be your first battle, won't it, Flayn? You don't seem nervous at all."
3894,"Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!"
3895,Edelgard: Our battle will begin shortly. The flag of the Black Eagles will soon grace Gronder Field!
3896,"Dimitri: So, this is to be our battlefield...Gronder Field. Are you feeling confident, Professor?"
3897,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Very. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Excellent. That's most reassuring.
Choice 2: I'm not so sure. (Relationship with Dimitri down)
Dimitri: We've seen your power firsthand, so we know better than anyone what you're capable of. Beyond that, we believe in you. If it's not too big a burden, I ask that you believe in us as well."
3898,"Choice 1: Very. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Excellent. That's most reassuring."
3899,Dimitri: Excellent. That's most reassuring.

3901,"Dimitri: We've seen your power firsthand, so we know better than anyone what you're capable of. Beyond that, we believe in you. If it's not too big a burden, I ask that you believe in us as well."
3902,"Dimitri: We can win. I'm sure of it. After all, it's not as though we've spent the last half-year sitting idle. And I'm feeling stronger this moon. As though I could conquer a thousand opponents all on my own."
3903,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's reassuring. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: You can depend on me. I hope you know that.
Choice 2: Don't get carried away...
Dimitri: I'm only joking, of course... But perhaps it isn't a laughing matter. I beg your forgiveness. I must practice levity so that I can provide a more enjoyable joke when the opportunity next presents itself. After all, I hear that telling jokes is a good way to calm the nerves before heading into battle. Still...I find it quite difficult."
3904,"Choice 1: That's reassuring. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: You can depend on me. I hope you know that."
3905,Dimitri: You can depend on me. I hope you know that.

3908,"Dimitri: Well, it's about time for the battle to begin. Everyone, brace yourselves."
3909,Felix: Hmph. All I'm worried about is finding someone worthy to cross swords with.
3910,"Mercedes: We've prepared and trained a great deal. We should be fine, right?"
3911,"Annette: You're always so carefree, Mercie! Don't forget we need to try our hardest out there so we can win!"
3912,Ashe: This is our chance to show how hard we've been working! Let's do our best.
3913,"Sylvain: If I emerge victorious in the lauded Battle of the Eagle and Lion, the ladies are sure to take notice. I'll have to go into hiding."
3914,"Ingrid: Ugh, is that all you think about? Actually, as long as you try your hardest, frame it however you like."
3915,"Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!"
3916,"Dedue: No matter the battle, I will never falter."
3917,"Dimitri: We're counting on your guidance, Professor. Let's show the world what the Blue Lions are made of!"
3918,"Claude: So this is Gronder Field... Hey, Teach. Not a bad place to wage war, is it?"
3919,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How so?
Choice 2: Absolutely. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: I knew you'd understand."
3920,Choice 1: How so?
3921,"Choice 2: Absolutely. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: I knew you'd understand."
3922,Claude: I knew you'd understand.
3923,"Claude: Plenty of places to hide, and our pick of paths to advance through. It's the perfect battlefield for our tactics. I have my eye on that low hill over there. See it? It's the ideal spot to lure our enemies to, and then surround them with fire."
3924,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's risky.
Choice 2: Fire is unacceptable."
3925,Choice 1: It's risky.
3926,Choice 2: Fire is unacceptable.
3927,"Claude: Gotcha, Teach! I know, I know. We want all students to make it back to the monastery. With you in command, we can't lose. The Imperial princess and the crown prince don't stand a chance."
3928,Hilda: Professor! Claude! What are you two talking about?
3929,Lorenz: What do you expect? It's Claude. I expect he was foisting more of his ill-advised schemes on our poor professor.
3930,"Claude: Oh, you have me all figured out, Lorenz. You know me better than I know myself."
3931,"Ignatz: Win or lose, it's an honor just to participate in the legendary Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
3932,Leonie: We've got to win so we can show Captain Jeralt what we're made of!
3933,Raphael: Yes! I'm ready! Let's go!
3934,"Flayn: Haha, I shall give it my all!"
3935,Marianne: I'll just...stay quiet and follow along so I don't get in anyone's way.
3936,"Lysithea: That will not be acceptable, Marianne. The whole point of this exercise is for each house to act as one."
3937,Hilda: Do your best! I can't wait to see how well everyone does.
3938,"Claude: All right, sounds like Hilda will be taking control of a central hill and watching the battle from there."
3939,"Claude: It's almost time. Come on, Teach! The battle starts now!"
3940,Dimitri: You all should know... I am not about to go easy on you today.
3941,"Claude: As long as we can pull off the win, it doesn't matter how."
3942,Edelgard: Our victory must be absolute...no matter what it may take.
3943,Seteth: It is time.
3944,Edelgard: Forward! now!
3945,Dimitri: For honor!

3952,"Dimitri: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion is set to begin at long last. Everyone, show off the results of your dedicated training!"
3953,"Claude: Remember, we're not just fighting for honor. There's a prize at stake!"
3954,"Edelgard: It's almost time to begin. Steel yourselves, everyone."
3955,Claude: The Black Eagles and Blue Lions are fighting... Maybe we can sneak right past them.
3956,Lorenz: A stronghold for me to seize? Splendid!
3957,"Claude: There goes Lorenz, acting on his own... Guess we've got no choice but to capture the central hill and cover him!"
3958,"Dimitri: This could be our chance! Dedue, cut through the Golden Deer!"
3959,"(If Ingrid was not recruited)
Dimitri: Ingrid, make use of your mobility—circle back behind the Black Eagles!"

3971,Dimitri: The Black Eagles and the Golden Deer are already in battle? We should take this chance to break through the Black Eagle's flank.
3972,"Dedue: I will draw the Black Eagles out, Your Highness."
3973,"Dimitri: Yes, and while you are doing so, we will take control of the central hill."
3974,"Edelgard: If you intend to act, do it now. Hubert! Head toward the Blue Lions!"

3980,Byleth: ...
3981,"Edelgard: What? I was just trying to rally your spirits. Now, to victory!"
3982,Claude: Hey Princess! Heads up! There's a rat right by your Imperial feet...
3983,Edelgard: BAH! I—Huh. How dare you make a fool of me. You will not rile me with such childish tactics.
3984,"Claude: Ah, so the sheer terror in your eyes was... something else entirely. My mistake. Anyway, it was only a joke."
3985,Edelgard: You really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes? It won't work. You must stand and fight!
3986,"Dimitri: So, it is time to cross blades... I never imagined such a day would come to pass."
3987,"Edelgard: If the Empire and the Kingdom go to war, we'll be able to fight as much as we please."
3988,"Dimitri: I am sorry, but that is not something to joke about. The thought of fighting you is troubling at best."
3989,"Edelgard: In that case, I wonder when you'll be able to stomach facing me in battle... Do you need a few moments?"
3990,"(If other Black Eagle units are active)
Edelgard: I'm sorry, but I must retreat... You should have no trouble winning. Don't give up!"
3991,"Edelgard: I'm sorry, but I must retreat... You should have no trouble winning. Don't give up!"
3992,"(if Edelgard is the last Black Eagle unit defeated)
Edelgard: I hate to admit it...but it seems this is as far as the Black Eagle House goes."
3993,Edelgard: I hate to admit it...but it seems this is as far as the Black Eagle House goes.
3994,Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Black Eagles!
3995,"Edelgard: Thank you for your hard work, everyone! I daresay that prize is as good as ours."
3996,"Claude: This is a great chance for me to find out if the Sword of the Creator really is all it's cracked up to be. On that note, you'd better not surrender too quickly!"
3997,Claude: Hey Princess! Heads up! There's a rat right by your Imperial feet...
3998,Edelgard: BAH! I—Huh. How dare you make a fool of me. You will not rile me with such childish tactics.
3999,"Claude: Ah, so the sheer terror in your eyes was... something else entirely. My mistake. Anyway, it was only a joke."
4000,Edelgard: You really hope to unsettle me with childish jokes? It won't work. You must stand and fight!
4001,"Claude: Hey, Your Royalness! If you promise to let me have the prize, I'll let you take the honor of victory. Do we have a deal?"
4002,"Dimitri: Enough of your foolishness! I– Wait a moment. You are trying to anger me, is that it?"
4003,"Claude: Saw right through me, did you? Well, if there's no deal, I'll just have to win this thing fair and square!"
4004,"Dimitri: I will happily face you, here and now. Do not hold back, Claude!"
4005,"(If other Golden Deer units are active)
Claude: Sorry, but it's about time I make my exit… The rest of you...please, finish the job!"

4009,Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are… The Golden Deer!
4010,"Claude: A victory worthy of a feast! We did so well, there's no way we didn't secure that prize."
4011,"Dimitri: How far can I push myself with you as my foe... This will be a great chance to test our mettle. Do not underestimate me, Professor, or you will fail!"
4012,"Claude: Hey, Your Royalness! If you promise to let me have the prize, I'll let you take the honor of victory. Do we have a deal?"

Dimitri: I suppose my training wasn't enough… The Blue Lions have no choice but to retreat."

4024,Seteth: That is the end of this year's Battle of the Eagle and Lion! And the winners are... The Blue Lions!
4025,"Dimitri: We won! And judging by our performance, I'm certain we have earned the prize as well."
4026,Dimitri: Edelgard. Professor. That was a spectacular battle. You both fought exceptionally well.
4027,Claude: Complete and utter defeat... I would hate to make an enemy of you two.
4028,"Edelgard: No need to get carried away with praise. I know you both feel we won by a paper-thin margin. And I won't deny it. If we were to fight again, there's no telling who would prevail. What do you think, Professor?"
4029,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Blue Lion House was very strong. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: I am honored to hear you say that. Still, I must continue to train rigorously.
Choice 2: The Golden Deer House was very strong. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: I'm honored! And I'll level with you - I think that margin is at least as wide as two sheets of paper. I mean that.
Choice 3: They were nothing. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: Professor?! Well, I suppose it's OK to let victory go to your head just this once."
4030,"Choice 1: The Blue Lion House was very strong. (Relationship with Dimitri up)

4036,"Claude: In any case, I hope the day never comes when we have to put this experience to use."
4037,Dimitri: Agreed. I would hate to know a future in which I'm forced to cross swords with you.
4038,Edelgard: True. Although the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was originally named after a war between the Empire and the Kingdom. But that's all in the past. I'm sure even the name will one day fade from the pages of history.
4039,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I hope so.

4040,Choice 1: I hope so.
4041,Choice 2: Let's do our best to get along.
4042,"Claude: How admirable, Teach! On that note, I have a proposition. When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a ""grand"" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall."
4043,Dimitri: It would be a fine opportunity to know each other better. Count me in.
4044,"Edelgard: So be it. Let's plan to meet up on the night we return. Is that OK with you, Professor?"
4045,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm looking forward to it.

4048,Edelgard: What's gotten into you today? I'm not used to seeing you this excited.
4049,Edelgard: (to Byleth) Seeing such a big smile on your face is a rare gift... It makes me feel like I can maybe relax a little too.
4050,"Claude: Well done, Your Princeliness. I'm certainly not in any hurry to get on your bad side."
4051,"Edelgard: I assumed you would attack us head-on. I clearly need to rethink my opinion of you. Well done, Dimitri."
4052,"Dimitri: You both deserve equal praise for a battle well fought. All three houses did extremely well. Don't you agree, Professor?"
4053,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Black Eagle House was very strong. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: Not strong enough, clearly. If there's ever a next time, know that I plan to wipe that smile from your face.
Choice 2: The Golden Deer House was very strong. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: It's an honor to hear that from a fighter such as yourself! But there's no getting around it. The Blue Lions were better prepared.
Choice 3: They were nothing. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: It only seemed that way because of the caliber of your command. Even now, we must not allow ourselves to become complacent."

4061,"Edelgard: I wouldn't mind. I'll accept a challenge from either of you at any time. Heh, I'm kidding, of course!"
4062,"Dimitri: That is nothing to joke about. The true Battle of the Eagle and Lion is best left in the past. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually change the name of this mock battle."

4073,Dimitri: You look so...happy. I love seeing you like this. I suppose that look on your face is just another boon from this glorious day. Perhaps the best one of all.
4074,"Edelgard: Well done, Claude. I see your schemes are not to be underestimated."
4075,"Dimitri: Yes, I must wholeheartedly agree. As ever, I have proven to be no match for you."
4076,"Claude: It is the utmost honor to receive praise from your royal– (laughs) I'm kidding, of course. Really, though, I was lucky to have Teach on my side. In all honesty, you two made me work for it. If I had to face you again, there's no telling which way it would go. What do you think, Teach? How did the other houses fare?"

4087,"Claude: Well, now that the three-way battle has ended in an Alliance victory, I daresay it's time for some post-battle reconciliation. The victor has but one request. Hear me out... When we get back to Garreg Mach, let's have a grand feast to bring down the walls between our respective houses. And by a ""grand"" feast, I mean a fairly regular feast in the dining hall."
4088,Dimitri: Hmph. I accept your proposition. Please notify me once your preparations are complete.
4089,Edelgard: It seems I have no choice but to drown my sorrow at losing in overindulgence. I'll help you with the preparations.
4090,Claude: It's not a feast if you don't eat too much! Leave it to the Imperial princess to say such wonderful things.
4091,"Edelgard: That's not exactly what I said, but... Ugh, forget it. Laugh all you want."
4092,"Claude: Oh, if you insist! Hahahaha! Hey, Teach. Looks like you're having a good time too. Seeing you smile like that means we've got no choice but to have a great time tonight. Let's get going!"
4093,Bernadetta: It's finally over... There were way too many strangers at that feast.
4094,"Petra: Put your chin high, Bernie. It was a chance for you to have growth."
4095,Bernadetta: But... but everyone was acting so friendly! It was overwhelming...
4096,"Caspar: Linhardt, I wasn't done talking to you! If those Alliance guys came at it from here and those Kingdom guys came from there-"
4097,"Linhardt: I know, I know. We'd have been able to take them all out at once. I heard you. I'm going to bed now."
4098,"Dorothea: Did anyone get the feeling that there were already couples forming? That's not really fair, is it? I wanted to sneak off with someone too..."
4099,Ferdinand: I was hoping for some tea after our meal anyway. Would you care to join me?
4100,"Dorothea:
(if less than B support with Ferdinand) Thanks but no thanks, Mr. Noble. I already have my heart set on someone else.
(if B support or higher with Ferdinand) I suppose I can settle for you just this once, Ferdie."
4101,"(if less than B support with Ferdinand) Thanks but no thanks, Mr. Noble. I already have my heart set on someone else."
4102,"(if B support or higher with Ferdinand) I suppose I can settle for you just this once, Ferdie."
4103,"Edelgard: Until today, I thought it would fall to me to command and guide our ranks all by myself. But with you leading us, I've gotten to experience what it's like to fight alongside everyone... And I've realized... how happy it makes me, fighting under your command. The emperor doesn't take orders from anyone. It's their duty to stand alone and lead the entire Empire. But maybe it's better to have someone to rely on... so that you can support and guide each other through the darkness."
4104,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Am I that someone? (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Choice 2: I am unfit to guide an emperor. (Relationship with Edelgard down)"
4105,Choice 1: Am I that someone? (Relationship with Edelgard up)
4106,Choice 2: I am unfit to guide an emperor. (Relationship with Edelgard down)
4107,"Edelgard: I may be heir to the Imperial throne, but first and foremost, I'm your grateful student. That will never change, even when I fulfill my destiny and become the emperor. I told you long ago that I wished to enlist you in the service of the Empire. Well, I take it back. Now I wish only for your continued guidance during my eventual reign."
4108,"Linhardt: Don't just hide away in the corner, Professor. You're the reason we're celebrating."
4109,"Bernadetta: It's because of you that I've had the courage to leave my room for a bit each day. (sobbing) I'm...I'm so grateful, Professor!"
4110,Ferdinand: We were all just discussing how well you led us. Remarkable!
4111,"Petra: (rigidly) Your guidance is without parallel, Professor. (chuckles) I have had practicing of that phrase."
4112,Caspar: Your training's been top notch. Really!
4113,Dorothea: Whatever would we do without you?
4114,"Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor."
4115,"Edelgard: I feel the same... You are something special, my teacher."
4116,"Dimitri: I had a wonderful time today, Professor. As usual, I was astonished by how much you ate in the name of celebration! Really, though, I must thank you again. Our victory in the Battle of the Eagle and Lion was thanks, in no small part, to you."
4117,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We all did our part. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Yes, that is true, but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential.
Choice 2: I agree.
Dimitri: That's the spirit! There's nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then."
4118,"Choice 1: We all did our part. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: Yes, that is true, but it was your instruction that allowed us to reach our full potential."

4121,Dimitri: That's the spirit! There's nothing wrong with acknowledging your own strengths every now and then.
4122,"Dimitri: I feel silly admitting this now, but when you first came to lead our class...you unnerved me. You never smiled, and you never showed anger either. And yet, you didn't appear to be suppressing your emotions. They just...weren't there. At first I thought perhaps you just didn't care for us, but I soon concluded that wasn't the case at all. For the longest time I just couldn't tell what you were thinking. It was as though you had no humanity whatsoever..."
4123,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That stings.
Choice 2: And now?"
4124,Choice 1: That stings.
4125,Choice 2: And now?
4126,"Dimitri: You're different now. In the half-year we've spent together, I've seen the glow of humanity in your eyes and in your actions countless times. I am truly grateful to have had the chance to spend this time with you, Professor."
4127,"(if Byleth is male)
Sylvain: What are you two talking about? How dare you get chummy without us!"
4128,Sylvain: What are you two talking about? How dare you get chummy without us!
4129,"(if Byleth is female)
Sylvain: Getting cozy, are we? Mind if I cut in?"
4130,"Sylvain: Getting cozy, are we? Mind if I cut in?"
4131,"Dedue: That's enough, Sylvain."
4132,"Mercedes: Oh please, I would love to join you as well! I have so many things I wish to talk to you about, Professor."
4133,"Annette: Oh, me too! I have so much to tell you! And I want to thank you too."
4134,Ashe: Honestly Professor? I was only able to achieve so much because you were with us.
4135,"Ingrid: Ashe is right. You're irreplaceable to us, Professor."
4136,"Annette: Yes, that! Without you, the Blue Lions... Well, we wouldn't even be the Blue Lions at all! Except for the blue part. Because we'd be sad."
4137,Felix: I suppose...there are worse things than fighting at your side.
4138,"Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor."
4139,"Dimitri: Haha, as you can see, you have our trust, as well as our admiration. I look forward to spending the rest of the year with you."
4140,Byleth: As do I.
4141,Dimitri: Good. Then let's give it our all this year! Anyhow... It's getting late. We had better return to our quarters and get some rest.
4142,"Hilda: Ugh, I can't believe our house leader ate so much he passed out. I guess he should just...sleep it off? Oh, Professor! Great work today!"
4143,"Ignatz: As long as we have you and Claude, the Golden Deer House is unstoppable!"
4144,"Lorenz: I am sure we did not require Claude for our victory, but it certainly would not have been possible without our professor."
4145,"Lysithea: Haha! I'm so please to be in your class, Professor. You truly bring out the best in us."
4146,Raphael: Let's keep fighting! And winning!
4147,Leonie: I knew the tactics you learned from the captain would be something else. I better work harder to catch up!
4148,"Flayn: I have had the opportunity to experience much. Please allow me to offer you my gratitude once more, Professor."
4149,"Marianne: Because of you, I managed to get through the fight without feeling like a burden. Thank you, Professor."
4150,Hilda: I hear Lady Rhea and Seteth are singing your praises too!
4151,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You all worked hard. (Relationship with Claude up)
Hilda: You're always so modest!
Choice 2: Our opponents were strong too.
Hilda: Well, I certainly can't deny that.
Choice 3: Just wait until you see my true power. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Oh, wow! I don't doubt it."
4152,"Choice 1: You all worked hard. (Relationship with Claude up)
Hilda: You're always so modest!"
4153,Hilda: You're always so modest!

Hilda: Oh, wow! I don't doubt it."
4157,"Hilda: Oh, wow! I don't doubt it."
4158,"Claude: You really showed them, Teach! I would really hate to be on your bad side."
4159,"Hilda: Oh, look. Claude has been revived."
4160,"Claude: Your tactics were ingenious, and you've somehow mastered the power of the King of Liberation's Relic. You really are incredible. Though you can be a bit absentminded at times. Your mind is like a giant bowl with a tiny crack in it..."
4161,"Hilda: Claude, saying that only makes your own mind bowl seem tiny."
4162,"Claude: How dare you! My bowl is much bigger than Teach's! Unfortunately, it doesn't just have a crack. The whole bottom of my bowl is missing."
4163,"Lysithea: In other words, you are the absentminded one, not our professor."
4164,Ignatz: That's true. He just admitted it.
4165,Marianne: Hehe!
4166,"Leonie: It's unusual to hear you laughing, Marianne. Your smile is really cute."
4167,"(if Marianne and Lorenz have a B support, Lorenz will comment. Otherwise, the dialogue cuts straight to Hilda.)
Lorenz: I agree. You really don't know how beauti-- Eh... Never mind."
4168,Lorenz: I agree. You really don't know how beauti-- Eh... Never mind.
4169,"Hilda: It feels so great to laugh and joke around like this, doesn't it? (Hilda turns away) Hm? Well, look at that. Someone's having a secret rendezvous in the courtyard..."
4170,"Claude: All joking aside, I'm having trouble sizing you up, Teach. The honest truth is that I'd hate to have you as an enemy. If possible, I wish for you to fight by my side. If I could use the Sword of the Creator, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. I bet if I could use it, you would trust me to... Right? That selflessness may be what I like best about you."
4171,Rhea: You fought bravely during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.
4172,"Seteth: Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. I suppose I should praise your efforts.
(If player defeats the most enemies, the above is replaced with:)
Rhea: I can only call your deeds during the Battle of the Eagle and Lion...quite versatile.
Seteth: Comparing against their performance in the mock battle of the Great Tree Moon, the students have grown significantly. It is clear that this is a result of your guidance.
Rhea: In appreciation of your efforts, and to show our high hopes for the future of your students, I award you with this."

4177,Rhea: Please continue to instruct your students as a model teacher.
4178,Sothis: So! You've made good use of all my power after all. I would have been upset if you had failed at such an easy task!
4179,"Seteth: It pains me to assign such a disturbing mission to you during such a blessed moment in time... However, next month your assignment will be to journey to Remire Village to investigate an abnormal occurrence there."
4180,"Sothis: Remire Village... If I recall, you've been there with your father many times."
4181,Byleth: An abnormal occurrence?
4182,"Seteth: I have yet to ascertain the details, but it would seem the villages have been acting strangely. I have already dispatched the knights to verify the authenticity of this information. They should be back shortly. I suggest you begin by finding out what they have discovered."
4183,Rhea: I pray this is not a bad omen... May the goddess protect you all.
4184,"Hoarfroast now graces treetops and open fields alike, and an icy chill blown in from the north of Faerghus blankets the land. All of Fódlan's creatures begin to settle in for a long winter. The setting sun bathes the full winter coat of every wolf in a foreboding scarlet glow. Hunters can now spread the word that the red wolves are back on the prowl.

4252,Shamir: That's what we're dealing with. Is there no chance it's an infectious disease?
4253,"Manuela: There are no absolutes in medicine, but the chances are extremely slim. Restless movements, fits of violence, becoming bedridden or even impossible to wake... With symptoms that varied, there are only a few possibilities. It's either a mixture of poisons or magic. And dark magic, at that."
4254,"Jeralt: You're talking about Remire Village, aren't you, Manuela?"
4255,"Manuela: Oh my, if it isn't Jeralt. Tell me, what was the first thing you heard?"
4256,"Jeralt: Everything after you mentioned that it's not likely it's an infectious disease. My child and I owe the people of Remire Village. If something's happening there, we must help them."
4257,"Shamir: We scouted the area ourselves. Speak with the knights. Hear what they have to say. I must go. Thank you for your help, Manuela."
4258,"Manuela: You know, I'm more than willing to go with you to Remire Village... After all, I owe you my life. If you'd like, I bet we could even manage the mission all by ourselves. Just the two of us..."
4259,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's nice of you. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: Professor! A bit of a tease, are we? A girl could get used to this side of you.

Manuela: You're saying no? Well, aren't you just a great, big bore."

4265,"Manuela: As you like. Good-bye, Jeralt. Good-bye, Professor."
4266,"Jeralt: I'll be in my office making preparations. What about you? If you have the time, it would be helpful if you could go ahead and talk to the knights."

4268,Jeralt: Hey! What's wrong?
4269,"Byleth:

4272,"Jeralt: If anything feels off, return to the infirmary. No need to just grin and bear it. Got it?"
4273,Sothis: Ugh... What could have caused such dizziness? I felt it too. Actually... I've felt that way before...
4274,"Hubert: You look unwell. It's because of what happened, isn't it?"
4275,Edelgard: Don't speak of it aloud.
4276,"Hubert: You can't change the past. For now, all we can do is use it to our advantage."
4277,Edelgard: I know that. I also know that I must steel myself to ascend the Imperial throne.
4278,Hubert: Those preparations are going well. We... Someone is coming.
4279,"Edelgard: Professor, I heard about our mission for this month. Something terrible is happening in Remire Village. That's where you were when fate sent you our way. This feels...preordained."
4280,Hubert: Are the knights making progress with their investigation?
4281,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Choice 2: They are. (Relationship with Hubert up)"
4282,Choice 1: I don't know.
4283,Choice 2: They are. (Relationship with Hubert up)
4284,"Hubert: If what is happening there is by design, there must be someone pulling the strings. There is the Death Knight, of course. And the mysterious mages who were implicated with the Western Church. They showed up when Flayn was kidnapped as well. And now there is another strange occurrence near the monastery... It seems an unknown organization hopes to make the monastery its stage for something."
4285,"Edelgard: Do you believe that all of these incidents are connected, Professor?"
4286,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I do. (Relationship with Edelgard down)
Edelgard: That is the logical conclusion, but I'm not so sure.
Choice 2: I do not. (Relationship with Edelgard up)

Edelgard: Oh? I'm surprised to hear you say that, but actually, I agree."
4290,"Edelgard: Oh? I'm surprised to hear you say that, but actually, I agree."
4291,"Edelgard: It certainly appears that all of the events surrounding the monastery are connected by a single thread. However... I think it's possible that it may just be a result of different motives overlapping. Remember, Professor... If you think of people as simply enemies or allies, it may be impossible to grasp the truth."
4292,"Dimitri: I see. So you'll be staying here for some time, then. Honestly, I'm surprised. I've heard it's been a few years since you last donated to the church."
4293,"Lord Arundel: That was merely because of the financial situation of my territory. I assure you, it has nothing to do with my dedication to the church. By the way, Dimitri... Isn't Edelgard currently enrolled at the Officers Academy as well?"
4294,Dimitri: Yes. She's in the Black Eagle House. I don't believe she has any plans to leave anytime soon. Why not pay her a visit?
4295,"Lord Arundel: I may do just that. It's nice to stay in touch with my dear niece every now and then. Of course I'm also delighted that I was able to speak with my nephew, as well. Whether through marriage or otherwise, family is family, after all."
4296,Dimitri: Of course. The feeling is mutual.
4297,"Dimitri: Professor... If you were watching, you should have made your presence known."
4298,Byleth: Who was that?
4299,"Dimitri: That was Lord Arundel, the Regent for the Empire. He is also Edelgard's uncle."
4300,"Byleth:
Choice 1: An acquaintance of yours?
Choice 2: He called you his nephew..."
4301,Choice 1: An acquaintance of yours?
4302,Choice 2: He called you his nephew...
4303,"Dimitri: My stepmother was his younger sister. We are not related by blood, but he is technically my uncle."
4304,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In other words...
Choice 2: So, you and Edelgard... (Relationship with Dimitri up)"
4305,Choice 1: In other words...
4306,"Choice 2: So, you and Edelgard... (Relationship with Dimitri up)"
4307,"Dimitri: Yes. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Edelgard and I are siblings by marriage. We can delve into that topic another time. For now, let's make preparations to investigate what's happening in that village."
4308,Sothis: Oh dear. The princess of the Empire and the Kingdom's prince are kin! How very odd.
4309,"Byleth:
Choice 1: So that's why he was worried about her... (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: All beings are attached somehow to those who are their family. Yes...even I. I must have had a family too... I wish I could remember them. My family... I wonder who and where they are, and what they're doing now.
Choice 2: I find it odd as well...
Sothis: They likely harbor knowledge they do not wish to share. Oh yes, I'm sure of it. But I suppose we must wait until the time of truth arrives..."

4314,"Sothis: In any case... About this Arundel. You've heard that name before, correct?"
4315,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In the library. (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: Quite true! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been.
Choice 2: In the office. (Relationship with Sothis down)
Sothis: Your memory is worse than mine! The library! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been. Don't you recall?"
4316,"Choice 1: In the library. (Relationship with Sothis up)

4319,"Sothis: Your memory is worse than mine! The library! We came across that name within the library, right where the prince had been. Don't you recall?"
4320,"Sothis: I thought that Arundel had died... And yet, not so. He seems alive and well. I wonder what the prince had hoped to learn from reading of his uncle's charity... So many things the prince has yet to tell... How bothersome..."
4321,"Claude: Tomas doesn't seem to be here... Oh well, that's fine. I've been researching the Heroes' Relics a lot since we last spoke to him. I found out something interesting."
4322,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why have you been researching them?
Claude: Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out.
Choice 2: Something interesting? (Relationship with Claude up)"
4323,"Choice 1: Why have you been researching them?
Claude: Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out."
4324,"Claude: Why? Do you have to ask? Trust me, what really matters is what I found out."
4325,Choice 2: Something interesting? (Relationship with Claude up)
4326,Claude: It's about the connection between Crests and the Heroes' Relics. The Crest Stone of each Relic is carved with a specific Crest-the one that has the ability to wield it properly. The Crests are the keys. You need the right one to safely use a Hero's Relic. The only thing I can't figure out is...why doesn't the Sword of the Creator have a Crest Stone bearing a Crest?
4327,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's by the whim of the goddess. (Relationship with Claude down)
Claude: Hey, now! No need to write off my findings by saying it's a mere whim of the goddess.
Choice 2: It had one in the past. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: Precisely. At least, that's my current guess."

Claude: Precisely. At least, that's my current guess."
4331,"Claude: Precisely. At least, that's my current guess."
4332,"Claude: There's more. I believe the Crest Stones might be the source of the Relics' inhuman power. When Miklan transformed into a Black Beast, he was taken over by something that originated from the Crest Stone. And the Crest Stone was on his body. It all seems to add up. Now, look at this picture I found in the library."
4333,"Claude: That creature is called the Immaculate One, who was supposedly sent by the goddess to save the followers of Seiros. See the pattern on its brow, and the faint circular boundary? Isn't it possible that's a Crest Stone? If all this is true, then Crest Stones are what power the ability to assume massive forms like that of the Immaculate One. And maybe the Heroes' Relics can harness that transformative power..."
4334,Seteth: Oh. It is you. Have you seen Tomas recently?
4335,"Claude: No such luck. I was hoping to speak with him myself, but he seems to be out on the town."
4336,Seteth: I see. Well... Hm?! Where did you find that picture?
4337,Claude: It was in the library. Why do you ask? Is it something my youthful eyes shouldn't be seeing?
4338,"Seteth: No, of course not. However, that is not part of this library's collection. It must belong to Tomas. It would be problematic if it got mixed in with the other books. I will take possession of it for now."
4339,"Claude: (muttering) Take it away where no one can see it, you mean..."
4340,Seteth: What was that?
4341,Claude: That's what Tomas said. He said records that the monastery doesn't approve of tend to disappear.
4342,Seteth: Tomas said that? Preposterous. I have far too much to accomplish to waste time with this foolishness.
4343,"Claude: He was certainly in a hurry. I wonder if he's off to confront Tomas. Well, he took the picture, so I guess that's that for now. I'll see you later, Teach."
4344,"Claude: So, the church is hiding something after all. Some massive secret about Relics and Crests. A secret that must have something to do with the professor's true identity..."
4345,"Sothis: I do not know why it is so, but being here makes me feel quite...unwell. I am so sleepy...and a bit... It is a struggle merely to stay conscious... Are you feeling the same?"

4351,"Edelgard: They say that things rarely if ever go according to plan. Still, plan we must. After all, if we don't effectively force things to go our way, nothing will be achieved. How about you, Professor? Are you leading the life you envisioned for yourself?"

4360,"Claude: Even if I spend all my time rummaging through this library, there's a limit to the knowledge that can be gained. Apparently, it only contains books whose contents have been deemed appropriate by the church. If only Tomas were around. I bet he has some interesting stories he could regale us with…"
4361,"Claude: What in the world is happening in Remire Village? I hear even the knights have been dispatched. I hope it's nothing too serious… After all, that's where we first met. I have valued memories of that place."

4363,"Monica: Hey, it's not like I'm bothering her! Sorry for the ruckus, Professor. Please don't worry about it too much. Nooothing to worry about here!"

4366,"Ferdinand: Remire Village... Is that not where you met Edelgard? If you had not been there, something terrible could have happened. Did one of the house leaders know that mercenaries were staying in Remire Village? I wonder... It will remain a mystery for now. All we can do at this point is speculate."
4367,"Linhardt: I fear I may become a social recluse soon... My life consists of wearing a groove in the floor between the library and the dining hall. Although, I guess a real recluse wouldn't leave their room, eh? That would be me if you weren't my teacher, locked away in my room, reading napping, never to be seen. You know I never see Bernadetta outside of class. I wonder what it is that she does in her room all day."

4400,Ingrid: Hardly! I think about all sorts of things.
4401,"Felix: Oh! Like tomorrow's menu, for instance?"

4408,"Sylvain: I wonder how Remire Village is faring. Hopefully we're not dealing with some new epidemic. It wouldn't be unheard of. Almost 20 years ago, a terrible plague blazed through Faerghus. It even hit the capital city, taking the queen consort's life...or so I heard. The whole Kingdom was in an uproar over that loss. The person who saved the Kingdom wasn't a doctor but a holy woman–the fair Lady Cornelia. After that, she was awarded the honor of being a mage in the service of the royal family. She sounds like an amazing woman, but... She must be pretty old by now. But hey, maybe she's aged like a fine wine."

4418,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's OK to be worried.
Raphael: But worrying about it won't solve my problems! What if I can never eat fish again?

4425,"Ignatz: Aw, come on, let me gush! Did you see how the house leaders came together after the battle? What an incredible thing to witness! Harmony, even after something so hard-fought."
4426,"Hilda: True. If they can keep playing nice, perhaps there will be peace in Fódlan after all."
4427,"Lysithea: I heard about Remire Village from some of the knights. It's certainly troubling. If it's a contagion, we at Garreg Mach should be on the lookout as well."

The underlying cause is as yet unclear, and the most anyone can do is stand back and watch. It is most distressing. Professor, what do you think about all this?"

Choice 1: Some kind of illness.
Gilbert: If it were indeed a disease, why would it only affect the villagers, and not infect the knights stationed there?

4482,"Manuela: I know you figure medicine and magical healing are two ways to do the same thing, but it's way deeper than that. Medicine is all about preventing infection and suppressing symptoms with, well, medicine... That's probably obvious. But magical healing is focused on closing up wounds faster, raising a body's vital energy, stuff like that."

4488,"Monk: During the Red Wolf Moon, wild monsters make ready for the winter to come, stirring more than at any other time of the year. You are off to Remire Village, isn't that right? Watch your step on that journey. May the goddess protect all of you."
4489,"Monk: Hm... You do not look well. Are you sure you aren't coming down with a cold or some other ailment? Please visit a doctor, before your situation worsens. I suppose the infirmary is also an option. Though when I went there the other day, I was unable to receive medical guidance, as Professor Manuela was drunk and fast asleep on the floor..."
4490,"Yuri: I can't shake the feeling that what went down in Remire Village is something other than a plague. I guess it's best not to go sticking our noses in it, lest they get cut off."

4497,"Balthus: Winning the battle was great and all, but the after party was a complete letdown. I guess I get it. There were some younger students around and all that. But still... What a waste. We needed some fun juice, that's all I'm saying. But, yeah, it was still a fine time."
4498,"Balthus: I hear you partied hard after winning the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. That a fact? Fighting... Drinking... Damn. Maybe I shoulda crashed that party. Truth is I knew you'd win. Counted on it, in fact. What do I mean by that? Heh, Don't worry about it."

4705,"Flame Emperor: I cannot abide that. However, if you wish to join forces, I will hear your plea."
4706,Jeralt: What?!
4707,"Flame Emperor: If left to their own devices, they will commit countless more violent acts like this one. Do you not wish to prevent that? With the Sword of the Creator on our side, Solon would not be a threat..."
4708,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I will join your cause.
Flame Emperor: You are lying. I can see that you cannot contain your fury toward me. Pity.
Choice 2: I must refuse.
Flame Emperor: Pity. Though not unexpected."

4713,"Flame Emperor: Pray that you do not live to regret your choice.
(Black Eagles route) Hubert: Jeralt, Professor! Have you seen Lady Edelgard?!
(Blue Lions route) Dedue: Jeralt. Professor. Have you seen His Highness?
(Golden Deer route) Hilda: Jeralt! Professor! Have you seen Claude?"

4716,(Golden Deer route) Hilda: Jeralt! Professor! Have you seen Claude?
4717,"Jeralt: What's wrong, kid? Huh? Damn it! He's gone..."
4718,Jeralt: Hey. I've been meaning to talk to you. Since coming to the monastery...you've changed.
4719,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Changed?
Choice 2: How so?"
4720,Choice 1: Changed?
4721,Choice 2: How so?
4722,"Jeralt: You've been angry since we first arrived in Remire Village. And you look so happy when you're instructing the brats. Before the monastery, I'd never seen you bear your emotions like that. Not once."
4723,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You might be right.
Choice 2: It's thanks to the students."
4724,Choice 1: You might be right.
4725,Choice 2: It's thanks to the students.
4726,"Jeralt: Then perhaps it's a good thing we came to the monastery, if only so I could see your face lit up like that. Or maybe there was never any reason for us to leave the monastery in the first place..."
4727,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A reason to leave?
Choice 2: Wasn't I born after you left the monastery?"
4728,Choice 1: A reason to leave?
4729,Choice 2: Wasn't I born after you left the monastery?
4730,"Jeralt: Ah... I've put my foot in my mouth, haven't I? Though I suppose it may be nearly that time... Come to my office when you next have a moment to spare. There's something I need to tell you."
4731,Sothis: Just what was that about? I can't recall a time of old when you were at the monastery... I wonder what is hiding in the mist that is your past...
4732,"Edelgard: Professor, I don't know if this is appropriate to say, but...admirable work out there. I really believe we did all that we could."
4733,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I wish that were true.
Edelgard: Jeralt said the same thing. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror.
Choice 2: I wasn't strong enough.
Edelgard: No mortal is all powerful. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror."
4734,"Choice 1: I wish that were true.
Edelgard: Jeralt said the same thing. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror."
4735,"Edelgard: Jeralt said the same thing. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror."

4737,"Edelgard: No mortal is all powerful. We must try to stay positive, even through the horror."
4738,"Edelgard: I hear the so-called ""Flame Emperor"" appeared in Remire Village as well. Hubert told me that you spoke with him."
4739,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He said he wasn't involved in this incident.
Edelgard: And do you believe him, Professor?
Byleth:
Choice A: I believe him.
Edelgard: Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?
Choice B: I don't believe him.
Edelgard: That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.
Edelgard: Even if his words are true, his objectives are still unclear. But if the Flame Emperor should someday reveal his true intentions... Maybe then he will appear before you without his mask, and you can look in his eyes and decide what you believe.
Choice 2: He asked me to join forces with him.
Edelgard: Really? Is that what you want, Professor?
Choice A: I do.
Edelgard: Oh? But how can you trust someone without even knowing who they are?
Choice B: I do not.
Edelgard: That makes sense. It's hard to trust someone without knowing who they are or how they're connected to all this.

4755,"Monica: Edel! I need to ask you something! Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I interrupt?"
4756,"Edelgard: No, not at all. If you'll excuse me, Professor."
4757,Dimitri: Professor... I...I'm sorry you saw that side of me in the village. It must have been quite a shock to you and the others. I'm mortified by my behavior. When I saw the chaos and violence there...my mind just went completely dark.
4758,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I felt the same. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Dimitri: I see... So that happens to you as well, then.
Choice 2: You weren't yourself.
Dimitri: I see why you would say that. I always strive to keep my emotions at bay, but... Sometimes the darkness takes hold and...it's impossible to suppress. It just shows you how lacking I am... I have much to learn."
4759,"Choice 1: I felt the same. (Relationship with Dimitri up)

4763,Dimitri: I've told you before...that some day we may find ourselves facing something we simply cannot accept. That's what the chaos in Remire Village was to me. Solon and the Flame Emperor are both beasts who must be eliminated. Demons who kill the innocent. They aren't even human at this point.
4764,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Flame Emperor said he wasn't involved. (Relationship with Dimitri down)
Dimitri: And you believed him?! He doesn't deserve our forgiveness. He became an accomplice when he refused to turn himself in and return with us to the monastery.

Dimitri: It must be hard to fathom. It's true that I don't have any strong connection to those villagers. And yet..."

4768,Dimitri: It must be hard to fathom. It's true that I don't have any strong connection to those villagers. And yet...
4769,"Dimitri: You see, Professor... I saw the same flames of torment just four years ago...in Duscur."
4770,Kingdom General: Please! Have mercy!
4771,"Kingdom Soldier: Gah, the pain! Make the burning stop! Help me... Somebody..."
4772,Lambert: Avenge us! Those who killed us... Tear them apart! Destroy them all!
4773,"Dimitri: Ugh... Gah... My father...my stepmother... Four years ago, they lost their lives to those flames. I'll never forget... I still remember their faces. Their screams. The tortured last moments of every person who died that day... But right now...all that matters is that we do whatever we can to help the surviving villagers get back to their normal lives."
4774,"Dimitri: Thank you. For everything. (Dimitri turns away) There's a reason that I came to the Officers Academy. Just one reason. I came here for revenge. And one day, I will have it."
4775,"Claude: Hey, Teach. That assignment wasn't my favorite, I've got to admit. I suppose pretending to be unaffected doesn't do anyone any good. That was terrible to behold. It's always hard to see innocents die."
4776,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It is.
Choice 2: I wasn't strong enough."
4777,Choice 1: It is.
4778,Choice 2: I wasn't strong enough.
4779,"Claude: Hey, all you can do is keep smiling. Keep marching. That's part of a leader's job. You can't give in to despair. Not just for me or for you, but for all of us in the Golden Deer House. We have to keep smiling so the others can move forward too. As long as we don't show that we're disheartened, they'll know they can make it too. That's what matters."
4780,"Claude: Sorry for getting ahead of myself, Teach. That's how I feel, but how you handle it is really up to you. By the way... I hear that guy who calls himself the Flame Emperor showed up in Remire Village. I couldn't believe it when Hilda told me the news. What could he be after?"
4781,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Heroes' Relics.
Claude: Maybe. After all, he was after the Sword of the Creator in the Holy Mausoleum... But then they kidnapped Flayn and used her blood for their recent attack. Based on that, we should probably assume that their true objective is something other than the Relics. Don't you think?
Byleth:
Choice A: You have a point.
Choice B: What do they want with Flayn's blood?
Claude: They called this incident ""an experiment."" And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume. There are far too many things we still don't know.
Choice 2: World domination. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: Ha! I know I just laughed, but that really isn't funny, Teach. World domination... Hm. OK, actually... I wonder. They called this incident ""an experiment."" And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. I hate to even consider it, but if they can replicate the incident at Remire Village on an even larger scale... If we're not careful, we'll have a full-scale war on our hands. Then world domination wouldn't be a joke anymore.
Choice 3: I don't know. (Relationship with Claude down)
Claude: I was afraid you'd say that. Frankly, there's way too much that we still don't know. They called this incident ""an experiment."" And they said they got what they came for. That means they might take this success and attempt something even bigger next time. Sadly, that's all we can assume."

4792,"Claude: Flayn! Your timing is impeccable. Would you care to join us for a while, fair lady?"
4793,Flayn: Wha--? Why?! Oh my!
4794,"Claude: Damn. She gave us the slip. In any case, I doubt she knows the full story. It seems more like she has something on her mind that she can't divulge."
4795,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're pushing too hard.
Choice 2: We can't go easy on her. (Relationship with Claude down)
Claude: Whoa, there. Settle yourself, Teach."

4797,"Choice 2: We can't go easy on her. (Relationship with Claude down)
Claude: Whoa, there. Settle yourself, Teach."
4798,"Claude: Whoa, there. Settle yourself, Teach."
4799,"Claude: Seems like it would be better to push Seteth for an explanation. Or, best of all, to go above his head and ask Rhea... Now that we know Tomas was an enemy, we can't be sure that exposing the church's secrets would be to our benefit. Where are the answers I seek? Where are they..."
4800,"Rhea: You did well handling that awful business in Remire Village. I am certain the goddess shares in our grief at the senselessness of that calamity. More importantly, I was shocked to hear that our own Tomas was actually a dark mage. I must reflect on our blindness."
4801,Sothis: You surely must! You failed to notice that a rat was hiding in your home. Pathetic! Who are these wicked foes? How did Tomas escape your gaze?
4802,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who are these villains?
Choice 2: Why did Tomas come to the monastery?"
4803,Choice 1: Who are these villains?
4804,Choice 2: Why did Tomas come to the monastery?
4805,"Seteth: Tomas came to the monastery 40 years ago, by recommendation of House Ordelia of the Alliance. Around eight years ago he went back to House Ordelia before returning to the monastery once again just last year. After having worked at Garreg Mach for decades, why would he betray us now? Just what did he hope to accomplish? Jeritza became a professor at the Officers Academy because of a recommendation from the Imperial nobility. Supposing that he is the Death Knight, that means that our enemy is an organization that has taken root in at least two territories."
4806,"Rhea: In the long history of the Church of Seiros... No, long before even that... There have been an endless number of threats to the peace of Fódlan. Yet, those who oppose us still operate in the shadows, their identities a mystery. I believe that Solon and the Death Knight are merely one part of a much larger whole."
4807,Sothis: A threat to Fódlan's peace? That means we have no choice. We have to stop them all!
4808,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What now?
Seteth: Without knowing what their objective is, we cannot afford to act recklessly. The knights will investigate. For now, you and your class should focus on your training.
Choice 2: They must be stopped. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: I have truly come to rely on you. I believe that the monastery will remain safe so long as we have you. We do not yet know the enemy's objective or whereabouts. For now, please devote yourself to preparing for whatever comes next."
4809,"Choice 1: What now?
Seteth: Without knowing what their objective is, we cannot afford to act recklessly. The knights will investigate. For now, you and your class should focus on your training."
4810,"Seteth: Without knowing what their objective is, we cannot afford to act recklessly. The knights will investigate. For now, you and your class should focus on your training."

4813,Seteth: That is all for today.
4814,"Rhea: Professor. Please wait. I know there is much that you still do not understand. However, one thing is clear. You possess great power. I believe that you are destined to be a source of great hope for all. In any case, I expect great things from you. Walk this world proudly, dear Professor. May the goddess Sothis protect you."
4815,Sothis: The goddess Sothis?! Is that what she just said?
4816,Rhea: Is something the matter?
4817,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's nothing.
Rhea: I see. In that case, farewell.
Choice 2: I had never heard the name of the goddess. (Relationship with Rhea down)
Rhea: I see. Sothis is the goddess's true name. Please do not use it carelessly. Farewell."
4818,"Choice 1: It's nothing.
Rhea: I see. In that case, farewell."
4819,"Rhea: I see. In that case, farewell."
4820,"Choice 2: I had never heard the name of the goddess. (Relationship with Rhea down)

4821,Rhea: I see. Sothis is the goddess's true name. Please do not use it carelessly. Farewell.
4822,"Sothis: Do not say something that we may regret! She... I... What exactly am I? For now, let's leave this place. Please... Go!"
4823,"Though most stars will still glimmer in the crisp winter air, the blue sea star has gone back into hiding. Legend states that the goddess prays for peace from her home in the heavens. In the town of Garreg Mach, the anniversary of the monastery's completion nears, and the people's prayers intensify ahead of the millennium festival, still five years hence.

4887,Rhea: We are planning a grand ball for this month. I am sure the students will be most pleased.
4888,"Seteth: Yes, certainly. However, we must not devote all of our time to frivolity. We have a new mission for you. We have found evidence of someone sneaking into an unused chapel."
4889,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A chapel?
Rhea: It is a building that was once a temporary sanctuary at a time when the monastery was under renovation.
Choice 2: Was something stolen?
Rhea: No, there is nothing of value in that building. We do not yet know what the intruders' objectives are."

4894,"Seteth: This month, your class is tasked with guarding the chapel and investigating these intruders. With the recent state of affairs surrounding the holy church, we cannot afford to overlook any abnormality, no matter how seemingly trivial."
4895,"Rhea: I am ordering a seasoned knight to assist you to ensure the safety of the students. In times like these, I am afraid we must always expect the worst."
4896,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's reassuring.
Choice 2: Which knight?"
4897,Choice 1: That's reassuring.
4898,Choice 2: Which knight?
4899,"Jeralt: Reporting for duty, Lady Rhea."
4900,Rhea: I thought you two could use the time to bond. And to speak of important matters...
4901,Jeralt: Appreciate the thought.
4902,Seteth: Bear in mind that Jeralt has a separate mission of his own. He will join you once he has finished it.
4903,Jeralt: It's true. I'll be away from the monastery for a while. But when I return... I'll come and watch you work. I'll be looking forward to it.
4904,"Sothis: Tomas... No, Solon, was it not? And the Flame Emperor... It is most clear that something has transpired. And it relates to you somehow. Or is the fault my own, and you're just caught inside the wave... Sothis, the goddess of this world... I bear her name... Hmm... How confusing. I feel as though my head has turned to mush!"
4905,"Edelgard: Everyone's in such a festive mood. I feel a bit out of my element here. I can't help but worry something might happen while we're all distracted... After all, our enemies are always plotting. Still, this air of levity is much more agreeable than the grim atmosphere of late."
4906,Dimitri: It seems the dastards who set Remire Village aflame have yet to be apprehended. Monsters. Trampling mercilessly over innocent lives. They deserve a gruesome end...
4907,"Claude: Someone entered the old chapel... I think the townsfolk used it for feasts and such in the past. With that whole Tomas business, you can't blame the church for being on edge."
4908,Hubert: Another month full of chaos. I've barely had time to catch my breath. What is the objective of Tomas and his ilk? And what makes Flayn so special–does that not bother you?
4909,"Ferdinand: Ah, the ball. It reminds me of my first such event, back in the Imperial capital. It was held by my father, the prime minister. I really showed off my dancing skills! Everyone was quite impressed with me."
4910,"Linhardt: You know, Professor, I used to think I would be comfortable with all manner of experiments, so long as they provided usable results. But when I heard of Solon's work, well, I realized I'd not consider the moral and philosophical limits of what ""all manner of experiments"" might mean. Urk... Sorry. I'm not great with blood, even when I'm just thinking about it. I feel a bit ill now."
4911,"Caspar: I can't believe this... I'm so angry right now! First it's the Death Knight, and now Tomas, and neither of them are in custody! I can't stand the thought of such evil lurking in the world. We have to do something about this! I have to do something about this!"
4912,"Bernadetta: The ball. A grim reminder of my sad reality. The other nobles will be fine, I'm sure. They've all been to events like this before. But me? I'm a noble, and I've never even been close to one of these things!"
4913,"Dorothea: I wonder if Remire Village will ever be the same again. How do you recover from such a terrible event? So many dead, so much destroyed... I can't see how the whole village doesn't just end up abandoned."
4914,Dorothea: Our class was also sent to help put the village in order. But then…
4915,"Petra: Dancing of Fódlan is not the same as dancing of Brigid. The reason is maybe that the music has many differences. In Brigid, dancing is different for each person. Our dancing has vigor and ferocity. There is no speech of technique for our dancing."
4916,"Dedue: Even though there is to be a ball, we still have a mission. It would be nice if this month passed by in peace."
4917,Felix: Argh... Too much merriment. The librarian betrayed us. The Death Knight is back. Is this the time to be throwing a ball?
4918,"Ashe: Last month was– Well, you know even better than I do. I hope this one will be more cheerful. This ball though... I don't know. It's all new to me."
4919,"Sylvain: Great work in Remire Village, Professor. Who would have ever guessed it was Tomas? Ah, but no. Now isn't the time to get lost in gloomy thoughts."
4920,"Mercedes: Oh, now, where did that Ingrid run off to? The ball is soon and she hadn't even put on any makeup! I was trying to help her out."
4921,"Annette: So, Tomas the librarian was a bad guy? But he always seemed so nice! C'mon, self. You're better than this. You promised you'd be on top of things this month."
4922,Ingrid: Mercedes locked me in her room for hours earlier... She was slathering pounds of makeup onto my face. Saying something or other about the ball. It really wore me out...
4923,"Lorenz: Ah. The long-awaited ball. Finally, an opportunity to showcase my exquisite skills on the dance floor. These skills were ingrained in me when I was a boy. My hands and feet move on pure instinct."
4924,Raphael: The ball is coming up soon! I am so excited! I can't wait to fill up on food while everyone's dancing. I even heard there'll be some prime cuts of meat!
4925,"Ignatz: Some scary things have been happening lately. I hope that this month, of all months, is peaceful. The ball is coming up and everything... Although I'm not much of a dancer actually."
4926,"Lysithea: It's true that Tomas was employed here under the recommendation of House Ordelia. But that's all I know of the topic. I'd never even seen him prior to enrolling here. Even when he was supposedly in Ordelia territory, I never once saw him there. I'm still feeling bothered by all of this, but...there's not much else I can say about it right now."
4927,"Marianne: A ball? Um, I don't think I'll partake."
4928,"Hilda: It's almost time for the ball! Oooh my, am I excited! This being a school, we don't have many chances to get dressy."
4929,"Leonie: I'm glad the Remire Village situation got sorted out. But it's not over yet, is it? And I can't believe old Tomas turned out to be an enemy. Who can you trust anymore?"
4930,"Rhea: Before the ball, it is customary that we host a competition of dance known as the White Heron Cup. The students are quite fond of this tradition. Each house must select representatives to compete. Their dance shall be judged by its beauty, grace, and technique. The student who is deemed the winner will be given the opportunity to train as a dancer, should they so please. It is a very precious thing, the gift of dance. I hope that you and your students will choose to participate."
4931,"Rhea: I have been told that your house won the White Heron Cup. This can only be a result of the students' talent and effort, not to mention your steadfast instruction."
4932,"Rhea: It would appear your house was defeated in the White Heron Cup. With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable."
4933,"Rhea: It has come to my attention that you did not participate in the White Heron Cup. Were none of your students skilled in dance? With the White Heron Cup concluded, all that is left is to wait for the ball. I hope you will find it enjoyable."
4934,"Seteth: I have looked into Tomas, but I just cannot make sense of this at all. From his behavior up until now, I never would have suspected that a man like him could turn on us. I have also discovered that his appearance has changed... It is almost as if he is not even human! What in the world is going on?"
4935,"Flayn: Hello Professor! The ball will soon be upon us. Ah, I can feel my heart fluttering already! I... I have never danced in front of people before. Not even once in all my life. I am very much looking forward to it!"
4936,"Alois: Ah, the ball... It reminds me of how I met my wife. I was at a village's harvest festival. There was a full moon bathing everything in its cool glow. She appeared out of nowhere, dancing gracefully in the moonlight–a lovely fairy!"
4937,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That story sounds fake.
Alois: Hah! The ""full moon"" was an embellishment, I admit. But you can forgive a man for waxing poetic, can't you? Anyway...
Choice 2: That's a wonderful story. (Relationship with Alois up)"
4938,"Choice 1: That story sounds fake.
Alois: Hah! The ""full moon"" was an embellishment, I admit. But you can forgive a man for waxing poetic, can't you? Anyway..."
4939,"Alois: Hah! The ""full moon"" was an embellishment, I admit. But you can forgive a man for waxing poetic, can't you? Anyway..."
4940,Choice 2: That's a wonderful story. (Relationship with Alois up)
4941,"Alois: We soon fell in love and tied the knot. Now we have a daughter, who's as bright and beautiful as a sunny morning. So, whenever I see people dancing, I think of my wife, and my heart does a little waltz."
4942,"Catherine: The area with the old chapel was supposed to be off-limits. It was at risk of collapse, so they didn't even post guards. It's not too strange. Does that surprise you? Eh, Garreg Mach has lots of places that are blocked off for one reason or another. That's true of the underground Holy Mausoleum as well as the northern woods. People call it the sealed forest, but as far as I can tell, it's nothing special. Just a forest."
4943,"Shamir: What's this about? The ball? Knights don't participate. It's an event for students, but it does pique the interest of some knights in particular."
4944,"(After accepting The White Heron Cup quest:) Alois can't dance, but I hear he likes to watch. He volunteered to judge the White Heron Cup. Not that I care."
4945,"Gilbert: It cannot be true that our siblings-in-arms could turn against us. However, I will continue investigating members of the church. To think even someone as senior as Tomas would fall under suspicion... I know not how far to take my search."
4946,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even the knights...
Gilbert: Unlike the monks, the Knights of Seiros are Lady Rhea's direct subordinates. Some are in quite unique circumstances, but I cannot think any of them would betray us.
Choice 2: Even the students... (Relationship with Gilbert up)
Gilbert: Yes, a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year... I must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all."
4947,"Choice 1: Even the knights...
Gilbert: Unlike the monks, the Knights of Seiros are Lady Rhea's direct subordinates. Some are in quite unique circumstances, but I cannot think any of them would betray us."
4948,"Gilbert: Unlike the monks, the Knights of Seiros are Lady Rhea's direct subordinates. Some are in quite unique circumstances, but I cannot think any of them would betray us."

4950,"Gilbert: Yes, a great many strange and terrible things have come to pass this year... I must not dismiss the possibility that someone among the students is behind it all."
4951,"Hanneman: Garreg Mach Monastery is said to have been completed during the Ethereal Moon. Why, 995 years ago as a matter of fact. That's rather a long time ago, don't you think? Every year, a ball is held to celebrate the founding. And every one hundred years, a very special celebration takes place. It's a grand festival, involving all of Garreg Mach. It is thrilling to read of past festivals, and I'm rather excited to experience one for myself. Once in a lifetime, eh? The next one, in five years, will make a millennium. Should be quite an event. Do you imagine you'll still be here teaching then?"
4952,"Manuela: Great. Just...great. It's that time when all the students get all lovey-dovey. You're new, but you know about the ball, yeah? I can't bear it. Young love is wasted on the young. They can't appreciate it to its fullest! Ugh, I wish I could fall in love too..."
4953,"(After accepting The White Heron Cup quest:) Oh! Speaking of the ball, Professor, have you selected your representative for the dance contest yet? If you don't, the contest will go on without your house. And that would be...embarrassing."
4954,"Cyril: Nah, Tomas wouldn't betray the church. I don't believe it. I won't believe it! There's some people in the church who hate people like me who are from Almyra, but Tomas was always real kind. But if he really was Lady Rhea's enemy... Well, I'd defend her against anybody. No matter how kind they'd been in the past."
4955,"Yuri: Not even the tragedy in Remire Village will stop the surface dwellers from getting jazzed about a party. I get that they're probably seeking a distraction, but it still feels pretty damn selfish if you ask me."
4956,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Everyone feels the pain.
Yuri: Look, I get it. I'm still gonna speak my piece about it.
Choice 2: We must move ahead, despite the pain.
Yuri: Ha, gotta keep things upbeat, I suppose. Sorry for grousing. It just got me down is all. (Relationship with Yuri up)"
4957,"Choice 1: Everyone feels the pain.
Yuri: Look, I get it. I'm still gonna speak my piece about it."
4958,"Yuri: Look, I get it. I'm still gonna speak my piece about it."
4959,"Choice 2: We must move ahead, despite the pain.
Yuri: Ha, gotta keep things upbeat, I suppose. Sorry for grousing. It just got me down is all. (Relationship with Yuri up)"
4960,"Yuri: Ha, gotta keep things upbeat, I suppose. Sorry for grousing. It just got me down is all. (Relationship with Yuri up)"
4961,"Yuri: Things have quieted down, but nothing has been resolved. Better stay alert."
4962,"Balthus: The ball really brings back memories. Heh, had some wild times back when I was first enrolled here. Ladies used to line up around the block for a chance to dance with the Debonair King of Grappling."
4963,"Constance: What could I possibly do at a formal ball? I've no status, and I'm not much of a dancer. I think it would be best if I stayed put in Abyss, far from view of anyone."
4964,"Hapi: Sounds like the church has been taking in orphans from Remire Village. They do a good thing every one in a while, I guess. I just hope none of those kids get locked away for stepping out of line."
4965,"Anna: Hey, Professor. How's it going? Making lots of coin? I'd love to catch up, but I'm super busy right now. Working. For money. You understand."
4966,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Ah, other than the legend of the Goddess Tower, of course. Have you heard the students talking about it? On the last night of the Ethereal Moon, on the same night as the ball... If a man and a woman go to the Goddess Tower and make a wish, it's sure to come true! I have a wish, but I can't find anybody to make it with me..."
4967,Byleth: (Is there someone I feel that way about?)
4968,"Knight of Seiros: This is a rare opportunity to enjoy yourself. Please, leave everything else to us. The Remire Village incident, the search for Tomas... We have it handled. You just focus on enjoying the ball with your students. It's for the good of everyone, don't you think? If the professors walk around in a state of distress, the students will be uneasy too."
4969,Girl: ... Our life in Remire Village is gone. Father...and Mother...gone. Why couldn't you have arrived just a little sooner?
4970,"Student: Legend has it that long ago a female student from the academy met with a mysterious man in the Goddess Tower. They fell in love at first sight and were bound together forever after... But that's not really the interesting part. The incredible part is that the man was apparently the Adrestian emperor himself! What I wouldn't give to fall in love at first sight with a splendid and powerful gentleman! I want my own fairytale romance, and I want it now!"
4971,Student: I've been thinking of inviting a girl from a different house to the Goddess Tower on the night of the ball. But here's the twist... She's from a family with a much more significant and storied past than mine. I wonder if she'd ever stoop to going out with the humble son of a knight...
4972,"Student: There's a certain gentleman I'd like to invite to a rendezvous at the Goddess Tower. However, I can't imagine he'd be interest in a sheltered ingénue like myself... Ugh, it's hard to pluck up the courage when that's where my thoughts always take me..."
4973,"Monk: What happened in Remire was...indescribable. The whole village...burned to the ground. So many were left without even a home to return to. Thankfully, Her Grace, the archbishop, has invited those who lost everything to stay at Garreg Mach. I pray that they will be able to return to their once-peaceful lives as soon as possible... Until that day, we of the church must join together and do all that we can to help them rebuild."
4974,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Mr. Backup doesn't come by anymore─which is fine. Not incredibly rude or anything. Nope. Juuuust fine."
4975,"Rogue: They're having a lot of fun up on the surface, aren't they? Some kinda grand ball... Picture them all relaxing, having a drink... Getting to dance with people they fancy... If I showed my face up there, the knights would have my head in a second."
4976,"Mysterious Woman: This is our last occasion to speak. I am ordered to be leaving. They are thinking I am the follower of an evil god. It is not so, but they are not understanding."
4977,"Girl: When I snuck into the monastery a while back, I saw a girl there the same age as me. She was crying. I couldn't believe it. How could you ever cry in a place like that, where there's always food on the table?"
4978,"Rhea: The White Heron Cup is a competition of skill and grace in dance. Please encourage your house to participate. That said, if you are serious about winning, be sure to choose your representative carefully."
4979,"Edelgard: By the way, have you chosen our house's representative for the White Heron Cup? If nobody else comes to mind, I'm willing to take up the challenge, Professor.
""Understood. Just leave this to me and victory is assured."" (Yes)
""I see... If you believe there's someone more qualified, I certainly won't object."" (No)"
4980,"""Understood. Just leave this to me and victory is assured."" (Yes)"
4981,"""I see... If you believe there's someone more qualified, I certainly won't object."" (No)"
4982,"Hubert: On a lighter note. I've heard you've yet to choose a class representative for the White Heron Cup. It's not something I'm interested in, but if no one else wants to do it, then I will shoulder the burden.
""How very whimsical of you. I suppose I'll have to do what I can."" (Yes)
""Wise. Better to choose someone with more charm."" (No)"
4983,"""How very whimsical of you. I suppose I'll have to do what I can."" (Yes)"
4984,"""Wise. Better to choose someone with more charm."" (No)"
4985,"Ferdinand: Do you see what I am trying to say here? Do not make me beg you... Please, choose me as our representative for the White Heron Cup!
""Wonderful! You will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of House Aegir!"" (Yes)
""Hmph. If you really think someone is better suited for it, I will not argue."" (No)"
4986,"""Wonderful! You will have a chance to see the legendary footwork of House Aegir!"" (Yes)"
4987,"""Hmph. If you really think someone is better suited for it, I will not argue."" (No)"
4988,"Linhardt: Let us change the subject and settle my stomach. I assume you've heard about the dance competition? Have you chosen a representative yet? Or... Oh my. You haven't, have you? Have you come to tell me I'm to be it?
""I see... I can dance, in theory, but I dare say in practice things may go very differently."" (Yes)
""I think that's wise. I simply can't really be bothe-- What I mean to say is I lack the confidence."" (No)"
4989,"""I see... I can dance, in theory, but I dare say in practice things may go very differently."" (Yes)"
4990,"""I think that's wise. I simply can't really be bothe-- What I mean to say is I lack the confidence."" (No)"
4991,"Caspar: Ugh. Sorry about that, Professor. I'm just so frustrated right now. I need something to take my mind off things. That reminds me! If you're looking for a volunteer, I'd be happy to represent our class in the White Heron Cup. I'm an excellent Dancer.
""Great! We both know I'm our class's best chance at winning this thing."" (Yes)
""You really think you can find a better dancer than me?"" (No)"
4992,"""Great! We both know I'm our class's best chance at winning this thing."" (Yes)"
4993,"""You really think you can find a better dancer than me?"" (No)"
4994,"Bernadetta: What is a White Heron Cup, anyway? Wh-what?! A dance competition?! That's terrifying! W-we need a representative for our class?! Please, anyone but Bernie!
""You're just trying to humiliate me, aren't you?"" (Yes)
""Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much, Professor!"" (No)"
4995,"""You're just trying to humiliate me, aren't you?"" (Yes)"
4996,"""Oh, what a relief! Thank you so much, Professor!"" (No)"
4997,"Dorothea: I'm sorry, Professor. I'm talking about such grim and terrible things when we could be talking about the White Heron Cup. It's a big dance contest between the classes, and I simply adore dancing. I'm quite good at it, since I was a diva in an opera company, you know.
""I think my heart just skipped a beat. You want me to represent the class? I'm not sure when I last experienced such flattery, Professor."" (Yes)
""What? Why not me? Oh, whatever. So long as you remember to chose someone, hm?"" (No)"
4998,"""I think my heart just skipped a beat. You want me to represent the class? I'm not sure when I last experienced such flattery, Professor."" (Yes)"
4999,"""What? Why not me? Oh, whatever. So long as you remember to chose someone, hm?"" (No)"
5000,"Petra: Are you choosing me to represent at the White Heron Cup? Or are you not?
""I will display all that I have learned. I will grab the victory!"" (Yes)
""I have understanding. You believe that I cannot grab the victory, I am guessing?"" (No)"
5001,"""I will display all that I have learned. I will grab the victory!"" (Yes)"
5002,"""I have understanding. You believe that I cannot grab the victory, I am guessing?"" (No)"
5003,"Dimitri: I... I'm sorry. Please ignore my troubled ramblings. Was something the matter? Something to do with the White Heron Cup? Professor, I beg of you. Please do not chose me as our house representative. I am utterly serious.
""What?! Curse you, Professor. I will of course accept, but know that you have damned us all."" (Yes)
""Oh, thank the goddess. Please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us."" (No)"
5004,"""What?! Curse you, Professor. I will of course accept, but know that you have damned us all."" (Yes)"
5005,"""Oh, thank the goddess. Please be sure to select someone with the confidence to win for us."" (No)"
5006,"Dedue: Incidentally, I have heard there will be a dance competition prior to the ball. Have you chosen a representative yet?
""I will take part, if you insist."" (Yes)
""Someone must want to participate. You would do well to find that person."" (No)"
5007,"""I will take part, if you insist."" (Yes)"
5008,"""Someone must want to participate. You would do well to find that person."" (No)"
5009,"Felix: Ah, whatever. You look like you're about to say something. Are you considering me as our representative for the White Heron Cup? Heh.

""I see. That's a relief."" (No)"
5010,"""I was joking. You really couldn't find anyone else?"" (Yes)"
5011,"""I see. That's a relief."" (No)"
5012,"Ashe: But speaking of the ball, isn't there something happening just before it? The White...Heron...something? It sounds like every class needs a representative. Have you picked ours yet?
""Are you sure you want m-me to do this? I guess I'll just have to do the best I can, then."" (Yes)
""You should pick one of the nobles. They all have experience with this sort of thing."" (No)"

""Me? Uh, sure! Why not? I'll get out there, show off my moves, and drive the ladies wild."" (Yes)
""I get it. No worries, really. I'd rather see a beautiful person dancing instead of some goof like me."" (No)"

5018,"Mercedes: While we're on the subject of the ball, what's this I hear about a dance competition? Physical activity isn't my forte, but dancing can be fun! If there's no one else you'd rather select, I'm happy to represent our class.

""Are you sure? Please let me know if you change your mind!"" (No)"

""Thank goodness. I don't know the first thing about dancing."" (No)"

5027,"Claude: Considering this recent rash of strange incidents, I wonder if having a ball is really the best idea... And then there's the White Heron Cup. Sheesh. What poor sap are you enlisting to represent our house, Teach?
""Me?! Don't be unreasonable, Teach! Ugh... I mean, if I have to make a miracle happen, I guess I'll figure it out..."" (Yes)
""You're a smart one, Teach. I think Hilda or Lorenz would be able to win it for us, no problem."" (No)"

5307,"Hubert: As am I, in the sense that I look forward to destroying all of the unworthy suitors who will inevitably swarm Lady Edelgard."
5308,"Ferdinand: I will admit, Edelgard is adorable. However, when it comes to elegance on the dance floor, I am superior!"
5309,"Dorothea: You're not a bad dancer, Ferdie. But you do have some moves that are...hard to watch."
5310,Ferdinand: You honor me with your kind words! I understand that I am sometimes too dazzling to behold directly.
5311,Linhardt: I'm envious of your positive attitude. I also know how to dance...in theory. Maybe I should participate as well.
5312,Bernadetta: Not me! You wouldn't catch me dancing at a ball any sooner than you'd catch a fish swimming through the sky!
5313,"Caspar: (chuckling) You do tend to flop around like a fish on the land, after all."
5314,Bernadetta: Wh-why would you say that?! Now I feel like a fish on a skillet...
5315,"Linhardt: On a skillet... Hahaha! Ahem, never mind."
5316,"Caspar: Speaking of the ball, do we get to pick who we dance with? I wonder who I should ask..."

5318,Petra: I will fight with all that I have in me!
5319,"Dorothea: Fighting? No, that's not really the point..."
5320,Petra: I will not be as a fish upon the flame!
5321,Dorothea: (sheepishly) Um... OK...
5322,Edelgard: I have a proposition. Let's all agree to meet back at the monastery exactly five years from today.
5323,Caspar: Like a class reunion? That's a great idea!
5324,Hubert: Five years from today will be the millennium festival for Garreg Mach Monastery. I've heard the magnitude of the festivities will exceed all prior years.
5325,"Dorothea: Ooh, how exciting! Sounds like a great excuse to come visit our dear professor."
5326,"Petra: You will be seeing how much growing I have done. You will be pleased, Professor. This idea is good!"
5327,"Edelgard: Who knows where each of us will be in five years' time...or who we will become. Still, I have faith that all of us will gather and celebrate our reunion."
5328,Linhardt: That's assuming the professor is still here in five years...and not enjoying a cozy early retirement.
5329,"Edelgard: Even if that's the case, you will come, won't you? Whether or not you're still teaching here..."
5330,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Choice 2: I will try."
5331,Choice 1: Of course. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
5332,Choice 2: I will try.
5333,"Edelgard: Don't forget, my teacher. Even if the millennium festival should be canceled, I promise to return here..."
5334,"Dimitri: This is the only ball of the year, and I see why. Everyone is absurdly excited..."
5335,"Dedue: Your Highness, you sound so detached. We are all encouraged to enjoy the ball tomorrow."
5336,"Dimitri: Right you are, What a burden..."
5337,"Felix: Huh. I never thought we'd see eye to eye, but I agree. I'd rather be swinging my blade than wasting my time with some girl at a ball."
5338,"Sylvain: Felix! Your Highness! You must be joking, right? This is our chance to dance with all of the ladies of the academy to our heart's content. You wish to throw away the best day of the whole year for sword practice? Insanity, I tell you!"
5339,"Ashe: I'm pretty excited about the ball, myself. It's not like we get to do things like this very often."
5340,"Sylvain: Too true, Ashe. In fact, I'm gonna do you a favor and give you a crash course in chatting up girls. By tomorrow, you'll be an expert!"
5341,Ashe: Actually I'd much prefer if someone could just teach us how to dance...
5342,"Annette: Don't worry about the dancing part. I can teach you that, easy!"
5343,"Mercedes: It's time for the ball! That warrants at least a tiny bit of makeup, don't you think, Ingrid? Just a smidge?"
5344,Ingrid: I...hmm. Maybe. I'll think about it.
5345,"Annette: It's settled! Tomorrow morning we'll meet up in Ingrid's room. Ooh, I can't wait!"
5346,"Dimitri: Hahaha. You know... There's no telling where life will take us after we leave here. If only we could find a way to come together again, just like this..."
5347,"Dedue: A fine notion, Your Highness. Perhaps five years from now?"
5348,Dimitri: Five years from now? Ah! That's when Garreg Mach Monastery will be holding the millennium festival.
5349,Ingrid: By then we'll be addressing Your Highness as Your Majesty instead!
5350,"Sylvain: That's right. I suppose we all know it's coming, but by then you'll be far removed from us."
5351,"Dimitri: Come now. You know me better than that. My title may change, but I won't. And it won't just be me, you know. Five years from now, you'll all have your own stuffy positions to contend with. But as I understand it, the festivities at the millennium festival will be of a scale far beyond anything we've yet seen... In other words, the perfect excuse for us all to return here."
5352,"Annette: Ooh, a reunion? That sounds fun! I wouldn't miss it for the world!"
5353,"Dimitri: I'd love for you to be there as well, Professor. After all, you're the heart of the Blue Lion House."
5354,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'll be there. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
Choice 2: I'll try."
5355,Choice 1: I'll be there. (Relationship with Dimitri up)
5356,Choice 2: I'll try.
5357,"Dimitri: Good. Then it's settled. Of course...if something happens and I'm not able to attend, I'm leaving all of the logistics of organizing this reunion to you, Professor."
5358,Byleth: You have to attend.
5359,"Mercedes: It's true! I'm sure being a king will keep you busy, but it's a bit early to be backing out of your own plans, don't you think?"
5360,Dimitri: Yes... I suppose you're right. I'm sorry. You have my word. I will return as well. Count on it.
5361,"Claude: The time has come for the annual ball. But first, an eve of merriment! OK, I'll admit it. The Officers Academy isn't as uptight as I thought."
5362,"Hilda: Ooh, I adore such things! Dancing is the only thing I'm really good at anyway."
5363,"Raphael: There's a feast tomorrow, isn't there? Isn't there?! Ah, I can't want a moment longer!"
5364,"Leonie: Dancing, singing... I'm not good at either of those things."
5365,"Hilda: So? Dancing is fun! Oh! And remember, you can't dance with the same partner multiple times. It's tradition! That means you have to dance with all of the gentlemen in all of the houses, swapping dance partners as you please..."
5366,"Lysithea: How scandalous. I, for one, plan to simply behold the pure essence of dance."
5367,"Marianne: I'll, um.... watch. From a distance."
5368,"Hilda: You can't just watch, Marianne! If a boy asks you to dance, you simply must accept. It's only polite."
5369,"Ignatz: You can ask...anyone? To dance? Gah, whatever should I do?"
5370,"Lorenz: Hahaha! Lucky you, Ignatz! Tomorrow, if only for a day, you may live out your dearest dreams of an exalted existence! As for me, I am surely to be overwhelmed with the propositions of desperate ladies. I will doubtless have little time for partners of my own choosing."
5371,"Leonie: Which one of you is dreaming now, Lorenz?"
5372,"Claude: Everyone! Listen up. To no one's surprise, I have a brilliant idea. Teach, you'll want in on this too."
5373,Byleth: What's your idea?
5374,"Claude: This may sound impetuous. Perhaps irresponsible. Almost certainly impossible. But we're gonna do it anyway. In exactly five years' time, let's promise to meet again, right here at the monastery."
5375,"Raphael: A reunion? There's usually food at reunions. Count me in, Claude!"
5376,"Marianne: Five years from now... will be the monastery's millennium festival, celebrating 1,000 years since the founding of Garreg Mach."
5377,Ignatz: I hear the millennium festival will be the largest celebration in the monastery's history.
5378,"Hilda: Oh, I get it! It'll be easier for us to all get back here with the millennium festival as an excuse."
5379,"Lorenz: How true. As the new leader of the Alliance, I will certainly have the occasion to attend and pay my respects to Lady Rhea."
5380,Lysithea: That almost certainly will not transpire.
5381,"Claude: And you, Teach? I guess it's hard to imagine that you'll still be teaching here five years from now... But I'm sure no matter where you end up, you'll come running at the chance to see your adorable little Golden Deer again, right?"
5382,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Claude: Who knew Teach had a heart of ice? Too bad I can see from a mile away that you're joking. How you really feel is written all over your face.
Choice 2: Probably so.
Claude: Ahem... That was your cue to promise everyone you'll return. Go on, set a good example, Teach. If you promise, everyone else will, too."
5383,"Choice 1: I don't know.
Claude: Who knew Teach had a heart of ice? Too bad I can see from a mile away that you're joking. How you really feel is written all over your face."

5387,"Lysithea: Hahaha! I'm already excited! After five years, we'll all be whoever we're going to become!"
5388,"Leonie: Please, Professor! Invite Captain Jeralt too! I want to show him how well his apprentice turns out."
5389,"Hilda: It's settled, then. What do you say, Claude? Is it official?"
5390,"Claude: The promise is sealed! That means we're all obligated to keep it. Five years from today, all of us will meet again at the monastery. Don't forget it, Teach. You and I will meet here again..."
5391,"Sothis: Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favorite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!"
5392,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am not everyone's favorite...
Sothis: Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!
Choice 2: It is difficult. (Relationship with Sothis up)
Sothis: So you do think you're the favorite! I might have known."

5397,Sothis: But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.
5398,Sothis: Ah... I see. The Goddess Tower waits for you...
5399,"Edelgard: Ah, here you are. Are you waiting for someone?"
5400,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm not waiting for anyone.
Edelgard: Good. I would not wish to interrupt anything.
Choice 2: I was waiting for you.
Edelgard: (Relation with Edelgard up) For me? Well, you should have summoned me earlier. Regardless, here I am."

5404,"Edelgard: (Relation with Edelgard up) For me? Well, you should have summoned me earlier. Regardless, here I am."
5405,Byleth: Has something happened?
5406,"Edelgard: No, nothing in particular. In fact, that's why I came here. This place, the Goddess Tower... It was special to my parents. My father attended the Officers Academy himself. A few years after graduating, he was crowned emperor. One day, during a visit to the monastery, he snuck into the Goddess Tower on a nostalgic whim. And there she was, my mother. She had just enrolled in the academy that very year. They were instantly drawn to each other. Love at first sight, you could say. It was the first time either had truly been in love... or so the story goes."
5407,Byleth: Their first love?
5408,"Edelgard: Yes. Of course, as emperor, my father had already married for political reasons. As the Empire demands many heirs, he also had numerous other lovers. In the end, my mother settled for becoming one of his many consorts. But I choose to believe there was genuine love between them. Heh, I suppose it's a silly story to cling to."
5409,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's a lovely story.
Edelgard: Isn't it? It's a shame that the lovely stories ended after I was born. For as long as I can remember, my mother had already been exiled from the capital. It's strange. Something about you makes me reveal all of the things I so carefully keep concealed.
Choice 2: Who was your first true love?
Edelgard: Hmmm. For some reason, I feel compelled to tell you all of these things I have kept hidden. I can't say the name, but it was a noble who I met in the Kingdom, a lifetime ago."
5410,"Choice 1: It's a lovely story.
Edelgard: Isn't it? It's a shame that the lovely stories ended after I was born. For as long as I can remember, my mother had already been exiled from the capital. It's strange. Something about you makes me reveal all of the things I so carefully keep concealed."
5411,"Edelgard: Isn't it? It's a shame that the lovely stories ended after I was born. For as long as I can remember, my mother had already been exiled from the capital. It's strange. Something about you makes me reveal all of the things I so carefully keep concealed."

Edelgard: Hmmm. For some reason, I feel compelled to tell you all of these things I have kept hidden. I can't say the name, but it was a noble who I met in the Kingdom, a lifetime ago."
5413,"Edelgard: Hmmm. For some reason, I feel compelled to tell you all of these things I have kept hidden. I can't say the name, but it was a noble who I met in the Kingdom, a lifetime ago."
5414,Edelgard: Anyway... What about you? It's your turn to reveal some long-held secret! You can share a story about your past...or perhaps tell me about your first love.
5415,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have no such stories
Edelgard: You're telling the truth. I can tell. Hm... I wasn't even able to make you blush.
Choice 2: Please don't ask that of me.
Edelgard: You realize that just makes me more curious than ever!"
5416,"Choice 1: I have no such stories
Edelgard: You're telling the truth. I can tell. Hm... I wasn't even able to make you blush."

Edelgard: You realize that just makes me more curious than ever!"
5419,Edelgard: You realize that just makes me more curious than ever!
5420,Byleth: Sorry...
5421,"Edelgard: Heh... No, I'm the one who should apologize. It wasn't my intention to pry. I'm just intrigued by you and your mysterious past. You have supposedly always been a mercenary, but I believe there is more to your story than that... Let's leave it there for today and return to the ball. There must be plenty of students hoping to talk with you...and to dance with you. I would not wish to prevent you from mingling. I cannot keep you all to myself, after all."
5422,"Hubert: Here for a tryst, Professor? I won’t interfere. I shall take my leave at once. Farewell."
5423,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Just a moment.
Hubert: Yes, what is it? I assume you are waiting on someone.
Choice 2: What do you mean, a tryst?
Hubert: You have arranged to meet someone here at the Goddess Tower, have you not?"
5424,"Choice 1: Just a moment.
Hubert: Yes, what is it? I assume you are waiting on someone."
5425,"Hubert: Yes, what is it? I assume you are waiting on someone."
5426,"Choice 2: What do you mean, a tryst?
Hubert: You have arranged to meet someone here at the Goddess Tower, have you not?"
5427,"Hubert: You have arranged to meet someone here at the Goddess Tower, have you not?"
5428,"Byleth: No, not at all."
5429,Hubert: I see. Apologies for the misunderstanding. Then I take it you are unfamiliar with the rumors about this place?
5430,Byleth: What rumors?
5431,"Hubert: There is an old legend that says promises made between lovers here are sure to be fulfilled. If you believe in that sort of thing. I would have expected you to be familiar with the story already, considering how popular you are. I was certain that someone had asked you here."
5432,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am not that popular.
Hubert: On the contrary, I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.
Choice 2: That is not the case.
Hubert: No need to sound so dejected. I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try."
5433,"Choice 1: I am not that popular.

Hubert: No need to sound so dejected. I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try."
5436,Hubert: No need to sound so dejected. I suspect those who wished to ask were simply too daunted to try.
5437,"Hubert: But thanks to their cowardice, I am gifted with this opportunity to speak with you. It’s clear you have never felt at ease around me, as a result of how little trust there is between us. I should get back to the ball, regardless. I imagine there would be quite a scene if you turned out to be lying."
5438,Byleth: You don’t believe me?
5439,Hubert: Trust is not in my nature. Good night.
5440,"Ferdinand: Hello, Professor. I just needed a quick break from the festivities. Fancy running into you here."
5441,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You followed me, didn't you?
Ferdinand: I beg your pardon?! Absolutely not! It is simply a coincidence. The heir to the great house of Aegir, chasing after a woman in the dead of night! The very thought of it!
Choice 2: What a nice coincidence.
Ferdinand: Yes, a coincidence..."
5442,"Choice 1: You followed me, didn't you?

5444,"Choice 2: What a nice coincidence.
Ferdinand: Yes, a coincidence..."
5445,"Ferdinand: Yes, a coincidence..."
5446,"Ferdinand: Anyway, seeing you here, I cannot help but recall the legend of the Goddess Tower. It is said that when a man and a woman meet here by chance on the night of the ball, their paths become one. The goddess blesses them and ensures a harmonious union."
5447,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I heard it differently.
Ferdinand: Oh, you heard the legend too? How was it different? That the goddess is sure to grant any promises made here? Ah, perhaps that is how it goes, come to think of it.
Choice 2: Are you sure that's the legend?
Ferdinand: Indeed, that is how it goes. Or at least, that is the version I heard."
5448,"Choice 1: I heard it differently.

Ferdinand: Indeed, that is how it goes. Or at least, that is the version I heard."
5451,"Ferdinand: Indeed, that is how it goes. Or at least, that is the version I heard."
5452,"Ferdinand: How long have we known each other now? About nine months, by my count. The passage of time is swift indeed. Listen. I need to tell you something. After I graduate, I must pass stern judgement on my father. His greed got the better of him. He has strayed far from the righteous path. As the next Duke Aegir, I will succeed him as prime minister, and it will fall to me to hold him accountable. Only then can I justly guide the Empire's subjects and work to create a better world. That is my dream, my will, and my future. I pray that I will have the courage to fulfill my solemn duty and that I will have your support."
5453,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course. I'm with you.
Choice 2: I'm always happy to listen."
5454,Choice 1: Of course. I'm with you.
5455,Choice 2: I'm always happy to listen.
5456,"Ferdinand: Thank you. Knowing that you are on my side, I feel unstoppable. Well, shall we head back? Plenty of people must be wonder where you went. Specifically the legions of men who would like to dance with you! To be honest, I count myself among them."
5457,"Linhardt: Professor, you're late."
5458,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Linhardt: To tell the truth, it was an act of sheer hope that I might find you here.
Choice 2: We didn't have plans to meet.
Linhardt: True, but a young man can hope to accidentally bump into someone.
Choice 3: Oh, sorry! (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: My apologies, Professor. It was a bit of a joke. I’ve been waiting here because I thought you might come by."

5465,"Linhardt: I'm glad to find I was right. I hoped to find you so I might ask... Well, I would very much like to research your Crest."
5466,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not right now. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Does that mean you might be interested eventually? Let's decide the place and time right now, then. What? Is that not acceptable?
Choice 2: Why would I let you do that?
Linhardt: Because it would be terribly interesting?"
5467,"Choice 1: Not right now. (Relationship with Linhardt up)

5469,"Choice 2: Why would I let you do that?
Linhardt: Because it would be terribly interesting?"
5470,Linhardt: Because it would be terribly interesting?
5471,"Linhardt: Anyway... Have you heard the legend of this place, Professor? It's a sentimental one to be sure. The story goes that if two people share a vow at the Goddess Tower, they'll be bound together forever. Hm, or was it that they'll be cursed forever? One or the other for certain. All the same, I think it's a rather lovely legend."
5472,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It doesn't sound that lovely to me.
Choice 2: Tell me more."
5473,Choice 1: It doesn't sound that lovely to me.
5474,Choice 2: Tell me more.
5475,"Linhardt: Well, I suppose it does depend on your enjoyment of potentially mistranslated myths. Professor, be warned. This may seem forward of me… However, let's vow that one day I will be allowed to research your Crest as much as I please."
5476,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think not.
Choice 2: Excuse me?"
5477,Choice 1: I think not.
5478,Choice 2: Excuse me?
5479,"Linhardt: I've overstepped my bounds again, haven't I? It's just that today is such a special day and, well, I suppose I got caught up in all the excitement. How about this instead? Let's agree to meet here again one day, just the two of us."
5480,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If the opportunity arises.
Linhardt: Such an opportunity won't just arise, we have to make it happen for ourselves. I look forward to that day.
Choice 2: I agree. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: I look forward to that day. I really do…"
5481,"Choice 1: If the opportunity arises.
Linhardt: Such an opportunity won't just arise, we have to make it happen for ourselves. I look forward to that day."

5484,Linhardt: I look forward to that day. I really do…
5485,"Caspar: Hey, Professor! I was looking all over for you. What are you doing up here? I think this place is supposed to be off-limits..."
5486,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I didn't know.
Caspar: Well, that's the official rule. I don't think anyone follows it though.
Choice 2: If it's only ""supposed to be""...
Caspar: Heh! Good point. No one follows that rule anyway, and I heard no one from the monastery really cares."
5487,"Choice 1: I didn't know.

5488,"Caspar: Well, that's the official rule. I don't think anyone follows it though."

5490,"Caspar: Heh! Good point. No one follows that rule anyway, and I heard no one from the monastery really cares."
5491,Byleth: Where did you hear that?
5492,"Caspar: Huh. I can't remember her name. It was just some girl who started talking to me last night. She was trying to get me to leave the ball tonight and go to the Goddess Tower with her. She wouldn't say what she wanted to do here though. Said it was a secret or something. I told her I'd be too busy dancing and stuffing my face with food, so she left. Don't know why, but she didn't seem too happy about it. I guess I was curious though, so I came to check it out. That's when I saw you walking this way, so I followed you in."
5493,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's just awful.
Caspar: Isn't it? She wouldn't explain herself and she got angry!
Byleth: I was referring to you.
Choice 2: I can't help but feel sympathetic.
Caspar: I appreciate that, but I'm not really looking for sympathy. I just wish she would've explained herself before getting all angry.
Byleth: My sympathy was not for you."
5494,"Choice 1: That's just awful.
Caspar: Isn't it? She wouldn't explain herself and she got angry!

5500,"Caspar: Huh? Why? Well, it's all over now. Can't change what's in the past."
5501,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I like your positive attitude.
Caspar: Thanks! I had a feeling you'd get it.
Choice 2: Maybe you should worry about the past a little.
Caspar: Ugh. Really? I just don't like to dwell... But if you say so, I could keep it in mind."
5502,"Choice 1: I like your positive attitude.
Caspar: Thanks! I had a feeling you'd get it."
5503,Caspar: Thanks! I had a feeling you'd get it.

5505,"Caspar: Ugh. Really? I just don't like to dwell... But if you say so, I could keep it in mind."
5506,"Caspar: Anyway, I'm going to head back to the ball. You coming? Doesn't look like there's anything too exciting going on here."
5507,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's head back.
Caspar: Maybe coming to the tower wasn't a total waste of time. I got to talk to you at least, right?
Choice 2: I'm going to stay.
Caspar: All right. Don't stay too long though. You might catch cold."
5508,"Choice 1: Let's head back.
Caspar: Maybe coming to the tower wasn't a total waste of time. I got to talk to you at least, right?"

5511,Caspar: All right. Don't stay too long though. You might catch cold.
5512,"Caspar: Welp, I'm starting to get hungry again. Time to fill up on some more food!"
5513,Bernadetta: (Scared) Ah! Wh-what's that?! Ghost?! Is it a ghost?! Don't eat me!
5514,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Calm down, it's OK.
Bernadetta: It'll eat the skin right off my bones and no one will ever— Huh? Oh, it's you, Professor. What a relief.
Choice 2: It's just your professor.
Bernadetta: I knew it! I said, Bernie, this place is haunted, you'll just get eaten by the ghost of some dusty old professor or— Oh. Oh, it's you."

5519,Byleth: You can relax now.
5520,"Bernadetta: Right. I'm better now. Thanks. But try not to scare me like that again, please... With the ball happening tonight, I was sure there wouldn't be anyone here. And from far off, you look... Well, you kinda have a spooky silhouette. I guess you haven't heard the legend?"
5521,Byleth: Legend?
5522,"Bernadetta: Oh, so if a couple swears a vow on the night of the ball, the goddess grants their wish? That's amazing! Is it true? I guess that's the sort of thing you miss when you spend all your time avoiding people. But wouldn't it be nice to spend some time alone with a nice guy in this lonely tower, cut off from all the rest of the world? Anyway… Oh, Professor! Since you're here and all, could I ask you for a favor? As you probably know by now, it's my lifelong dream to live in solitude forever… So could you help me to swear that vow?"
5523,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Nice try.
Bernadetta: Saw right through me, huh?
Choice 2: I can't promise that.
Bernadetta: Guess you're right. It probably wouldn't work out so well for me, would it?"
5524,"Choice 1: Nice try.
Bernadetta: Saw right through me, huh?"
5525,"Bernadetta: Saw right through me, huh?"
5526,"Choice 2: I can't promise that.

5527,"Bernadetta: Guess you're right. It probably wouldn't work out so well for me, would it?"
5528,"Bernadetta: Ah, well. No use complaining. Actually, I'm happy I got to see you here tonight. Even if it was just by coincidence. Would you mind staying a little longer? It's nice and quiet, and the sky's really pretty. I quite like the atmosphere. On a night like this, being out in the open doesn't seem so bad…"
5529,"Dorothea: Ah, Professor! You showed up!"
5530,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why are you here?
Dorothea: Um, I'm the one who called you here, remember?

Choice 2: What letter?"
5537,Choice 1: Not that I recall…
5538,Choice 2: What letter?
5539,"Dorothea: Are you saying this is...a coincidence? How disappointing to think you didn't come here specifically to see me. Still, if we're meeting by complete chance... that has a certain appeal too. It's as if destiny brought us together! And tonight is the night of the ball... Lucky me."
5540,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What are you plotting?
Dorothea: Plotting? That's a bit rude, don't you think?

5544,"Dorothea: Oh, that's just when you're looking through me in front of others. When it's just us...I kind of like it."
5545,"Dorothea: Originally, I wanted to see what you'd do when you read my letter. I just wanted to see if you'd come here like I asked. I had a feeling that you would. Though, I suppose you didn't even read the letter to begin with… I should just be thankful I wasn't left here waiting. All alone. Forever. Do you know it's been almost nine whole moons since you arrived at Garreg Mach? You must have found a special someone by now, haven't you, Professor?"
5546,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have.
Dorothea: Ooh? Who could it be? You've made me so curious. Oh, don't worry. I'm not going to pry if you don't want to share. Your private life is private, after all.
Choice 2: I have not.

Choice 3: Is that what you wanted to talk about?
Dorothea: Are you changing the subject? Don't do that. Ohh, I bet that means you do have someone, don't you? Don't you worry, I won't pry if you don't want to share. These things are private, after all."

5553,"Dorothea: Well, I oughta get going… I wouldn't want to be in the way if your special someone shows up. Either way, I do hope you'll share a dance with me later."
5554,"Petra: Professor, what is bringing you here? Is the ball not enjoyable?"

5565,"Petra: I have been hearing about a legend. About the Goddess Tower. People have a belief that the goddess watches this place on this night. If you share a promise, the goddess will make that promise become true. That makes men and women who are close come to this place. On this night. I am wanting to see that, and so I came to observe. With secrecy. But no one is here. I have much disappointment."
5566,"Byleth:

5570,"Petra: Yes, that has truth. I will be thinking about that from now on."
5571,"Petra: Oh! I have a realization! If someone sees us here with each other, they will think that we are with each other! That is not accepting...acceptable for people to misunderstand!"
5572,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That could be a problem.
Petra: We should be returning to the ball, separately.
Choice 2: I wouldn't mind. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Is that OK, Professor? I think we are agreeing on that. Maybe we should be returning to the ball... with each other."
5573,"Choice 1: That could be a problem.
Petra: We should be returning to the ball, separately."
5574,"Petra: We should be returning to the ball, separately."
5575,"Choice 2: I wouldn't mind. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Is that OK, Professor? I think we are agreeing on that. Maybe we should be returning to the ball... with each other."
5576,"Petra: Is that OK, Professor? I think we are agreeing on that. Maybe we should be returning to the ball... with each other."
5577,"Dimitri: It's quiet here, isn't it, Professor? That reminds me. Do you know the legend associated with the Goddess Tower?"
5578,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've heard it.
Dimitri: Is that right? You don't strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that.
Choice 2: I'm not concerned with such things.
Dimitri: Just as expected."
5579,"Choice 1: I've heard it.
Dimitri: Is that right? You don't strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that."
5580,Dimitri: Is that right? You don't strike me as the sort to enjoy stories like that.
5581,"Choice 2: I'm not concerned with such things.
Dimitri: Just as expected."
5582,Dimitri: Just as expected.
5583,Dimitri: They say that wishes made in this tower will come true. I wonder who came up with such a silly notion.
5584,Byleth: You don't believe it?
5585,"Dimitri: Legends are legends, nothing more. I doubt there are many who really believe that wishes can be granted. The goddess just watches over us from above... That is all. No matter how hard someone begs to be saved, she would never so much as offer her hand. And even if she did, we lack the means to reach out and grasp it. That's how I feel about her. In any case... I suppose there's no harm in passing the time with silly legends. What do you say, Professor? Care to make a wish? We are here on the night of the ball. Why don't you try wishing for something?"
5586,"Byleth:
Choice 1: After you.
Choice 2: I can't think of anything, so go ahead."
5587,Choice 1: After you.
5588,"Choice 2: I can't think of anything, so go ahead."
5589,Dimitri: A wish of my own... I suppose my wish...is for a world in which no one would ever be unjustly taken from us. Or...something along those lines.
5590,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's a great wish.
Choice 2: I'll wish for the same."
5591,Choice 1: That's a great wish.
5592,Choice 2: I'll wish for the same.
5593,"Dimitri: Thank you, Professor. Although, at a time like this... Perhaps it would make more sense for me to wish that we'll be together forever. What do you think?"
5594,Byleth: …
5595,"Dimitri: … Haha! Well now, Professor! You must admit I've improved in the art of joke telling."
5596,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's cruel.
Choice 2: It didn't sound like a joke."
5597,Choice 1: That's cruel.
5598,Choice 2: It didn't sound like a joke.
5599,"Dimitri: I'm sorry... I guess that was rather thoughtless of me. … Honestly... I do regret saying such a thing. Please think nothing of it. I've blurted out irresponsible things like that to my classmates. Promises that we'll see each other again and the like. I have no business making such promises for the future. There are certain things that I must accomplish, even if it means risking my life. I may not even have a future to promise to someone."
5600,Byleth: …
5601,"Dimitri: We should head back soon. It's rude of me to keep you all to myself. Shall we, Professor?"
5602,Dedue: What are you doing here?
5603,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I could ask you the same.
Choice 2: I needed some quiet.
Dedue: I felt similarly."
5604,Choice 1: I could ask you the same.
5605,"Choice 2: I needed some quiet.
Dedue: I felt similarly."
5606,Dedue: I felt similarly.
5607,"Dedue: Though I elected to attend this ball, I did not know what to do with myself once there. I do not wish to be a nuisance to His Highness or to my classmates. Thus, I have sought solitude. I noticed a number of people looking for you, however. Should you not return to the festivities?"
5608,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I’d like to stay here a bit longer.
Choice 2: Not just yet."
5609,Choice 1: I’d like to stay here a bit longer.
5610,Choice 2: Not just yet.
5611,Dedue: As you wish.
5612,Dedue: …
5613,Byleth: …
5614,"Dedue: The stars seem brighter here, somehow. I have heard the goddess of Fódlan grants a special blessing at this tower. The blessing ensures that any oath sworn between man and woman here shall be fulfilled. That is what I have heard. We had similar legends in Duscur. Some elements of human culture are universal, I suppose. Is there an oath you would like to swear?"
5615,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not that I can think of.
Dedue: I understand.
Choice 2: I swear to work toward peace for Fódlan.
Dedue: I am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible."
5616,"Choice 1: Not that I can think of.
Dedue: I understand."
5617,Dedue: I understand.
5618,"Choice 2: I swear to work toward peace for Fódlan.
Dedue: I am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible."
5619,Dedue: I am not sure that a full and lasting peace is possible.
5620,"Dedue: But while I have this opportunity, permit me to swear an oath to you. I swear that we will look upon these same stars again, when His Highness has led us to a more tranquil age."
5621,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That is a worthy oath.
Choice 2: I look forward to it."
5622,Choice 1: That is a worthy oath.
5623,Choice 2: I look forward to it.
5624,"Dedue: Good. There is a chill in the air, is there not? I am accustomed to cold weather. But you should go back indoors."
5625,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let’s go back together.
Dedue: If you wish. I suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done.
Choice 2: Will you share a dance with me?
Dedue: I do not know how to dance. If you wish to teach me, then I will endeavor to learn."
5626,"Choice 1: Let’s go back together.
Dedue: If you wish. I suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done."
5627,Dedue: If you wish. I suppose the damage to your reputation for being seen with me has already been done.
5628,"Choice 2: Will you share a dance with me?
Dedue: I do not know how to dance. If you wish to teach me, then I will endeavor to learn."
5629,"Dedue: I do not know how to dance. If you wish to teach me, then I will endeavor to learn."
5630,"Dedue: Let us return. If the cold is too much, I will lend you my coat."
5631,"Felix: Oh, look who it is."
5632,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What are you doing here?
Felix: I just wanted some quiet. It's so loud, I needed a little respite.
Choice 2: Are you waiting for someone?
Felix: No. I just wanted a bit of quiet."
5633,"Choice 1: What are you doing here?
Felix: I just wanted some quiet. It's so loud, I needed a little respite."
5634,"Felix: I just wanted some quiet. It's so loud, I needed a little respite."
5635,"Choice 2: Are you waiting for someone?
Felix: No. I just wanted a bit of quiet."
5636,Felix: No. I just wanted a bit of quiet.
5637,"Felix: Besides, what are you doing here?"
5638,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I thought I might find you here.
Felix: Huh? You must be joking.
Choice 2: I'm here for the same reason as you.
Felix: Ah. Well, I guess it figures."
5639,"Choice 1: I thought I might find you here.
Felix: Huh? You must be joking."
5640,Felix: Huh? You must be joking.
5641,"Choice 2: I'm here for the same reason as you.
Felix: Ah. Well, I guess it figures."
5642,"Felix: Ah. Well, I guess it figures."
5643,"Felix: Hm. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? That if you make a pledge, it will be fulfilled? Childish, I know. But if it were true... Let's make a pledge to the goddess. I pledge that someday, I will surpass you. I'll surpass your technique, your skill with the sword, and your cunning as a warrior. Then I will make you taste defeat!"
5644,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That seems extreme.
Choice 2: That's your pledge to the goddess?"
5645,Choice 1: That seems extreme.
5646,Choice 2: That's your pledge to the goddess?
5647,"Felix: What a disappointment. If you're looking for a passionate affair, you've got the wrong man. Go find someone else. I've spent my life avoiding love and romance. They're distractions. Blades, blood, and battle. That's what I'm made of and nothing else. If someone saw us, however, this may look like an amorous meeting. You'll have to settle for being mistaken as my lover."
5648,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's mean.
Choice 2: What nonsense."
5649,Choice 1: That's mean.
5650,Choice 2: What nonsense.
5651,Felix: It's time I went back to training. I'll always be more comfortable holding a sword than a woman's hand. Try not to catch a cold up here. I'd hate for such a good sparring partner to be out of commission. Good-bye.
5652,Ashe: Professor! Did you come up here for a rest too?
5653,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That’s right.
Ashe: I guess we think along the same lines. I was feeling kind of worn out.
Choice 2: Actually, I was looking for you.
Ashe: For me? Oh! I’m so sorry to put you out of your way! I was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement. I am enjoying the ball, but it’s a bit much, you know?"
5654,"Choice 1: That’s right.
Ashe: I guess we think along the same lines. I was feeling kind of worn out."
5655,Ashe: I guess we think along the same lines. I was feeling kind of worn out.
5656,"Choice 2: Actually, I was looking for you.
Ashe: For me? Oh! I’m so sorry to put you out of your way! I was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement. I am enjoying the ball, but it’s a bit much, you know?"
5657,"Ashe: For me? Oh! I’m so sorry to put you out of your way! I was just kind of worn out from all of the excitement. I am enjoying the ball, but it’s a bit much, you know?"
5658,"Ashe: Everyone else seems used to this kind of thing, but I’ve never been to anything like it before. My friends did teach me a bit about proper manners and how to dance, but I still feel out of place. Stepping on girls’ feet, messing up the pretty floral decorations… Haha, I’ve been a bit of a disaster. Sometimes I wonder if it’s even right for someone like me to be in a place like this."
5659,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I feel that way sometimes too.
Ashe: Really? You do? That’s kind of reassuring!
Choice 2: You have every right to be here.
Ashe: You're right, of course. I'm a student at the Officers Academy, just like everyone else. Lonato was kind enough to send me here. I need to live up to his expectations."
5660,"Choice 1: I feel that way sometimes too.
Ashe: Really? You do? That’s kind of reassuring!"
5661,Ashe: Really? You do? That’s kind of reassuring!
5662,"Choice 2: You have every right to be here.
Ashe: You're right, of course. I'm a student at the Officers Academy, just like everyone else. Lonato was kind enough to send me here. I need to live up to his expectations."
5663,"Ashe: You're right, of course. I'm a student at the Officers Academy, just like everyone else. Lonato was kind enough to send me here. I need to live up to his expectations."
5664,"Ashe: By the way, have you heard the stories about the Goddess Tower? They say that if a man and a woman make a wish together here, the goddess will make it come true."
5665,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What would you wish for?
Ashe: Oh, never mind me. I'd like to know what you'd wish for!
Choice 2: Let’s make a wish together, then.
Ashe: My thoughts exactly! Do you have anything in particular you’d like to wish for?"
5666,"Choice 1: What would you wish for?
Ashe: Oh, never mind me. I'd like to know what you'd wish for!"
5667,"Ashe: Oh, never mind me. I'd like to know what you'd wish for!"
5668,"Choice 2: Let’s make a wish together, then.
Ashe: My thoughts exactly! Do you have anything in particular you’d like to wish for?"
5669,Ashe: My thoughts exactly! Do you have anything in particular you’d like to wish for?
5670,Byleth: My wish is…
5671,Ashe: Your wish is?
5672,"Byleth:
Choice 1: For your wish to come true, Ashe.
Ashe: What? My wish? W-well, um...let me think.
Choice 2: I can’t think of anything.
Ashe: Well, if you can't come up with anything, maybe I should think of a wish instead?"
5673,"Choice 1: For your wish to come true, Ashe.
Ashe: What? My wish? W-well, um...let me think."
5674,"Ashe: What? My wish? W-well, um...let me think."
5675,"Choice 2: I can’t think of anything.
Ashe: Well, if you can't come up with anything, maybe I should think of a wish instead?"
5676,"Ashe: Well, if you can't come up with anything, maybe I should think of a wish instead?"
5677,"Ashe: All right, I’ve got it. I wish for my brother and sister back home to be able to live out their lives in peace."
5678,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That’s just like you.
Choice 2: That’s a lovely wish."
5679,Choice 1: That’s just like you.
5680,Choice 2: That’s a lovely wish.
5681,"Ashe: This kind of thing is pretty embarrassing, huh? Maybe I should be heading back. I’ll never get better at fancy social events like this if I keep running away from them, right? I guess I should ask another girl to dance. Oh, but I’d better make sure I go over the steps again first."
5682,Byleth: You could dance with me.
5683,"Ashe: Really? You’d do that? Wow, that’d be great! Just promise not to laugh if I mess it up, OK? Come on. Let’s head back."
5684,"Sylvain: Evening, Professor. Lovely night, isn’t it? Just look at those stars… I heard you were headed over to the Goddess Tower, and I got curious about who you might be meeting. But here you are all by yourself. This isn’t a lover’s tryst at all! Heh heh…"
5685,Byleth: Tryst?
5686,"Sylvain: Oh, yeah. The Goddess Tower is where lovers meet. Didn’t anybody tell you? They say that if you exchange vows here, they always come true. It’s a sacred place for lovers."
5687,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why are you here alone?
Choice 2: Where is your lover?"
5688,Choice 1: Why are you here alone?
5689,Choice 2: Where is your lover?
5690,"Sylvain: Well, the person I’m interested in...is already here. You’re here alone. I’m here alone. I was thinking maybe…"
5691,Byleth: Wait. Me?
5692,"Sylvain: Well, of course! We’re the only two people here, aren’t we? I keep thinking about it, and it just makes sense. My Crest and yours…"
5693,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That’s too much, too soon.
Choice 2: Marry you? I can’t even trust you."
5694,"Choice 1: That’s too much, too soon."
5695,Choice 2: Marry you? I can’t even trust you.
5696,"Sylvain: Heh, OK. True, true. You know, I’ve never regretted any of my past behavior...until you turned me down just now. I can’t be who I’ve been my whole life. I gotta get it together and become a man you can trust. I know that sounds like another one of my games, but it’s true. I’ll prove it to you. Anyway, I’m going to head back to the ball. Since we’re both here, would you accompany me?"
5697,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I’ll go back with you.
Sylvain: Well then, my lady, I do hope you’ll give me the honor of a dance. It will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception. Heh heh—I’m kidding!
Choice 2: I’m going to stay here for awhile.
Sylvain: It's chilly out tonight, so take care not to catch cold. And if you do get cold, you know where to find me. Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess... OK. Well, I'm headed inside."
5698,"Choice 1: I’ll go back with you.
Sylvain: Well then, my lady, I do hope you’ll give me the honor of a dance. It will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception. Heh heh—I’m kidding!"
5699,"Sylvain: Well then, my lady, I do hope you’ll give me the honor of a dance. It will be good practice for our first dance at our wedding reception. Heh heh—I’m kidding!"
5700,"Choice 2: I’m going to stay here for awhile.
Sylvain: It's chilly out tonight, so take care not to catch cold. And if you do get cold, you know where to find me. Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess... OK. Well, I'm headed inside."
5701,"Sylvain: It's chilly out tonight, so take care not to catch cold. And if you do get cold, you know where to find me. Sorry. Old habits die hard, I guess... OK. Well, I'm headed inside."
5702,Sylvain: Anyway… Let’s get going before you change your mind.
5703,"Mercedes: Why, Professor! I was wondering where you ran off to. I searched the entire floor but couldn't find you anywhere. Tired, are we? I can tell by that look on your face. It must be exhausting being so popular, huh?"
5704,Byleth: I'm exhausted...
5705,"Mercedes: I can imagine. Shall we take a break here, then? Say, Professor. Have you heard the legend of the Goddess Tower? They say that if two people exchange a vow here, the goddess herself will fulfill it."
5706,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've never heard that before.
Mercedes: Well, that simply won't do. You'll fall behind if you can't keep up with your students!
Choice 2: I think I recall such a story.
Mercedes: Ah, so even you have heard that one. The stories must travel far."
5707,"Choice 1: I've never heard that before.
Mercedes: Well, that simply won't do. You'll fall behind if you can't keep up with your students!"
5708,"Mercedes: Well, that simply won't do. You'll fall behind if you can't keep up with your students!"
5709,"Choice 2: I think I recall such a story.
Mercedes: Ah, so even you have heard that one. The stories must travel far."
5710,"Mercedes: Ah, so even you have heard that one. The stories must travel far."
5711,"Mercedes: Many young couples come here in private, all thanks to that legend. They make promises to stay together forever. Things like that. I actually saw a man invite a lady to join him at the tower while on my way here. It's rather romantic, don't you think?"
5712,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think so.
Mercedes: Indeed.
Choice 2: I disagree.
Mercedes: Really? You're a strange one, Professor."
5713,"Choice 1: I think so.
Mercedes: Indeed."
5714,Mercedes: Indeed.
5715,"Choice 2: I disagree.
Mercedes: Really? You're a strange one, Professor."
5716,"Mercedes: Really? You're a strange one, Professor."
5717,"Mercedes: Though, just because two people share a promise, that doesn't guarantee they'll be together forever. You've noticed many nobles at the academy, right? They very rarely have the freedom to choose their own partners. Yet still they wish to stay together. Maybe that's why they pray to the goddess. Are you waiting on anyone, Professor?"
5718,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No, there's no one.
Mercedes: What a relief. I was afraid that I was keeping you.
Choice 2: I was waiting for you.
Mercedes: Oh my. Even though we didn't make plans to meet? You're a charmer, aren't you?"
5719,"Choice 1: No, there's no one.
Mercedes: What a relief. I was afraid that I was keeping you."
5720,Mercedes: What a relief. I was afraid that I was keeping you.
5721,"Choice 2: I was waiting for you.
Mercedes: Oh my. Even though we didn't make plans to meet? You're a charmer, aren't you?"
5722,"Mercedes: Oh my. Even though we didn't make plans to meet? You're a charmer, aren't you?"
5723,"Mercedes: Ah! I almost forgot why I came looking for you! I was wondering if you'd like to dance with me. It's just so loud in the reception hall though. I think I'd rather stay here with you... If that's all right with you, Professor. Thank you. I appreciate it."
5724,Annette: Professor! I'm happy to see you here. Everybody's been asking about you. You're really popular with the students.
5725,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I had to escape.
Choice 2: I'm worn out."
5726,Choice 1: I had to escape.
5727,Choice 2: I'm worn out.
5728,"Annette: Oh, really? Huh. Uh, actually, I've been trying to find you too. But if you're not interested in dancing, that's OK. We are supposed to be at a ball thought... If you're not going to dance tonight, when and where will you get another chance?"
5729,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Here.
Choice 2: Now."
5730,Choice 1: Here.
5731,Choice 2: Now.
5732,"Annette: Wait...really? There isn't any music... But this is too special to pass up! Maybe...I could sing a little something. I may not look like it, but I'm a practiced singer. Though...people do tend to think my lyrics are a little odd. ♪ Fry the food, it tastes so good... It fills up our hungry tummies... ♪"
5733,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Now I'm hungry.
Choice 2: What an interesting song."
5734,Choice 1: Now I'm hungry.
5735,Choice 2: What an interesting song.
5736,"Annette: It's about this yummy stew one of the monks taught me to make a while back. Oh, I know! I'll make it for you! It really is just about the tastiest thing in the world. Um... If I'm bothering you, please tell me now and I'll leave you alone."
5737,Byleth: …
5738,"Annette: Say, Professor... Did you know that if you make a wish here at the Goddess Tower, it will for sure come true? That's why people usually meet up with someone they like here. For a rendezvous! And they make a wish that they'll stay together forever. So... Uh, I thought you might be waiting for a girl here. And that I'm messing it up."
5739,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've never heard about that tradition.
Choice 2: Nothing of the sort."
5740,Choice 1: I've never heard about that tradition.
5741,Choice 2: Nothing of the sort.
5742,"Annette: Hehe, that's just what I'd expect you to say! But since we're already here, let's go ahead and made a wish together."
5743,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What kind of wish?
Choice 2: Sure."
5744,Choice 1: What kind of wish?
5745,Choice 2: Sure.
5746,Annette: I've already decided what it will be. Dearest Goddess... I wish for the professor and I to always be the best of friends! How's that sound? Can we wish for that?
5747,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'd be happy to.
Annette: Really? That makes me so happy!
Choice 2: It's a little embarrassing...
Annette: Oh no! Actually, when I said it aloud, I could tell it was an embarrassing wish... Oops!"
5748,"Choice 1: I'd be happy to.
Annette: Really? That makes me so happy!"
5749,Annette: Really? That makes me so happy!
5750,"Choice 2: It's a little embarrassing...
Annette: Oh no! Actually, when I said it aloud, I could tell it was an embarrassing wish... Oops!"
5751,"Annette: Oh no! Actually, when I said it aloud, I could tell it was an embarrassing wish... Oops!"
5752,"Annette: Well, I'd better be going now, and you should think about returning to the ball too. But make sure you save me a dance!"
5753,"Ingrid: Whew, I can't manage one more bite. So full...(blushes) So full!"
5754,(Byleth enters)
5755,Ingrid: Oh! Professor! What do you think you're doing here?! I came here to stuff my fa—I mean to have some ME time.
5756,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I sort of followed you...
Ingrid: You mean you saw that just now? All the food? Everything?! Ugh, so embarrassing... Maybe there's a nearby rock I can crawl under.
Choice 2: No reason, really.
Ingrid: Oh, so we're just running into one another by chance, then. Phew. If you had followed me here, I'd be a little...bothered. And probably embarrassed."
5757,"Choice 1: I sort of followed you...
Ingrid: You mean you saw that just now? All the food? Everything?! Ugh, so embarrassing... Maybe there's a nearby rock I can crawl under."

5760,"Ingrid: Oh, so we're just running into one another by chance, then. Phew. If you had followed me here, I'd be a little...bothered. And probably embarrassed."
5761,Byleth: Were you waiting for someone?
5762,"Ingrid: Who, me? No, no, of course not. I was just about to walk off all that food I just ate. Really, I came here to have some privacy. But you're here now, so I suppose that makes it a bit less private."
5763,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you worried people may get the wrong idea?
Ingrid: I suppose there's that possibility, now that you mention it.
Choice 2: Just the two of us...
Ingrid: Uh...well, yes. I suppose it's just us here..."
5764,"Choice 1: Are you worried people may get the wrong idea?
Ingrid: I suppose there's that possibility, now that you mention it."
5765,"Ingrid: I suppose there's that possibility, now that you mention it."
5766,"Choice 2: Just the two of us...
Ingrid: Uh...well, yes. I suppose it's just us here..."
5767,"Ingrid: Uh...well, yes. I suppose it's just us here..."
5768,"Ingrid: Does that concern you too, Professor? I'm happy to return to the reception hall."
5769,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's not terribly concerning, really.
Ingrid: Of course. Nothing to see here! I'm happy to keep walking off this food, in that case. Ah, the stars certainly are beautiful tonight, hm? It's peaceful, looking up at them together, don't you think? Maybe we can do it again sometime.
Choice 2: I'd love to come along.
Ingrid: If we return from here together, I worry that people would start unsavory rumors about us. I don't concern myself with gossip, but I'd hate for it to mar your reputation in any way. Are you certain? Fair enough. Let's head back, then."
5770,"Choice 1: It's not terribly concerning, really.

5774,"Claude: Oh. Hey, Teach. What brings you to the Goddess Tower? You know what, never mind. The answer is as clear as day. You couldn't bear the ball anymore and simply had to escape."
5775,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I wouldn't say that...
Choice 2: I just needed a break."
5776,Choice 1: I wouldn't say that...
5777,Choice 2: I just needed a break.
5778,"Claude: There's nothing wrong with admitting you're not comfortable in a noisy crowd. Really, I get it. I'm the same way."
5779,Byleth: I don't believe it.
5780,"Claude: Ha! See right through me, do you? But I really do mean it. Parties aren't for me. Music and fun are all well and good, but those dances the nobles do are...something else. I was never really taught to do that sort of thing. My upbringing was...lacking in certain ways."
5781,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even though you're from a noble family?
Choice 2: Even though you're heir to the Alliance?"
5782,Choice 1: Even though you're from a noble family?
5783,Choice 2: Even though you're heir to the Alliance?
5784,"Claude: Even so. I may have secured a fancy new title, but who I am on the inside... Well, status alone can't change that. That's a bit of an aside, though. Say, Teach... have you heard the legends about this tower? They say if a man and a woman pray for the same thing here, on this night, the goddess will grant their wish without fail."
5785,Byleth: Why tonight?
5786,"Claude: Who knows? Maybe it has something to do with celebrating the anniversary of the monastery's completion. Maybe the goddess comes down from above on this night and this night alone to celebrate with us. Even goddesses like to party, right? The truth is that it's just a legend the students here like to tell. It's not based on any real facts. But I suppose it would be a waste to pass up a chance of having our wish granted. What do you say, Teach? Care to try?"
5787,Byleth: What would we pray for?
5788,"Claude: Hm... Let's see... How about we pray for our ambitions to come true? You don't exactly seem like the selfish type, but even you must have an ambition or two."
5789,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I do.
Choice 2: I do not.
Choice 3: More of a hope...
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
Claude: Even if you're not aware of it, I'm sure there's something your heart of hearts wishes for.
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone."
5790,Choice 1: I do.
5791,Choice 2: I do not.
5792,"Choice 3: More of a hope...
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
Claude: Even if you're not aware of it, I'm sure there's something your heart of hearts wishes for.
Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone."
5793,Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
5794,"Claude: Even if you're not aware of it, I'm sure there's something your heart of hearts wishes for."
5795,Claude: That's what I thought. It's the same for everyone.
5796,"Claude: No one is ever completely satisfied. Everyone has something they long for. Otherwise, what's the point of it all? Of course, same goes for me. Without even realizing it, I found myself holding tight to some pretty big ambitions. If you would... I would love for you to share in those ambitions with me, Teach."
5797,"Claude: But all that aside, let's get started. Let's pray to the goddess before she tuckers out for the evening. OK... Here goes. Oh, divine Goddess! Hear our prayers! We beseech you and your radiance! Please, grant us that which we seek!"
5798,"Claude: Huh. I think that should do it. The goddess'll make our dreams come true now, yeah?"
5799,Byleth: I wonder.
5800,"Claude: At any rate, we've done all we can. Whether we actually believe our dreams will come true or not is up to us."
5801,"Claude: I suppose we should head back soon. I'm sure everyone is looking for you. Just promise to spare a dance for me. OK, Teach? I swear, so long as it's not one of those goofy noble dances, I am a treasure on the dance floor!"
5802,"Lorenz: Ah. There you are, Professor. I didn’t see you at the ball. I was wondering where you’d slipped off to. Everyone is waiting for you. Shouldn’t you be heading back?"
5803,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Momentarily.
Choice 2: No, I’d like to stay here."
5804,Choice 1: Momentarily.
5805,"Choice 2: No, I’d like to stay here."
5806,"Lorenz: Well, there’s no need to hurry. The ball will continue a while longer. Was the noise becoming too much? It must be difficult, if you are unaccustomed to high society. I say that, but I’m actually the same. After a while of excitement, I yearn for peace and quiet."
5807,Byleth: Did someone turn you down?
5808,"Lorenz: Professor! Rude! Just what do you think of me? There are definitely students in there making the most of things. Flirting as if their very lives depended on it. But for a catch such as myself, every day is an opportunity. There’s no need to appear desperate. Still, it’s unexpected that the two of us would be here together, isn’t it?"
5809,Byleth: Why is that?
5810,"Lorenz: Do you not know the legend of this place? The goddess is said to grant a special kind of blessing, unique to the day of this ball. It is said that on this day she will honor any vow sworn between man and woman here at this tower. It’s a famous legend amongst the students, which may be why I expected to find more of them here."
5811,"Byleth: So, you came here to spy on people?"
5812,"Lorenz: Of course not! I would never stoop to such despicable behavior! Honestly, I forgot all about the legend until now. I’m not interested in that sort of foolishness. Though I suppose it couldn’t hurt to test it. Even if it is only a legend. What do you say, Professor? Shall we swear some sort of vow together? Something that will benefit the both of us. What dream should we promise to make a reality?"
5813,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Peace for all.
Choice 2: Happiness for the two of us."
5814,Choice 1: Peace for all.
5815,Choice 2: Happiness for the two of us.
5816,"Lorenz: That’s very fitting. I will remember that we made this vow here today. Well, I should head back. Lest, by my absence, the festivities lose their luster."
5817,Raphael: (eating) Omm… Mmm… Mmm… Huh? Who’s there?!
5818,"Raphael: P-Professor! Is the ball over already? What, uh… What are you doing here?"
5819,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Just taking a break.
Raphael: Ah, a break. Sure, sure. That's uh... That's what I'm doing too.
Choice 2: I heard a strange noise.
Raphael: Strange noise? No need to worry! I’ll, uh… I’ll look into it for you!"
5820,"Choice 1: Just taking a break.
Raphael: Ah, a break. Sure, sure. That's uh... That's what I'm doing too."
5821,"Raphael: Ah, a break. Sure, sure. That's uh... That's what I'm doing too."
5822,"Choice 2: I heard a strange noise.
Raphael: Strange noise? No need to worry! I’ll, uh… I’ll look into it for you!"
5823,"Raphael: Strange noise? No need to worry! I’ll, uh… I’ll look into it for you!"
5824,Raphael: Huh. I suddenly have the energy to dance! Maybe I’ll head back to the ball.
5825,Byleth: What were you eating?
5826,"Raphael: Ah! You noticed. It was just some meat. It was a much nicer cut than I’m used to. We all got one helping, but some people didn’t want theirs! Can you believe it? I hate to see good food go to waste. I’m sorry, Professor."
5827,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should be.
Choice 2: You need to follow the rules."
5828,Choice 1: You should be.
5829,Choice 2: You need to follow the rules.
5830,"Raphael: You’re right. I know… Oh! By the way! I heard something on my way here. I heard that if two people make a wish together in this tower, on this night, the goddess will grant it!"
5831,Byleth: Two people?
5832,"Raphael: I don’t know the specifics, just that you can’t do it alone. There has to be two of you. Since we’re both here now, let’s make a wish together! What should we wish for? More delicious cuts of meat?"
5833,Raphael: No? Then how about bigger muscles?
5834,"Raphael: What else is there to wish for? Hm! Me becoming a proper knight? But that’s just for me, not you…"
5835,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can wish for that. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: We can? Professor! That’s so generous of you!
(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)
Raphael: Now that we wished for it, I’m sure I’ll become a proper knight!
Choice 2: Let’s wish for peace in Fódlan.
Raphael: Peace in Fódlan? That's a good wish too!
(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)
Raphael: I really hope our wish comes true."
5836,"Choice 1: We can wish for that. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: We can? Professor! That’s so generous of you!
(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)

5837,Raphael: We can? Professor! That’s so generous of you!
5838,(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)
5839,"Raphael: Now that we wished for it, I’m sure I’ll become a proper knight!"
5840,"Choice 2: Let’s wish for peace in Fódlan.
Raphael: Peace in Fódlan? That's a good wish too!
(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)
Raphael: I really hope our wish comes true."
5841,Raphael: Peace in Fódlan? That's a good wish too!
5842,(Raphael briefly closes his eyes to pray)
5843,Raphael: I really hope our wish comes true.
5844,Ignatz: …
5845,"Ignatz: Gah! Is that you, Goddess?! Professor! Ah. I’m sorry, I thought you were the goddess."
5846,Byleth: That’s ridiculous.
5847,"Ignatz: You’re right, you’re right. Imagine, if she just appeared out of nowhere! Do you know of that old legend, Professor?"
5848,Byleth: Old legend?
5849,"Ignatz: Yes. It’s said that if a man and a woman make a vow tonight at the Goddess Tower… She will appear before them and bless them, ensuring that vow’s fulfillment."
5850,Byleth: Ridiculous.
5851,"Ignatz: I know, but can you imagine if she just appeared out of nowhere? Still… Maybe, even if we can’t see her, we can sense her presence. I envision the goddess as the most beautiful creature in the world… More beautiful than any landscape, any artwork. Utterly beyond compare. That’s what I think anyway. Or perhaps, what I hope. Since I first heard that legend, I’ve wanted to try it and perhaps meet the goddess."
5852,Byleth: But if the legend’s true…
5853,"Ignatz: Yes, I know what you’re getting at. She would never appear before a single person. Frankly, I didn’t know any girls well enough to invite them here. So I was hoping a couple would come along, and I could sneak a peek… Wait! That came out wrong! I take that back. I have absolutely no intention of peeking!"
5854,Byleth: Shall we make a vow?
5855,"Ignatz: What? You and...me? I suppose we do fit the criteria, but are you certain you would want to do that?"
5856,"Ignatz: In that case, let’s try it! What should our vow be? Please, pick whatever sounds best to you!"
5857,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Peace for Fódlan.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!
Choice 2: Happiness for all.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!
Choice 3: May you live your life honestly. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Oh? Oh! I see! Yes, that's a wonderful vow."
5858,"Choice 1: Peace for Fódlan.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!"
5859,"Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!"
5860,"Choice 2: Happiness for all.
Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!"
5861,"Ignatz: Of course. Might be a little ambitious, but let’s give it a try!"
5862,"Choice 3: May you live your life honestly. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Oh? Oh! I see! Yes, that's a wonderful vow."
5863,"Ignatz: Oh? Oh! I see! Yes, that's a wonderful vow."
5864,"Ignatz: Now, let us pray."
5865,Ignatz: …
5866,Ignatz: Did you feel that?! I think the goddess is near!
5867,Byleth: Still ridiculous.
5868,"Ignatz: You’re right, of course."
5869,Lysithea: Professor?
5870,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I saw you wandering off to this tower. I thought you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside.
Choice 2: Actually, I'm a ghost.
Lysithea: Don't toy with me like that, Professor! I know it's you. I figured you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside."
5871,"Choice 1: Yes? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I saw you wandering off to this tower. I thought you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside."
5872,"Lysithea: I saw you wandering off to this tower. I thought you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside."
5873,"Choice 2: Actually, I'm a ghost.
Lysithea: Don't toy with me like that, Professor! I know it's you. I figured you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside."
5874,"Lysithea: Don't toy with me like that, Professor! I know it's you. I figured you might be lost or something, so I followed you inside."
5875,Lysithea: Everyone seems to be looking for you. You're surprisingly popular.
5876,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That surprises you, does it? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I do find it surprising, yes. Particularly your popularity with the ladies.
Choice 2: Naturally.
Lysithea: Despite your confidence, I'm still surprised by your popularity with the ladies."
5877,"Choice 1: That surprises you, does it? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I do find it surprising, yes. Particularly your popularity with the ladies."
5878,"Lysithea: I do find it surprising, yes. Particularly your popularity with the ladies."
5879,"Choice 2: Naturally.
Lysithea: Despite your confidence, I'm still surprised by your popularity with the ladies."
5880,"Lysithea: Despite your confidence, I'm still surprised by your popularity with the ladies."
5881,"Lysithea: It isn't like you're very sociable, after all. Not to be rude, mind you."
5882,Byleth: How do you fare in such matters?
5883,"Lysithea: Er, I wouldn't know, to be honest. I have no interest in such things. The academy is for honing one's skills. Not for frivolous romances, despite what the other students may think. I overheard them gossiping about a place where a man and a woman can make a vow, and it is certain it will come to pass. Seems to be some folktale they enjoy. I wonder where this ""place"" is..."
5884,Byleth: The Goddess Tower?
5885,"Lysithea: Oh, of course! I recall now. It's— Wait. That's... That's here, isn't it?! Uh, just to be clear, this is pure coincidence. I didn't follow you for...for that. But we are here alone, so people may wonder what our aim is. Let's get out of here before someone sees us and gets the wrong idea!"
5886,Byleth: There's no need for panic.
5887,"Lysithea: Are you saying you don't mind if someone sees us and thinks… Oh, I suppose you believe there's no danger of that, since it's just me. You're treating me like a child, aren't you? Well, I don't mind either, then. Obviously there's nothing going on here. If you're going stick to around until we collect dust, then so will I!"
5888,Lysithea: …
5889,"Lysithea: Actually, I'm gonna go now. Don't you stay too long either! You'll catch your death of cold out here."
5890,"Marianne: Please be patient! I'll be done with my prayer in a moment... Dear Goddess, I beg thee… Oh! Professor?"
5891,Byleth: Is someone else here?
5892,"Marianne: No... I'm the only one here. Umm… Well, more accurately, I'm the only human present. My bird friend is here as well."
5893,Byleth: You're talking to a bird?
5894,"Marianne: No! Well. It's more like the bird is...doing me a favor. They say if a man and a woman pray here, on this night, their wish will come true. At least, that's how the legend goes."
5895,Byleth: And the bird?
5896,"Marianne: It's a pigeon. A...male pigeon. At least, I think so. I thought he might count as a man."
5897,Marianne: …
5898,Byleth: …
5899,"Marianne: Well, I'd better be leaving. It seems my pigeon friend got impatient and flew away."
5900,Byleth: I'm sorry...
5901,"Marianne: No, it's fine. The goddess probably wouldn't accept a male pigeon anyway."
5902,Byleth: I'll take his place.
5903,"Marianne: Oh? Um. Are you saying you'll pray with me, Professor?"
5904,Byleth: …
5905,"Marianne: Thank you! If you have a wish for the future, let's pray for it, OK?"
5906,Byleth: What is your wish?
5907,"Marianne: Who, me? Oh, nothing in particular. Let's pray for your wish. There must be something you want. Well?"
5908,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Peace in Fódlan.
Marianne: Very well. Let us pray.
Choice 2: Only to see you smile.
Marianne: Hey, no need to tease me..."
5909,"Choice 1: Peace in Fódlan.
Marianne: Very well. Let us pray."
5910,Marianne: Very well. Let us pray.
5911,"Choice 2: Only to see you smile.
Marianne: Hey, no need to tease me..."
5912,"Marianne: Hey, no need to tease me..."
5913,"Marianne: Professor? I must be going now, but...I'm glad I ran into you."
5914,"Hilda: Professor! You're not waiting for anyone, right? Thought so! I bet you've never heard the legend about this tower then."
5915,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I haven't...
Choice 2: What legend?"
5916,Choice 1: I haven't...
5917,Choice 2: What legend?
5918,"Hilda: Something special happens here during the Ethereal Moon, on the night of the ball. First, an unmarried boy and girl need to meet at the Goddess Tower and make a vow. Then, the goddess will grant them divine protection, and ensure that their vow comes true. Or so they say! It's a well-known story among the students. A couple guys invited me up here, but..."
5919,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You turned them down?
Hilda: Yes, I did.
Choice 2: They stood you up?
Hilda: No! How rude. I turned them down."
5920,"Choice 1: You turned them down?
Hilda: Yes, I did."
5921,"Hilda: Yes, I did."
5922,"Choice 2: They stood you up?
Hilda: No! How rude. I turned them down."
5923,Hilda: No! How rude. I turned them down.
5924,"Hilda: If I accepted their invitations, then our vow would come true. It's just a legend, sure...but I prefer to be cautious about such things. One of the guys was pretty handsome, and he came from a good family... But that doesn't really tell you what a person's like on the inside. I want a life partner who's good-hearted and good-looking. Anyway, I went for a walk and happened upon you, and I thought... ""The professor's perfect. Why don't I just make a vow with him?"" Hah! I'm just kidding, Professor. To be honest, I wanted to spy on you. See if you had someone else up here. Although, if you did want to make a vow with me, I wouldn't object. Need some time to consider?"
5925,Byleth: Yes. Let's revisit this tomorrow morning.
5926,"Hilda: Hang on! It won't mean anything tomorrow! Oh, I get it! Everyone's looking for you down there, girls included. You don't want to keep them waiting. You're pretty smooth, you know that? Well, I'm off, then. I'll see you at the ball. Ah... Did the goddess hear that conversation?"
5927,"Leonie: Hey, Professor. You all alone here? I mean, you're not waiting for anyone or anything, are you?"
5928,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Actually, I'm meeting the archbishop.
Leonie: Liar. I saw Lady Rhea just moments ago. She was in the reception hall.
Choice 2: Manuela should be here any moment.
Leonie: Yeah, right! I just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up."
5929,"Choice 1: Actually, I'm meeting the archbishop.
Leonie: Liar. I saw Lady Rhea just moments ago. She was in the reception hall."
5930,Leonie: Liar. I saw Lady Rhea just moments ago. She was in the reception hall.
5931,"Choice 2: Manuela should be here any moment.
Leonie: Yeah, right! I just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up."
5932,"Leonie: Yeah, right! I just passed her flirting with some guy on my way up."
5933,"Leonie: Anyway, I saw you heading to the tower, so I thought I'd drop by. I figured you might be lonely."
5934,"Byleth: You figured that, did you?"
5935,"Leonie: Hey, don't make it weird! By the way... Have you heard the legend about this place? They say if a guy and a girl make a promise here together, the goddess will make sure it's kept."
5936,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've heard.
Leonie: It's a pretty well-known legend.
Choice 2: I had not heard that.
Leonie: Really? It's a pretty well-known legend."
5937,"Choice 1: I've heard.
Leonie: It's a pretty well-known legend."
5938,Leonie: It's a pretty well-known legend.
5939,"Choice 2: I had not heard that.
Leonie: Really? It's a pretty well-known legend."
5940,Leonie: Really? It's a pretty well-known legend.
5941,"Leonie: Thing is, the way the story goes, it doesn't work all the time. It has to be the night of the ball. Tonight. So, since it's just you and me here, what do you say we give it a go? I mean, I don't know if the goddess will really take the time for a pair like us, but it's worth a try."
5942,Byleth: What are you suggesting?
5943,"Leonie: Well—you know! Let's make some kind of promise! We've got the chance, it'd be a shame to waste it. I mean, not something romantic or anything. That'd be weird. We could promise I'll become a top-tier mercenary! Though I guess that's more of a wish… Let's see... OK, I've got it. I solemnly swear to meet you once more, on this very ground, as a mercenary beyond compare! Oh, but that was all about me. No fair. You probably have something you want to promise too."
5944,"Byleth: No, I think that covers it."
5945,"Leonie: Hah. You really do take after Captain Jeralt—always putting others first. All right, then, Goddess. You heard the promise. It's a done deal. Say, Professor...why did you come out here, anyway?"
5946,Byleth: I just wanted some time alone.
5947,"Leonie: Ah. Well, it is pretty crowded down there. I guess I shouldn't have interrupted. I'll leave you to it. But don't stay out here too long, all right? You'll catch a cold!"
5948,Flayn: Professor? Is that you over there? It seems both of us were curious about this place.
5949,Byleth: What are you talking about?
5950,"Flayn: Oh, perhaps I was mistaken. I figured you had come to this tower after having heard the legend."
5951,Byleth: What legend?
5952,"Flayn: You've not heard of it, then? I suppose I only recently learned of it myself, from a friend. Legend tells that on the night of a ball, when a man and woman pledge vows at this very tower… The goddess will bestow her blessing, ensuring those vows come to pass. Of course, such things do not really come to pass. But there are many who place stock in this legend. I wondered what sort of vows youths tend to pledge... So here I am, hoping to gain deeper understanding. Only to bump into you! Are you meeting someone here, perchance?"
5953,"Byleth: No, I'm not."
5954,"Flayn: That's unfortunate. I wonder if anyone else will be coming… Professor? If the legend were true, what type of vow might you pledge?"
5955,Byleth: It's hard to say…
5956,Flayn: No ideas? Perhaps your imagination is lacking due to the lack of a partner. What say you to being my partner? How about sharing a vow with me? I'll give you until the count of three to come up with something heartfelt and honorable. One...two...three! Go ahead!
5957,"Byleth:
Choice 1: May we always be together.
Choice 2: May we both find joy."

5960,"Flayn: Oh! You made my heart flutter! I see. This is the type of vow one would make to another. You've taught me well, as a professor should. I'm most certainly wiser and more mature than I was, even just moments ago. Oh dear. What if the goddess really did hear your vow? Although...I suppose I would not mind if that turned out to be the case. I bid you good evening."
5961,"Sothis: Running away? I understand. You hardly had the time to breathe in there. It must be hard to be the favourite teacher at the ball! Poor, poor Professor!"

Sothis: Was that a joke? I find it hard to tell with you. Just think of all the students begging you to dance!

5976,Choice 2: As a child?
5977,"Dimitri: I've told you before we're siblings by marriage, haven't I? Her birth mother was my stepmother, although I didn't know that at the time. My stepmother treated me with such kindness...just as though I were her own flesh and blood. And yet she never so much as hinted that she had her own child...Edelgard. We were born and raised in different territories, without ever knowing the other even existed. Yet, against all odds, for just over a year, we became childhood friends."

Choice 1: Friends?
Choice 2: Not siblings?"
5979,Choice 1: Friends?
5980,Choice 2: Not siblings?
5981,"Dimitri: Indeed. Unaware of each other's stations or backgrounds, we met and became incredibly close. This was when she and Lord Arundel were living in the Kingdom."
5982,Byleth: Why were they in the Kingdom?
5983,"Dimitri: They were in exile... This was a time of great turmoil within the Empire. I ran into her when visiting Lord Arundel's residence with my father. She seemed...quite bored. With everything. At first I found her to be difficult and stubborn, but that facade quickly fell away, revealing her true self beneath... That's around the time when she taught me how to dance. Her instruction was... Oh, let's call it strict. To put it nicely."
5984,"Young Edelgard: Wrong foot, Dimitri! You're supposed to lead with your right!"
5985,"Young Dimitri: El, the sun's going down! I really oughta be heading home..."
5986,"Dimitri: That one year before she had to return to the Empire was...so much fun. The time of my life, in many ways."
5987,"Dimitri: It's kind of pathetic to think about it all these years later, but can you guess what I gave her as a parting gift?"
5988,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Flowers?
Choice 2: A book?
Dimitri: No, that makes too much sense. Actually, I gave her a dagger! You should have seen the look on her face!

5993,"Dimitri: Huh. Good guess, Professor. But I swear, it came from the heart."
5994,"Dimitri: In Faerghus, we've long considered blades as tools of destiny. As a way to cut a path to a better future. She was being dragged all over, unable to live the life she wanted. I thought the dagger could help her cut out a path to the future she dreamed of. However...that was many years ago. I'm sure she's forgotten all about the boy I was back then."
5995,Byleth It's not too late to reconnect.
5996,Dimitri: I'm afraid it's far too late for that. Things are different now. She's different. I'm different. (Dimitri turns away) Anyway... I'm feeling a bit out of place here. Festivities like this don't suit me.
5997,Dimitri: Professor... Will you join me for a bit? You must be getting a bit tired of the ball by now.
5998,"Dimitri: Still, I suppose I should get back in there. Good-bye, Professor."
5999,Sothis: But where is there to run? This place is filled with joyful students looking for a dance.
6000,Sothis: Ah... I see. The Goddess Tower waits for you...
6001,Sothis: It seems that everyone is having a delightful time. Will you not dance some more?

6006,"Sothis: Ah, you're not the only one who feels that way. Look over there."
6007,Rhea: ...
6008,Sothis: Hmph. I'm bored beyond compare. Will you not follow her?

6011,Choice 2: I have no reason to. (Relationship with Sothis down)
6012,"Sothis: Oh, come on! Hurry up! I know that you are curious to see what she is up to... I hear...someone singing. From other there..."
6013,"Rhea: (singing) ♪ In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight... ♪"
6014,"Sothis: That song... I feel I have heard it in the past... Actually... It is not that I have heard it. I... Did I once sing that song to someone? No. There's more. I wrote this song... Oh, but how could that be so? If that were true, then how could she be singing it? Unless... No, no. I am suddenly so exhausted... As are you, no doubt? Quickly then. To bed with you."
6015,"Alois: Captain? Captain! Where are you? Hey, Professor. Have you seen your old man?"
6016,"Alois: Too bad. I guess it will have to be you, then..."
6017,"Jeralt: I'm back. Sorry for the delay, my last mission took longer than expected."
6018,Alois: Captain! Thank goodness you're here. There are reports of Demonic Beasts near the chapel!
6019,Jeralt: Nonsense. I haven't heard anything about the monastery's walls being breached.
6020,"Alois: That's why I'm heading there now, to see what's really going on. You'll join as well, won't you?"
6021,Jeralt: Of course. We're both sworn to protect this place.
6022,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Where did they come from?
Choice 2: Demonic Beasts?"
6023,Choice 1: Where did they come from?
6024,Choice 2: Demonic Beasts?
6025,"Alois: It's odd. Just before they appeared, someone saw a number of students heading toward the chapel. They were apparently acting strange, as though they weren't in their right minds. Shortly after, Demonic Beasts started to appear, one after the other."
6026,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are the students safe?
Choice 2: Were the students killed?"
6027,Choice 1: Are the students safe?
6028,Choice 2: Were the students killed?
6029,Jeralt: Hm... The students... There's no way those Demonic Beasts got in from the outside... But none of that matters right now. We need to act. Go summon your students.
6030,"Jeralt: Damn it... I wanted to talk to you about something important, but there's no time. There's never any damn time. But this is much more urgent, so it can hold for now. I'll meet you there."
6031,Suggested Level: 17
6032,Victory Conditions: Rout the enemy.

6036,"Jeralt: There really are Demonic Beasts here... They're emerging from the chapel! I'll head that way. The rest of you, protect the students who weren't able to get away."
6037,Student (South-west corner): Help me! These beasts... They're...
6038,Student (North-west corner): Argh! Somebody help me!
6039,Student (North-east corner): You stupid beasts! Don't you dare come over here!
6040,Jeralt: That beast... There's a stone or something on its forehead...
6041,Monica: ...
6042,"Jeralt: Do you really think you can keep going? Don't push yourself too hard. Thinking about what happened in Remire village, it's clear you've gotten the hang of being a leader. Maybe you should have taken command of me too!"
6043,Student: ...
6044,Jeralt: The Demonic Beasts were actually students? How can this be...
6045,Student: Thank you! But my friends who couldn't get away... Are they OK?
6046,"Student: I was so scared... I'll find a way to repay you, I promise!"
6047,Student: Sorry. That was a close one...
6048,Student: Phew... You saved me. Thank you!
6049,Jeralt: There isn't a trace of evidence to be found in the chapel. This must have been something to do with Remire. Perhaps...
6050,Monica: Wait!
6051,Jeralt: Huh? Another student?
6052,Jeralt: Run along now.
6053,"Monica: Thanks for all your help, sir."
6054,Monica: You're just a pathetic old man. How dare you get in the way of my brilliant plan...you dog.
6055,Jeralt: Run along now.
6056,"Monica: Thanks for all your help, sir."
6057,Monica: Huh? What are you doing here?
6058,Thales: You must survive. Merely because there is a role that I require you to fulfill.
6059,Jeralt: Sorry. It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now.
6060,"Jeralt: To think that the first time I saw you cry...your tears would be for me. It's sad, and yet...I'm happy for it. Thank you...kid."
6061,"Sothis: So this is where your father lived... Hm? Are you still crying? If turning back the hands of time was not enough to save his life, you must accept what came to pass was fate."
6062,"Byleth
Choice 1: It wasn't fate.
Sothis: Control yourself. Though Jeralt's death was at the hands of wicked ones, a fate is still a fate.
Choice 2: Our enemies will pay.
Sothis: Agreed. We cannot let the wicked ones run free."
6063,"Choice 1: It wasn't fate.

6066,Sothis: Agreed. We cannot let the wicked ones run free.
6067,Sothis: Oh! Your father said to look for something here. He must be referring to whatever is behind that bookcase there...
6068,"Sothis: Your father's diary... Huh, his handwriting is prettier than his face would suggest. Well, well! These entries here are from before your birth. He seems to have been writing this for quite some time. Hm? Ah... Read that part there. Horsebow Moon, Year 1159..."
6069,"Jeralt's voice: Day 20 of the Horsebow Moon. All is cloudy. I can't believe she's dead. Lady Rhea said she died during childbirth. But is that the truth? And still, the child she traded her life for doesn't make a sound. Didn't even cry at birth."
6070,"Day 25 of the Horsebow Moon. It's raining. The baby doesn't laugh or cry. Not ever. Lady Rhea says not to worry, but a baby that doesn't cry...isn't natural. Had a doctor examine the child in secret. He said the pulse is normal, but there's no heartbeat. No heartbeat!"
6071,Day 2 of the Wyvern Moon. Sunny. I feel I must take the child and leave. But the church is always watching us... I don't know what Lady Rhea has planned. I used to think the world of Lady Rhea. Now I'm terrified of her.
6072,Day 8 of the Wyvern Moon. More rain. I used the fire that broke out last night to fake the child's death. Lady Rhea is in a state over the news. But I can't change what I've done. I've got to take the child and leave...
6073,Sothis: Well now! That baby must be you! That means... Hm? Someone is approaching us.
6074,"Dimitri: There you are. Lady Rhea is looking for you, Professor. And after your audience, why don't you join me at the dining hall? You haven't eaten since...since it happened. Have you?"
6075,Byleth: ...
6076,Dimitri: Forgive me... I suppose it's too soon to try and coax you back into the normal swing of things. As for what happened to Jeralt... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't do anything to stop it. Stay here until you've found some peace. I'll cover for you with Lady Rhea and everyone else.
6077,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thank you.
Dimitri: We'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready to return to us.
Choice 2: If only.
Dimitri: No need to put on a brave face. No one would blame you for taking time for yourself."
6078,"Choice 1: Thank you.
Dimitri: We'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready to return to us."
6079,Dimitri: We'll be waiting for you whenever you're ready to return to us.
6080,"Choice 2: If only.
Dimitri: No need to put on a brave face. No one would blame you for taking time for yourself."
6081,Dimitri: No need to put on a brave face. No one would blame you for taking time for yourself.
6082,"Dimitri: I don't believe it's a sign of strength to just keep going forward no matter what. Taking the time to grieve for those we've lost...there's strength in that too. That's what I think, anyway. That said... It's also important to remember that no matter how sad you are, eventually your tears will dry up. That's when you have to figure out what it is you're living for. Then you can cling to that, with all your might, and start moving forward again."
6083,Byleth: What I'm living for?
6084,"Dimitri: Four years ago, in Duscur, I experienced the same pain you're feeling now. My father...was the strongest man I knew. Someone I loved and admired deeply. That day, he was killed before my eyes. His head severed clean off. My stepmother, the kindest person I had ever known, left me behind and disappeared into the infernal flames. Everyone who I considered precious...my family and my closest friends...I couldn't save any of them. Not a single one. Now, the burden of the work they left behind falls on me. I must ensure they have no regrets. That's my duty, as the sole survivor of the tragedy. It's a heavy burden, but accepting it gave me the strength to pick myself up off the ground and start moving again. Start living again. Jeralt is gone... So, what will you do now, Professor? What must you do? Look deep in your heart and I'm certain you'll find the answer there...indelible and inescapable. I've probably bothered you enough for today, but I have just one more thought to leave you with. Even now, Seteth is gathering the knights to begin a full scale search for the enemy. It may not be right away, but before long they will find their trail. No matter what happens or what anyone may say, know that I plan to stand by you, Professor. Through anything. Until the bitter end."
6085,"Sothis: Well? Did you search deep within yourself as he suggested? And did you find yourself some answers? This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined..."
6086,Alois: Ah... Here you are. To think that Captain... that Jeralt would meet his end like that. I hope you know that you were the most important thing in the world to him.
6087,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I was? (Relationship with Alois up)
Choice 2: What do you want?"
6088,Choice 1: I was? (Relationship with Alois up)
6089,Choice 2: What do you want?
6090,"Alois: He wasn't the most emotional guy. I'm sure expressing his affection wouldn't have come naturally to him. After what's happened, it's up to me now. I, Alois, swear to protect you in the captain's stead. (sighs) Sorry. This isn't the time for my blathering. Lady Rhea is looking for you. I came to tell you that. I'll take my leave now."
6091,"Sothis: This book is filled with secrets yet unknown. We must return another time to read the rest. Oh, but I have at least figured one thing out. I know now why our fates are intertwined..."
6092,Rhea: Professor. I have been waiting for you. I am filled with grief at the loss of our most celebrated knight. Jeralt was an ally of many years...and also a dear friend.

Byleth
Choice 1: Many years?
Choice 2: When did you meet?
Rhea: It was a long while back. At the time, Jeralt was a soldier of the Kingdom. He was injured in battle, and I saved him just as he was about to perish. That was our first meeting. After that, he became a Knight of Seiros. He gave his all to the service of the church.

6107,"Rhea: Very well. Professor, you are dismissed for the day. Please rest and focus only on mending your heart. Understood?"
6108,"Long ago, the guardian Seiros made an appearance during this moon. She had been summoned by the goddess, whose soul was suffering as the flames of war raged across Fódlan. Some believe that high in the sky above Seiros, the Immaculate One's mighty wings are what powered the strong winds carrying the guardian and her forces into battle.

Or will you just sit here with no thought for the future that is fast approaching? My teacher... There is a choice to be made. I hope you make the right one."
6193,"Sothis: My, my. She really is quite arrogant. She spoke her mind without an ounce of reservation! But she is right. The time has come to stand again. You already know what your answer is."
6194,"Monica: Oh, thank you. You saved me!"
6195,"Thales: If you were to die, then the mystery of our bodies would be revealed. Preventing that was my only aim. I'm afraid you must remain, Kronya. There is something I need you to do."
6196,"Monica: Oh, of course. I am always happy to cooperate with Solon. Leave it to me."
6197,Flame Emperor: How annoying.
6198,"Thales: Flame Emperor... Is she offending you? Unfortunately, we cannot take our eyes off her, so there is nothing to be done. You are our greatest creation. We used the defiled beast's blood as the fuel to your flame, that you may burn even the gods. Now is the time to cleanse Fódlan of that power, and bring forth our salvation."
6199,Flame Emperor: There will be no salvation for you and your kind. Those responsible for such gruesome deeds in Duscur and Enbarr.
6200,Thales: All so that you may acquire the strength you need. All for a purpose...
6201,"Sothis: What are you going at this hour? Ooh, I know... You are eavesdropping! I must admit that I approve."
6202,Dimitri: Professor? We must remain quiet...
6203,Sothis: I see... The Flame Emperor and Monica...and the mage who rescued Monica.

6224,"Thales: Hmph. Even if someone has overhead us, there is nothing they can do. There have always been rats in the walls, and there always will be."

6229,Choice 2: What about the dagger?
6230,"Dimitri: It...no. Never mind. It couldn't possibly be so. Professor, those are the ones we must destroy. They're the bastards who killed my family and Jeralt. For now, let's return to the monastery and regroup. As for the Flame Emperor's dagger...I'll hold on to it for the time being."
6231,"Sothis: ""Day 5 of the Garland Moon. I picked some flowers for her and returned home."" ""The look of joy on her face at the sight of these flowers will be even more beautiful than the flowers themselves…"" Yeesh! That is enough. His entries from before your birth are full of such romantic blatherings as that. Oh… It must be deeply moving you to hear such things, but now is not the time for whimsy. Someone is here. You do not wish for them to see you in this state. So pull yourself together!"
6232,"Claude: I thought I might find you here, Teach. Not the type to wallow in solitude, eh? That's a relief, let me tell you. So… What were you reading? Is that Jeralt's…"
6233,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Diary.
Claude: So it is.

6238,"Claude: Hey, maybe this has some entries from when Jeralt left the monastery."
6239,"Claude: Is that so… He was the captain of the knights, but something made him leave the monastery in a hurry. If it has something to do with your birth, knowing what happened may get us closer to knowing what secrets the church is hiding… Teach… Would you mind letting me read that diary? I know how important it is to you, but I'm not asking lightly. Please, allow me to borrow it."
6240,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You may borrow it.
Claude: I'm forever in your debt, Teach. If you'd refused, I would've had to sneak in here in the dead of night. I wasn't looking forward to that prospect. Anyway, let me fill you in on what's been going on lately, and not just as thanks for pointing me to that diary.
Choice 2: I can't allow it.

That has me wondering… If you find out where the enemy is, what will you do about it? If you ask, I… No, scratch that. All of us students would gladly lend a hand. Even if it means going against Rhea's wishes. Don't forget it. Now go. Everyone's worried about you. You'd better show them you're in good spirits."

6259,"Edelgard: Professor, I'm so happy to see you. You're finally returning to your old self. To see the light in your eyes again is a gift. It inspires me to carry on as well. As you know, the knights are searching furiously for any trace of the enemies who escaped. I'll inform you immediately if I learn anything relevant."
6260,"Edelgard: What happened to Jeralt... It's terrible. If there's anything I can do, simply ask. Even if what you desire is revenge...I'll gladly lend you my power. We can't let them get away with this."
6261,Dimitri: Professor! Welcome back... I was... We all were... (sighs) You've been on our minds. Know that your enemies are my enemies. I will do all I can to help you find justice. There is no one else I can... My strength is yours alone. I will fight as you command... I will kill anyone should you ask it of me.
6262,"Dimitri: I'm so sorry about what happened to Jeralt... No...of course my sorrow is nothing compared to yours. The knights are even now searching for our enemies' whereabouts. They are to report back the moment they find something. If you desire revenge, Professor...you can count me in."
6263,"Claude: Hi, Teach. I see the storm in your eyes has passed… You're looking much better. I've been reading Jeralt's diary. The baby he mentions… That's you, isn't it? I can't understand about half of what's written on here… But Jeralt really cherished you. That much is clear."
6264,"Claude: I haven't lost a parent yet, so I can't even begin to understand how you must be feeling... But even while you're standing still, the world keeps on moving. I always find that oddly comforting."
6265,"Hubert: I've never been much for condolences. How about a little logic, instead? The knights have spread out around Garreg Mach in search of Jeralt's murderers. Thus, the monastery's fighting strength is, for the moment at least, depleted. Perhaps that was the enemy's real objective. We should be prepared for further confrontation."
6266,Hubert: I've never been much for condolences.
6267,"Petra: Professor, please lend us your ears. Ferdinand is saying impossible things."
6268,"Ferdinand: I do not see what is impossible about it. All I said was that if you want to go back to Brigid, you probably can. You are...the Empire's guest, so to speak. They cannot afford for something bad to happen to you. There would be a diplomatic incident. Someone close to us has turned up dead, so one could argue that you're not safe here anymore."
6269,"Petra: You were already told! I am learning here, from the academy. What are you thinking, Professor?"
6270,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You do not have to leave if you do not wish it. (Relationship with Petra up)

6273,Petra: I am not returning to home until I have grabbed my goal! I will not be listening to the words of Ferdinand.
6274,"Ferdinand: No, look, I did not mean to pressure you. Apologies for the misunderstanding."
6275,"Linhardt: I slipped quietly into the vault and rummaged about, looking for anything we might find useful. There is a group of people who want to kill us, after all. What? This is no time for asking permission. I learned long ago that one can ask permission or forgiveness. It is rarely useful to request the former. Still, it appears that the knights have already taken everything useful. There were Crest-related objects I thought might be worth studying, so– There you go again with that stern look. Of course I'll put them back when I'm done. Assuming they bear no additional use."
6276,"Caspar: I'm not even close to being strong enough. I mean, Jeralt was so much stronger than me, but even he... That's enough. I can't dwell on the past. There's no way to know what my future holds but I do know one thing. Whatever happens, I have to make my own way in this world. I have to keep pushing so I can grow even stronger!"
6277,"Bernadetta: Professor? I, um, I brought some flowers for Jeralt."
6278,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thank you. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)

6284,Dorothea: I've sung lyrics lamenting death many times on stage... But when something like this happens in real life... I'm lost. I don't know what to say. But I do know this much... Sir Jeralt must have been very proud to have you as his child.
6285,Dedue: It is a shame what happened to Jeralt. I am sorry. There are no words. Leave some flowers on his grave for me.
6286,"Sylvain: Dark expressions don't suit you, Professor. But I'm... Well, I'm glad to see you out in the world again. It seems this month will be a quiet one around here. There aren't many knights around to liven things up."
6287,"Felix: Most of the knights are gone, seeking out the enemy."
6288,"Sylvain: Isn't that a bit much? I agree it's important, but is it a good idea to neglect the safety of the monastery?"
6289,"Felix: What do you think, Professor?"
6290,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It would be a shame if we were invaded. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: I agree. We can send some knights after our enemies, but so many? It makes the church seem reckless.
Choice 2: You're worrying too much.
Sylvain: Hopefully the knights finish their business and hurry back. I wouldn't mind having a few extra lances around."

6296,"Mercedes: I'm so glad you're OK, Professor. I was so worried!"
6297,"Annette: Oh, Professor! You must be starving. Mercie and I made some sweets for you. We were thinking that if you were to eat something sweet, it might help you feel better."
6298,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thank you for the thought. (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: Baking sweets is my specialty. I'm sure they'll do the trick.

6303,"Ingrid: I'm so sorry... I never quite know what to say at times like these... Just...don't push yourself too hard too soon. It's OK to allow yourself to be sad right now. Losing someone dear to you... Well, each loss is unique, but it's a feeling I know very well. That said... Professor, I..."
6304,"Lorenz: There is no one here who has not heard tales of Jeralt's valor. We have suffered a most dear loss. I do not know what the enemy's aim was, but I do know this–after what they have done, we cannot suffer them to live. If there is anything I can do to ensure that justice is brought swiftly, you need only give the word."
6305,"Raphael: You've gotta keep yourself active during tough times, Professor. Even if it seems impossible. That's how I got through when I lost my parents. If you need help with anything, just come and see me. Eating and training are my specialties."
6306,Ignatz: I'm scared. I feel that I don't understand the world. How could something like that happen to Jeralt? He was so strong.
6307,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even though you're scared, push through. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: You're inspiring, Professor. I""ll do my best.

6312,"Lysithea: I'm sure you will pull through this because you're so strong, Professor. Best to stay calm during such tumultuous and upsetting times. We don't know the nature of our enemies. If we underestimate them, anything could happen."
6313,"Byleth:
Choice 1: But if we don't defeat them…
Lysithea: I agree they must be defeated, but I also feel we must approach this with prudence.

6325,Marianne: I'll say a prayer for Jeralt's soul. There's not much else I can do…
6326,"Hilda: Professor, it seems like you're holding up OK, but… I'm worried about Leonie. She really loved Jeralt. I hope she can bounce back…"
6327,"Leonie: Captain Jeralt's gone. He's gone. And we'd only just reunited... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sure this is even harder on you. But I just can't– I can't believe..."
6328,"Rhea: Professor... How are you holding up? I know how heavily grief weighs upon one's heart... I lost my mother some time ago. It was... Forgive me my moment of weakness. Even all these years later, I cannot recall that time without feeling the pain as if it were brand new. Just know that I am praying for your mind and your heart to find peace."
6329,"Seteth: First Tomas, and now Monica. I do have a theory, though I admit it is nothing more than speculation. Both Tomas and Monica have each gone missing at one time or another. It was reported that when Monica returned from her disappearance, she began to act like a completely different person. As if, perhaps, the real Monica had been killed and replaced by an impostor. Thinking of it like that, it is possible that this Solon had been impersonating Tomas for some time. How they managed such a convincing change of appearance, though, I still do not understand."
6330,"Flayn: You have lost your father... Now more than ever do I understand how very lucky I am that you were able to save me. Professor, I deeply appreciate what you have done. Thank you. If there is anything at all I can do in return, please tell me, OK?"
6331,"Hanneman: You've lost someone very dear to you... I'm so... You have my sympathy. Manuela and I can take on some of your workload this month. We can't do all the teaching, but at least we can lighten the load for you. I've always seen strength in your eyes. I know you'll recover. You're a very strong person."
6332,Manuela: I have something rather uncomfortable to discuss. It's about the weapon that killed Jeralt. Will you listen?
6333,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'll listen. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: It was a dagger, but I know enough to know it wasn't an ordinary dagger. It wasn't made of iron or steel because... Well, because whatever it was, the wound it left wasn't normal. Who could make a blade like that, do you figure?
Choice 2: I won't listen.
Manuela: I see... That's probably for the best."

6339,"Cyril: Oh Goddess, hear my prayer. Please receive this beloved person. When the cold rain washes the body, when the bird and wolf announce the dawn... Receive them into your blue blood. Receive them into a twinkling star. That's a mourning scripture from the Church of Seiros. Lady Rhea taught it to me. I pray that Jeralt is happy in the next world."
6340,Anna: I heard Jeralt passed away... My deepest condolences. I knew him long before I ever even met you... He was always so much fun to be around... It's such a loss...
6341,Gatekeeper: Professor... Thank you for all you have done for us. Nothing to report today. (sobs)
6342,"Student: Um, Professor? Do you think we'll still be able to graduate? If dangerous things keep happening around here, who even knows... I'm worried. I hope that all the students and professors will be there to celebrate at the graduation ceremony..."
6343,"Student: When I heard that Monica was with the enemy, I was surprised by how unsurprised I was. Something was just off about her. It's hard to explain. That said, whenever she had free time, she was always hanging around with Edelgard. I wonder if Edelgard is also... Oh, I'm sorry! Now I'm just being paranoid. Please ignore me."
6344,"Soldier: The other night, I...I had the honor of sharing a drink with Jeralt. He was pretty tactless, honestly. He could be blunt at times. But... He always looked like such a proud, happy father whenever he spoke of you."
6345,Soldier: I trained with Jeralt just the other day... Why... Why did he have to go and die?! It's too awful! He didn't deserve it!
6346,"Priest: First Tomas and now Monica... I am so sorry. The failing was clearly our own. We didn't notice the enemy's invasion, and now Jeralt... I...I apologize. There is nothing I can say to atone for our sins. Professor, please do not let your guard down even among the people of the monastery. There is no way to know where another enemy may be hiding..."
6347,"Monk: Monica von Ochs... There is nothing suspicious in her past that would suggest this change of character. Her transformation must have something to do with her disappearance last year... Sadly, that is the extent of my knowledge. I wonder who kidnapped her and why..."
6348,"Yuri: Jeralt raised you, yeah? He was all you had... You must be feeling a lot right now. When a parent dies, it really leaves a mark. So feel what you need to, no matter how that looks. But know that your inner fire will keep you moving ahead through even the hardest times."
6349,"Balthus: Hey pal. I see you're up and at 'em again, yeah? Good on ya. No use crying over the past and all."
6350,"Constance: Balthus, have some sensitivity! Who knows what the poor dear is going through right now?"
6351,"Balthus: The ''poor dear'' can hear you, ya know. Talking about someone like they're not even there. How cold can you get?"
6352,"Constance: Ah... A fair point. Please, Professor, forgive my indiscretion. You have my condolences."
6353,"Balthus: Remember, the first step to healing is a hefty dose of revenge. Get out there and get to it!"
6354,"Hapi: Hey. It seems like you're having a hard time. Not that I can really understand what you're going through. I know this is painful, but don't lose hope for the future, OK? Someday, you'll be able to accept what's happened. And in the meantime, you have plenty of friends here to support you. Me included."
6355,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. But maybe now isn't the time? You seem down. Got something on your mind? I hope you know I'm here for you, if you ever have your own stuff to report. That's what friends are for. Unless it's about money. In which case...I'm busy."
6356,Hermit: Captain Jeralt's been killed?! I can't believe it... From all I'd heard about the man... I thought he was indestructible. He was so strong. What could have possibly─Forgive me. I shouldn't speculate.
6357,"Resident: This month feels different, doesn't it? Garreg Mach's all...tense. Like the whole place might explode. This is why I've kept to myself all these years. I don't wanna be anywhere near whatever's about to happen."
6358,"Cavalier: The Adrestian Empire's Imperial guard is looking for someone to train with. They're said to be the cream of the crop, but I'm certain you can hold your own."
6359,"Cavalier: Professor, I know it was just a training exercise, but I can still hardly believe you defeated the Imperial guard. That was thrilling! They were so impressed, in fact, that they decided to support us here at the monastery."
6360,"Edelgard: Professor! I know where the enemy is... Where Solon is. They're in a place called the Sealed Forest, close to the monastery. The archbishop is gathering the knights to begin a search. She's doing so in secret, behind our backs."
6361,Byleth: Why in secret?
6362,"Edelgard: She must be afraid that a thirst for revenge will compel you to seek them out. Now that you know, will you give us the order?"
6363,Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
6364,"Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now."
6365,Byleth: You can't stop me.
6366,"Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable."
6367,"Edelgard: Lady Rhea, our professor is not acting out of revenge. Sending us out there is the most strategic move we can make. You can't deny it. Most of the knights are still far away. Not only does our professor wield a Hero's Relic, but there is no one here who is more powerful. Seteth and the few remaining knights can't leave the monastery unattended. We have fought under our teacher's command countless times. We are the most effective army here, and we are already prepared for battle. We have no idea what the enemy is plotting. We must act now!"
6368,Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
6369,"Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome."
6370,"Edelgard: Let's go, my teacher. Whatever happens, do not lose your conviction out there."
6371,"Dimitri: Professor, have you heard? They say we've finally located the enemy. It seems they're hiding in the sealed forest, right near the monastery. Lady Rhea has summoned all of the knights to return and take them down. And all of this is being done in secret. Why? To keep us...no, to keep you in the dark."
6372,Byleth: Why the secrecy?
6373,"Dimitri: Lady Rhea likely assumed you wouldn't be able to stop yourself from confronting the enemy if you knew their location. But that is not how this story ends, is it? Professor... We're at the ready. Order us to depart, and we'll fight at your side."
6374,Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
6375,"Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now."
6376,Byleth: You can't stop me.
6377,"Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable."
6378,"Dimitri: Lady Rhea, Seteth. Please, try to understand our reasoning before you refuse. With most of the knights still far away, we cannot afford for you two to leave the monastery undefended. The enemy's strength is yet unknown. The only warriors who likely stand a chance are those who wield Relics. With all that in mind, it's obvious who should be dispatched, is it not? If the professor leaves, we will go as well. We've already made preparations and are ready to depart at a moment's notice. Surely you must see that we cannot wait any longer for the knights to gather. Please... Do what must be done and give us the order."
6379,Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
6380,"Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome."
6381,"Dimitri: No matter what enemy we face, we will not fail. I promise you that."
6382,"Claude: Teach! Tomas… I mean…Solon and his lackeys. Their whereabouts have been discovered. Apparently they're lurking in the Sealed Forest, not too far from the monastery. Rhea has called back all of the knights who were out searching to round them up. Seems like it could take some time for them to make it back here…but she didn't ask for our help."
6383,Byleth: Why keep it a secret?
6384,Claude: Perhaps to prevent you from running headfirst toward revenge? It's only natural that you would leap at the chance for it. Anyone would.
6385,Rhea: No. I will not allow it.
6386,"Seteth: This discovery comes just when the knights are at their busiest. It is all too likely that our foes revealed themselves to lure you out there. They are the ones who took Jeralt from you… I know how you must despise them, but I must ask you to rein in your personal feelings for now."
6387,Byleth: You can't stop me.
6388,"Rhea: Please, Professor. Do not act carelessly. I ask that you leave this to us. Losing you so soon after losing Jeralt would be unbearable."
6389,"Claude: Listen, Rhea. Erm, Lady Rhea. This move is the most strategic. The military strategy I'm devising will soon echo across Fódlan's history. I'm sure of it. Just think about it. Most of the knights are still far away, and we can't afford to have Seteth and friends abandon the monastery. So the only person who can take action now also happens to be our best commander. It's Teach, and wherever Teach leads, we'll follow. And since you've taught us that this sort of thing is always a possibility, we're already prepared for battle. We can buy the knights more time. Not for revenge, but for a defensive attack on behalf of the monastery."
6390,Rhea: Professor… Do you agree with this strategy?
6391,"Rhea: Understood. I will give you the order. Destroy the enemy that is hiding in the Sealed Forest… You have the protection of the goddess on your side. Whatever happens, you shall overcome."
6392,"Claude: We have our orders, Teach. Now all that's left is to pull out a miracle."
6393,Hubert: We are now within the Sealed Forest. We must not let our guard down.
6394,"Bernadetta: Professor... We'll avenge Jeralt for you, no matter what!"
6395,Ferdinand: Remember--it is a bad idea to get distracted by revenge.
6396,Petra: I have readiness. Our enemies will be taking...we will take our enemies down!
6397,"Linhardt: Well, it's not like we have any other missions this month. I suppose this is as good a way as any to spend our energy."
6398,Caspar: Linhardt spending energy? We had better finish this fast before the pigs start flying everywhere.
6399,Dorothea: Lower your voice. The enemy could be close!
6400,Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
6401,"Edelgard: Professor, I know I'm the one who insisted we come here, but don't doubt for a moment that the enemy is waiting for you."
6402,Hubert: Lady Edelgard! What are you saying?
6403,"Edelgard: What other objective could they possibly have? We have no clue what kind of trap is waiting for us. Please be careful, my teacher. We can't afford to lose you..."
6404,"Hubert: The enemy is strong, but you will prevail. You must."
6405,Dedue: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Stay alert.
6406,Ingrid: This is for Captain Jeralt. I will not falter.
6407,Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
6408,"Ashe: Leave it to us, Professor. I'll give it my all."
6409,"Sylvain: Fighting Tomas... It will be difficult, that's for certain."
6410,Mercedes: I don't really love the idea of fighting people I know...
6411,"Annette: We don't have a choice. Even if it's difficult, an enemy is an enemy. We've just got to get it over with!"
6412,"Felix: Just kill them from behind. As long as you don't see their faces, you won't know if you know them."
6413,"Dimitri: We won't know unless we see their face... Yes, I suppose that is true. Professor... I hope you know I meant what I told you before. Your enemy is my enemy. And I will follow you until the end, whatever that end may be."
6414,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's reassuring.
Choice 2: Let's do our best."
6415,Choice 1: That's reassuring.
6416,Choice 2: Let's do our best.
6417,"Dimitri: Yes...right. We'll fulfill our duty together. We've come this far. We can't stop now. I hope you know that you can rely on us. No matter who the enemy is, we are prepared to cut them down."
6418,Dimitri: Yes... No matter who they may be...
6419,"Claude: The Sealed Forest is up ahead. Visibility is awful there, so everyone needs to be extra cautious."
6420,"Hilda: You seem to know a lot about it. It is just a forest, isn't it?"
6421,"Claude: Have you been there too? Oh… Never mind. Listen, just like I told the archbishop, this is not a war of vengeance. It's a riddle, so to speak. Those guys are undoubtedly planning something terrible. We need some kind of clue as to what. The attack on the Holy Mausoleum. That foul business in Remire. The Demonic Beasts at the chapel… It can't go on. We need to figure out their objective and stop them from achieving it. That's our mission."
6422,"Lorenz: So, we have our mission now. We had better not fail."
6423,"Lysithea: It is a difficult task, but we will succeed."
6424,Flayn: It is time to repay the kindness of the professor who saved my life!
6425,Ignatz: An enemy whose objective you don't understand is a frightening prospect.
6426,Raphael: We're gonna destroy 'em! It's our mission!
6427,"Leonie: I will have my revenge, whatever it takes. On that, I will never budge."
6428,Marianne: Leonie… You will have what you seek.
6429,"Claude: I'll admit, vengeance sounds pretty nice. But don't forget that we're here for information. Luckily, we can easily find what we're looking for while getting revenge for Jeralt. Right, Teach?"
6430,Suggested Level: 19
6431,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
6432,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude falls in battle."
6433,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
6434,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard/Dimitri/Claude falls in battle.
6435,Edelgard: Look there! Demonic Beasts! I suppose they aren't holding back.
6436,Dimitri: Demonic Beasts! The enemy was always intending to lure us here...
6437,Claude: How kind of them to welcome us with Demonic Beasts. They're not playing around.
6438,Monica: Hello! You're here! Welcome to the forest of death! My name is Kronya. This weakling girl was just a borrowed look for me.
6439,"Kronya: This is what I really look like! Now, you vermin... I'll take down every last one of you!"
6440,"Kronya: If this takes too long, I might be forced to escape. Oh, or do you simply intend to let me go? How accommodating of you! As for me, I intend to kill you all. (laughs)"
6441,Kronya: You're a fool to be so brazen. You'll never avenge your father at this rate. I'll have to kill you too! With my own hands!
6442,Kronya: Huh? What are you-- Are you here to kill me?
6443,Edelgard: I am. Prepare yourself for death while you still can.
6444,Leonie: Monica. You'll pay for what you've done.
6445,"Kronya: I told you! I am not Monica, I am Kronya! Do not call me by that fake name!"
6446,Leonie: I don't care what you're called. I don't care if it takes my last breath. I'll kill you.
6447,Kronya: Please! My powers are beyond your comprehension. You're just a filthy worm!
6448,"Kronya: How cute, you're trying so hard! But now it's time to die!"
6449,Kronya: But how? How could I really lose...to a lowly creature like you?
6450,Solon: Well.
6451,Kronya: Solon! Don't just stand there and stare! I need your help!
6452,Solon: Yes. You most certainly do.
6453,Kronya: Huh?
6454,"Solon: Have no fear, Kronya. Your sacrifice will help to rid of this world of the filthy vermin that have long infested it."
6455,Kronya: Solon... Stop this!
6456,Solon: The time has finally come...to unleash the Forbidden Spell of Zahras upon our enemies!
6457,Kronya: Please...help me...
6458,Solon: Begone with you...Fell Star.
6459,Edelgard: That could only have been magic! What happened to our professor?
6460,"Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world... To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator..."
6461,"Caspar: You're lying! Our professor is alive, I know it!"
6462,Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
6463,Hubert: It is hard to fathom that our professor would die in a place like this.
6464,Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape... Overwhelmed with hopelessness... It must be torturous.
6465,"Edelgard: You're already boasting a victory, but know this--if you did use such devious tricks to stop our professor... I swear that you will regret it."
6466,"Ferdinand: I cannot help but agree with her this once. Even if our professor is trapped in darkness, that is not the end of their story."
6467,"Solon: I will not forgive such arrogance. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!"
6468,Dimitri: What was that sorcery? What happened to our professor?!
6469,"Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…"
6470,Annette: That's a lie! There's no way the professor is really dead!
6471,Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
6472,Dedue: I do not believe our professor has fallen.
6473,Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.
6474,"Dedue: We cannot abandon hope, Your Highness. Our professor lives. I know it."
6475,"Dimitri: You're right. We will save the professor. But first, let's destroy this fiend! I'll slice you into a thousand pieces as we watch with horror... You will know true pain before I finally allow you to die!"
6476,"Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!"
6477,"Hilda: Wh-what was that? Where did you go, Professor?!"
6478,"Solon: They were swallowed by the mystical darkness of the forbidden spell. An eternity wandering in a void of darkness, never to return to this world… To think we almost had the Sword of the Creator…"
6479,Lysithea: I don't believe anything you say! Our professor is still alive!
6480,Flayn: That's right! Our professor is no ordinary human!
6481,Claude: I refuse to believe that Teach would die in a place like this!
6482,Solon: It is possible that death has yet to find your friend. But there are worse things than death. Drifting through the darkness with no chance to escape…Overwhelmed with hopelessness… It must be torturous.
6483,"Claude: Hey, all I hear is good news. Teach is still alive. And if that's true, then there's only one thing to do. Defeat you while we wait for Teach's triumphant return!"
6484,Leonie: Prepare yourself. We will avenge our leader here and now!
6485,"Solon: How trite. But if you wish for pain, I shall oblige. If you prefer it so, you shall also be added to the ranks of the dead!"
6486,Byleth: ...
6487,Sothis: You fool!
6488,"Sothis: What were you thinking, charging right into an enemy's trap? Are you just a boulder that rolls down whatever hill it's on? No, even a boulder has more sense!"
6489,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sorry.
Sothis: Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!
Choice 2: I can explain...
Sothis: Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!"
6490,"Choice 1: I'm sorry.
Sothis: Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!"
6491,Sothis: Apologizing won't make things right! This darkness is terrifying!
6492,"Choice 2: I can explain...
Sothis: Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!"
6493,Sothis: Excuses won't help us! This darkness is terrifying!
6494,"Sothis: As you and I are one... I, too, am trapped within this void. But please consider this... This realm of darkness we are in is seperate from the world from which you came. I mean that it would take a god to leave this place. In time, our hearts and minds will cease to be. Are you prepared to die?"
6495,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am.
Sothis: How very brave of you, to joke at times like these...
Choice 2: I am not.
Sothis: I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet..."
6496,"Choice 1: I am.
Sothis: How very brave of you, to joke at times like these..."
6497,"Sothis: How very brave of you, to joke at times like these..."
6498,"Choice 2: I am not.
Sothis: I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet..."
6499,Sothis: I thought as much. I also do not wish to die. And yet...
6500,Sothis: There is no other choice...
6501,Byleth: What choice?
6502,"Sothis: Do you recall your father's diary? He said you were a child who never cried nor laughed. I think I am the one to blame. I must have been asleep, but even then, I feel I was a part of you. I do not know how Rhea managed it, but she allowed me to exist inside of you. The truth is I have always been with you. It is within you that I found my power yet again. The power of a goddess. The power of the progenitor god."
6503,Byleth: ...
6504,"Sothis: My name is Sothis. By now you must be well aware of what that means. I am the one who watches over Fódlan and the creatures dwelling there. I am Sothis, she who died then returned."
6505,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can't believe it.
Choice 2: Somehow, I know it to be true."
6506,Choice 1: I can't believe it.
6507,"Choice 2: Somehow, I know it to be true."
6508,"Sothis: There is only one thing left to do to save us from this darkness of eternity. I must now use the power of a god. However, I lack a body of my own. And so, I must relinquish all the power that I have...to you. The time has come for you and I to join as one. And when that comes to pass...then I shall disappear."
6509,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Disappear?!
Choice 2: I won't allow it."
6510,Choice 1: Disappear?!
6511,Choice 2: I won't allow it.
6512,"Sothis: When I say disappear, I do not mean that all I am will be no more. My soul will join with yours, and you and I will never be apart. But...I will no longer have a chance to speak with you. I shall miss it. So long have I been on this path with you. Through you, I got to see and hear this world. I even got to chastise you from time to time. I may not have acted like a goddess, but...it was certainly fun. For all that you have done... Thank you. I'm glad that it was you to whom my fate was bound."
6513,Byleth: Thank you...for everything.
6514,"Sothis: Now... We must pray. For if we share this wish, our spirits two will join as one... Your wish...is to return to the forest, stop the enemy, and rescue the little ones. No need for words. I know your heart as though it were my own..."
6515,"Sothis: Your will and mine are now as one. Both sides of time are revealed to you, and you alone."
6516,Sothis: You know I am the beginning. What shall you do?
6517,Solon: So the Fell Star consumes even the darkness itself...
6518,"Edelgard: Professor... It is you, right? I knew that you would always come back to us. I'd like to ask about your appearance, but for now, let's dispose of our enemies."
6519,"Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!"
6520,"Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow..."
6521,"Edelgard: It's over. Now, Professor. About your appearance..."
6522,"Dimitri: Professor... That is you, isn't it? I am glad you are safe. I was sure that you would return. Please tell me all that happened to you later. For now, it's imperative that we kill the demon!"
6523,"Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!"
6524,"Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow..."
6525,Dimitri: Thales... Does he also serve the Flame Emperor? It can't be...
6526,"Claude: Teach... You are Teach, right? I always believed in you... I knew you could cut your way out of anything."
6527,"Solon: What did you see in the darkness of Zahras? This should be impossible. The only being that can withstand that darkness is... Unless I dispose of you myself, I may never have the chance to send you back there!"
6528,"Solon: But this is not the end... Thales will carry out our mission, somehow..."
6529,Claude: I guess this is still far from over...
6530,Solon: I am terrified by you... Even though an emotion like fear has no place inside me. That means you must be eliminated.
6531,Solon: So this is how it is... I cannot let you live!
6532,Edelgard: You stole the words from my mouth. You lost the moment you failed to kill the professor.
6533,Solon: I have no time to waste on the likes of you...
6534,Solon: To think...that I would lose to mere beasts.
6535,Edelgard: That hair...and those eyes... You remind me of someone. What happened to you?
6536,Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
6537,"Edelgard: The goddess? I see... Well, I'm happy for you. Your weapon is called the Sword of the Creator, after all. It's no wonder she looks favorably upon you. Just as it was with saint Seiros, no doubt... And just how will you use this new power, Professor?"
6538,"Byleth:
Choice 1: For the people of the world.
Edelgard: Heh, that is so like you to say that.
Choice 2: For my students.
Edelgard: For us? I see...
Choice 3: For myself.
Edelgard: That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself."
6539,"Choice 1: For the people of the world.
Edelgard: Heh, that is so like you to say that."
6540,"Edelgard: Heh, that is so like you to say that."
6541,"Choice 2: For my students.
Edelgard: For us? I see..."
6542,Edelgard: For us? I see...
6543,"Choice 3: For myself.
Edelgard: That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself."
6544,Edelgard: That is no answer. You must use your power for something greater than yourself.
6545,"Edelgard: Tell me... If the world, and your students included, were to divide and go to war with each other, what would you do? In that scenario, each side would represent both the world and your students. Who would you--"
6546,Edelgard: Professor? Have you...fallen asleep?! This must be a side effect of your recent...changes. I can't just leave you here...
6547,"Edelgard: I could try carrying you, but... No, I had better call for Hubert."
6548,"Edelgard: I shouldn't ask Hubert to carry you, so I suppose it falls to me..."
6549,"Dimitri: Professor... I'm glad you're OK. And you seem relatively unscathed. I'm...I'm so relieved. What's more, Jeralt's foe is dead. Though we took little satisfaction from it. Professor... I must ask. What happened after we were separated? You look...different."
6550,Byleth: The goddess gifted me her power.
6551,"Dimitri: The goddess appeared...and gave you her power? It's as though...the legend of old has been made flesh. It's hard to grasp, in all honestly. But having seen you pierce the sky with my own eyes, I find myself unable to doubt it."
6552,Byleth: A legend of old?
6553,"Dimitri: Yes. The legend of Saint Seiros. It is said that she received a divine revelation from the goddess and was gifted with her power. Long ago, the goddess dispatched Seiros to defeat an evil king who went mad with power. Perhaps the goddess saw the goodness of Seiros within you too, and wished to help you in your quest to defeat evil. Hm. If you're Seiros, granted power by the goddess, then I suppose that makes me... Ah, never mind. I'm getting carried away."
6554,"Dimitri: Professor! What's wrong?! Are you...uh... Are you asleep? What is happening these days? Well, it matters not. We must get you help, and fast."
6555,Dimitri: It'll be faster if I carry you and run.
6556,"Dimitri: Sorry, Professor, but I have no choice but to carry you back."
6557,"Claude: Teach! We won! I'll be honest—when I lost sight of you, I broke into a cold sweat. But Jeralt's killer is dead. All's well that ends well."
6558,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's true.
Choice 2: True…"
6559,Choice 1: That's true.
6560,Choice 2: True…
6561,"Claude: You're kidding, right? I understood putting it off while we were in battle, but now that it's over, just go ahead and spit it out. That hair. Those eyes. That unfathomable power. What happened out there?"
6562,Byleth: I will tell you…
6563,Claude: You mean to tell me…that an entity who claims to be the goddess was living inside your mind? And it's been that way since you were a baby? And this goddess entrusted all of her goddess-like power to you and then vanished…
6564,"Claude: It's a difficult story to swallow, Teach. But the way you look now… I guess I've got no choice but to believe it. How could something like that happen? There must be a clue in Jeralt's diary. If you believe the diary, there's a high possibility that Rhea did something to you when you were born. That's likely when all this began. What in the world happened to you as a baby? And what was Rhea after?"
6565,Claude: Teach! What's the matter?! Did you trip or… Wait. Are you sleeping? This must be an effect of the goddess's power. I wonder if Teach's body can handle the strain…
6566,"Claude: Think, Claude. What now? Should I carry him on my back? Easier said than done…"
6567,"Claude: Think, Claude. What now? Maybe Hilda can help carry her back? She'll complain, but she won't refuse…"
6568,"Rhea: (singing) In time's flow...see the glow of flames ever burning bright... On the swift river's drift, broken memories alight..."
6569,Rhea: Professor. You must remain still.
6570,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Where am I?
Choice 2: What happened?"
6571,Choice 1: Where am I?
6572,Choice 2: What happened?
6573,Rhea: Everything is all right. There is no need to worry. Those who are trying to harm you are far away.
6574,"Rhea: ... How lovely...it would be for this moment to last forever... I wish I could hold on to this time we have stolen... that you and I could create a world without end... I have heard whispers of what happened to you. Your appearance... You have received power from the goddess. From the moment you took hold of the Sword of the Creator... I prayed that one day the radiant power of Sothis, which bathes Fódlan in its celestial light, might reside within you. But you are so much more than the light. You are my... Close your eyes, dear one. Sleep, just a while longer."
6575,"Rhea: I will be watching over you, always. Always and forever..."
6576,"The northern lands are enveloped in a bitter cold, and frigid winds are carried across the sea to the south of Adrestia. When feather-white snow falls on Fódlan's Locket, the fort looks as delicate as a pearl. However....beneath that snowy blanket, her Throat is more treacherous than ever.

6642,"Seteth: Rhea, please talk to me. What are you hiding? What is the meaning of how that one looks? It is almost as though..."
6643,"Rhea: As I said, there is nothing of which to speak. For now. At the end of this month..."
6644,Seteth: I read Jeralt's diary. I happened upon it in his room.
6645,Rhea: What?
6646,"Seteth: In it, he stated the reason for his departure. The baby thought to have died in the fire...has returned to us. Jeralt realized that you had done something to the child and decided to flee. What did you do to that baby, Rhea? Nothing...questionable, I should hope?"
6647,"Rhea: Seteth, enough. They will be here shortly. No more, I beg of you. I will take our dear professor to the Holy Tomb. There...I should be able to see our dearest wishes to fruition. When I was young, I heard her voice there... I'm sure of it."
6648,Rhea: You may enter.
6649,"Rhea: I have been awaiting your arrival, Professor. Now that you have received sacred power from the goddess, there is somewhere you must pay a visit to at once. You must go to the Holy Tomb so that you may receive a divine revelation from the goddess."
6650,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Holy Tomb?
Choice 2: A revelation?"
6651,Choice 1: The Holy Tomb?
6652,Choice 2: A revelation?
6653,Seteth: The Holy Tomb is where the goddess sleeps. This monastery was originally built for the purpose of protecting that hallowed temple.
6654,"Rhea: Only a select few know of it, but there is a legend about Seiros and the Holy Tomb. Saint Seiros, the first soul to be gifted power from the goddess, received her revelation there. She was told it was her sacred duty to save the people of Fódlan, and that she must use her power wisely in order to lead them. The words that were handed down to Seiros from the goddess will likely fall upon your ears as well."
6655,"Seteth: Prepare yourself to go at once. There, may you find out why you were blessed with such power."
6656,Rhea: There will be a ceremony at the Holy Tomb. It is then that you will receive the goddess's revelation. You may share this mission with your students.
6657,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you think it wise to bring them into this?
Choice 2: A mission? Now?"
6658,Choice 1: Do you think it wise to bring them into this?
6659,Choice 2: A mission? Now?
6660,"Rhea: It is said that when Seiros received the revelation, she had holy warriors by her side, protecting her. Your students, who have followed you and fought alongside you through the darkest of times, are well suited to stand by you for the ceremony. Of course, as the leader of the Church of Seiros, I will be by your side as well."
6661,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Strange...
Rhea: The occasion is too significant to be missed.
Choice 2: Isn't that too dangerous? (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: The Holy Tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world. There is nothing to fear."
6662,"Choice 1: Strange...
Rhea: The occasion is too significant to be missed."
6663,Rhea: The occasion is too significant to be missed.
6664,"Choice 2: Isn't that too dangerous? (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: The Holy Tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world. There is nothing to fear."
6665,Rhea: The Holy Tomb is a sacred temple that is sealed off from the rest of the world. There is nothing to fear.
6666,"Rhea: Even if something were to happen, I am more than capable of protecting myself."
6667,"Seteth: Much has changed, but your duty has not wavered. Steel your mind for the ceremony, and prepare your students well."
6668,"Claude: Rhea and Seteth were not their usual selves. What happened to Teach that's ""questionable"", and what really awaits at the Holy Tomb? The way they were acting, I don't think they have any plans of sharing that information."
6669,Byleth: (I can't hear Sothis's voice anymore...)
6670,"Edelgard: Professor, you should know that I'll be away from the monastery for a few days."
6671,Byleth: Where are you going?
6672,"Edelgard: It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Don't worry, I'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb."
6673,"Dedue: Professor. Please. If he hears it from you that he needs to rest, perhaps His Highness will listen."
6674,"Dimitri: He's exaggerating. He thinks my color is off and that rest will cure all. I have a headache, but that's just from lack of sleep. It's not going to stop me from completing this month's mission."
6675,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should rest. (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The professor agrees. Please rest. At least until the task is at hand.
Dimitri: I won't. Even if I tried, it's not like I would get any decent sleep. It would only be a waste of time.
Choice 2: Don't overexert yourself.
Dedue: I must insist—
Dimitri: Who do you think you are? I can take care of myself, Dedue."
6676,"Choice 1: You should rest. (Relationship with Dedue up)

6682,"Dimitri: In any case, we won't let you down this month, Professor. You can rely on us."
6683,"Claude: Hey, Teach. Is it OK for you to be out on your own right now? Just…please be careful not to topple over again. You scared us nearly to death. Anyway… Doesn't Rhea want something from you? Sounds important. I'm glad I'll be there to witness the ritual at the Holy Tomb. I want to see whether or not something happens with my own eyes."
6684,"Claude: I always knew there was something special about you, but you've only gotten more and more extraordinary the longer I've know you. That transformation was just the beginning, wasn't it? I have a feeling that things will only grow more dire from here on out."
6685,"Ferdinand: Edelgard and Hubert have been busier than usual. Constantly coming and going, in and out of Garreg Mach. Perhaps they are doing something in the Empire? As the legitimate heir of the Aegir family, I have not heard anything about it. But if it were significant, I am sure my father would have told me."
6686,"Linhardt: How are you, Professor? Did Hanneman make his, ""I will do no harm"" speech or promise ""this won't hurt a bit"" when he asked to study you? Both? I've a bit of research I'd like to perform. Nothing so crass as Hanneman's poking, prodding, and drawing of blood. No, I wish to investigate Crest power itself. Crest power must have some kind of limit, right? Lady Rhea says any limits must be the protection of the goddess, but that doesn't quite answer it for me. Hmm..."
6687,Caspar: You're so strong now! I'm starting to understand why you were appointed professor.
6688,"Caspar: I thought I was stronger, but I still have such a long way to go."
6689,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Try to catch up to me. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: Oh, I will. I still plan on beating you some day!
Choice 2: I'll help you get there.
Caspar: You'd better not go easy on me. I need your training to be strict if I'm gonna get any better!"
6690,"Choice 1: Try to catch up to me. (Relationship with Caspar up)

6693,Caspar: You'd better not go easy on me. I need your training to be strict if I'm gonna get any better!
6694,"Bernadetta: So hungry... Oh, is that you, Professor? Sorry. I'm really not feeling well this month. Even leaving my room for dinner is just too much. It's got nothing to do with your, um...changes. So, um, don't open the door, please!"
6695,"Dorothea: Recently, Professor, I feel as though you've been a bit distant. It's like you're sort of floating above the clouds, separate from other people... And like you've got no interest at all in ever coming back down. How can I help?"
6696,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm not being distant, so don't worry.
Choice 2: I don't know what to say to that. (Relationship with Dorothea up)"
6697,"Choice 1: I'm not being distant, so don't worry."
6698,Choice 2: I don't know what to say to that. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
6699,"Dorothea: Hey, don't worry. I thought maybe I'd ask and see what you'd say."
6700,"Petra: In Brigid, we have legends. Stories containing people who have a spirit living inside of them. Those spirit people have much strength. They are maybe able to fly in the air or race across the ocean. Hair that shines and eyes that glow... They have qualities that are not unlike what you are looking like, Professor."
6701,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can't fly.
Petra: Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky...
Choice 2: Perhaps. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Do not have doubt, Professor. The powers you have are like the powers of the legends."
6702,"Choice 1: I can't fly.
Petra: Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky..."
6703,Petra: Are you knowing that for certain? Maybe you will have wings that grow and soar through the sky...

6705,"Petra: Do not have doubt, Professor. The powers you have are like the powers of the legends."
6706,"Felix: Hurry up and cage the wild boar. Look, he's losing his grip. Even in his swordplay, he's getting sloppy. If he keeps progressing like this, he's going to get himself killed. Kronya, Solon... They're dead, but we still have a glut of enemies. We still have to take down the Death Knight and the Flame Emperor. Our next battle is fast approaching. I'm ready for it."
6707,Ashe: I can't even imagine what it must be like inside the Holy Tomb.
6708,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know either. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: Well, it's probably a grave, that much is for sure. And it's likely underground. Beyond that, who knows?
Choice 2: It's just a place to bury people.
Ashe: I guess you're right. Holy or not, all graves are kind of the same, aren't they?"
6709,"Choice 1: I don't know either. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: Well, it's probably a grave, that much is for sure. And it's likely underground. Beyond that, who knows?"

6712,"Ashe: I guess you're right. Holy or not, all graves are kind of the same, aren't they?"
6713,Ashe: I can't help but wonder though... Just what kind of ritual is this?
6714,"Sylvain: I swear, it's like you're an entirely different person."
6715,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I haven't changed on the inside.
Sylvain: Heh, I guess you're right. If I look hard, I can still tell it's you.
Choice 2: Isn't it weird? (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: (If Byleth is male) No, not at all! I'm just not used to it. It really suits you though.
Sylvain: (If Byleth is female) It's not weird at all. It's... You're somehow even more beautiful than before. I'm joking! I'm joking! Don't get mad."
6716,"Choice 1: I haven't changed on the inside.

6721,"Ingrid: You've been granted this power by the goddess herself. Truly, you must be a very special individual. Maybe Seiros transformed before receiving her revelation too!"
6722,Mercedes: Hmm. I haven't heard anything about that before... Maybe that part never found its way into the legend?
6723,"Ingrid: It is told that Seiros had a revelation instructing her to use her power for good, and to lead the people of Fódlan to salvation... I wonder what sort of revelation you might have, Professor."
6724,"Annette: Bah! Professor! Sorry, this will take some getting used to... Your hair and eye color are completely different! You just don't look like yourself anymore."
6725,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's only my appearance that has changed. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: Of course. You're right. I'm just being silly, as usual.
Choice 2: Maybe I am a different person...
Annette: Don't scare me like that! You are still you...right? You are, right?"
6726,"Choice 1: It's only my appearance that has changed. (Relationship with Annette up)

6730,"Lorenz: To be honest, I cannot keep up with all that's been happening recently. Monica was actually Kronya. Tomas was actually Solon. Who were these people? What about you, Professor? You are a true ally, yes?"
6731,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's my intention. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: Not the most convincing answer you could have given. Still, I simply must take you at your word.
Choice 2: I don't know.
Lorenz: Pull yourself together! It is still your duty to lead us, is it not?"
6732,"Choice 1: That's my intention. (Relationship with Lorenz up)

6736,"Raphael: You look so...different. You're still our professor in there, right? Did anything else change besides your hair and eyes? Are your arms bigger? How do your abs look?"
6737,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've changed quite a bit. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Really?! You gotta teach me how to do that!
Choice 2: I haven't changed that much.
Raphael: That's disappointing. What's even the point?"
6738,"Choice 1: I've changed quite a bit. (Relationship with Raphael up)

Raphael: That's disappointing. What's even the point?"
6741,Raphael: That's disappointing. What's even the point?
6742,"Ignatz: So, this month's mission is to take part in a ritual at the Holy Tomb, where you will receive a revelation from the goddess herself. What if she really appears? What if I finally get to gaze upon her radiance? I've always imagined the goddess--how beautiful she must be!"
6743,"Ignatz: You're going to the ritual at the Holy Tomb, right? I hear that a revelation from the goddess is expected. What if she shows herself? I'll be so jealous!"
6744,"Lysithea: Your hair! And your eyes! What happened to you?! You didn't lose something as a result of gaining those powers, did you?"
6745,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't worry—I'm fine. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I see. Well, that makes me feel better. But still, be careful.
Choice 2: I don't know yet.
Lysithea: Sometimes our frail bodies don’t do well with excess power… So don’t push yourself too hard."

6750,"Marianne: Long ago, Saint Seiros was gifted with a divine revelation from the goddess, as well as incredible power. Is that what happened to you too, Professor?"
6751,"Hilda: No way! The professor transformed before receiving any kind of divine revelation, right? Still, I wonder. Does the fact that you've changed really mean you've been granted some kind of power?"
6752,"Marianne: If that's the case, then what sort of revelation can be gained from the ritual?"
6753,"Hilda: I'm guessing the revelation will just be a gentle reminder to use this new power to save the people of Fódlan. What else is there to say? You don't actually believe we're going to hear the voice of the goddess, do you?"
6754,"Leonie: When you changed, even the other professors were taken completely by surprise. There's a ritual at the Holy Tomb this month, isn't there? I wonder what will happen with that. I'm sure you'll be all right. But don't lose sight of who you really are, OK? However you may change, and whatever new power goes along with those changes--you'll still be the same person, deep down. Remember that."
6755,"Rhea: You haven't a thing to worry about. You have been gifted the power of the goddess. Furthermore, you have overcome the death of your father, Jeralt...and you have destroyed countless of our wicked foes. I am proud...so very proud of who you have become."
6756,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thank you. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: Once we finish the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum, all will be well.
Choice 2: I'm uneasy.
Rhea: That is understandable. Just know that your unease should disappear the moment we conclude the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum."
6757,"Choice 1: Thank you. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: Once we finish the ritual at the Holy Mausoleum, all will be well."

6761,"Seteth: Hmm... Ah. It is you. I am sorry, but I have a lot on my mind. I would prefer to be alone right now."
6762,"Flayn: Professor, I am so happy. Your new hair and eye color suit you well. We make quite the pair! But...recently I sense that things are a bit strained between Lady Rhea and my brother. She wants to do something at the Holy Tomb. I do not know what, but... Hm. Whenever it has concluded, I hope they will return to their friendship, as it has always been..."
6763,"Alois: Captain... Oh, Professor! How long have you been standing there? I didn't see you. I was just sorting through Captain Jeralt's belongings. I... Haven't made much progress. I keep finding things that bring back memories. Clearing out this room of his belongings again, it's... It's not easy."
6764,"Catherine: In our battle last month, we really cut the enemy down to size. But there are other enemies we have yet to hunt down, not the least the Flame Emperor. Once we've crushed them all, we can return to our peaceful lives at the monastery. It will happen soon. I have a feeling something big is coming."
6765,"Shamir: People who live an inordinately long time, people whose hair changes color, and those odd Heroes' Relics... Is Fódlan some mystical land full of inhuman creatures?"
6766,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's not like that.
Shamir: You still look human. For now, at least.
Choice 2: Is the world different outside Fódlan? (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: You should see for yourself. I'd recommend exploring west of the Empire."
6767,"Choice 1: It's not like that.
Shamir: You still look human. For now, at least."

6770,Shamir: You should see for yourself. I'd recommend exploring west of the Empire.
6771,"Gilbert: Sometimes, I find myself thinking I should leave Garreg Mach and return to my home... Where I should have been all along."
6772,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Where you should have been? (Relationship with Gilbert up)
Gilbert: Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more.
Choice 2: I won't stop you..."
6773,"Choice 1: Where you should have been? (Relationship with Gilbert up)
Gilbert: Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more."
6774,"Gilbert: Ignore me. I'm sorry...it's a silly thing. An old man's ramblings, and nothing more."
6775,Choice 2: I won't stop you...
6776,Gilbert: I hear that Lady Rhea will accompany you for this month's task. She's the pillar that supports the hearts of Fódlan's people. Her safety is paramount. I hope there are no complications...
6777,"Hanneman: Are you positive? Really? Your appearance is due to the influence of the [[Crest of Flames? Intriguing. Unfortunately, I have found no record of Nemesis's hair and eye color ever changing. However... If that transformation was brought on, in part, by the power of the Crest, that would be most... Well, I suppose interesting is too small a word. Still, it would be an absolutely exceptional discovery. To know for certain, we must investigate further. So, clothes off!"
6778,Byleth: ...
6779,"Hanneman: What? A full physical is in order, yes? We need to know if this transformation affected you adversely. Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit."
6780,"Manuela: The Holy Tomb, huh? I've worked here for years, and this is the first I've heard of it. I mean, it does make some sense. Sort of. Something about it is still weird. I understand now why they'd build the monastery in the mountainous center of Fódlan. Although... When the monastery was built, the Kingdom and the Alliance weren't even around yet. But look how cleverly it was placed right in the middle of the Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance. That's weird, right?"
6781,"Cyril: When I first saw you, Professor, with that hair color and that eye color? I thought you looked kind of like Lady Rhea. Like maybe you could be related. I like the way it looks! I wonder if I could change my hair color too... Maybe if I tried hard enough. If I thought real hard about it, I mean."
6782,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That would be exciting, wouldn't it? (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did.
Choice 2: You don't need to do that, Cyril.
Cyril: I might not need to, but I still wanna."
6783,"Choice 1: That would be exciting, wouldn't it? (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did."
6784,"Cyril: All I need to do is get trapped up in a strange place and then escape, right? Just like you did."
6785,"Choice 2: You don't need to do that, Cyril.
Cyril: I might not need to, but I still wanna."
6786,"Cyril: I might not need to, but I still wanna."
6787,"Anna: Hey, Professor. You seem...different. Lots of things seem...different around here lately. I've noticed it. Have you?"
6788,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Although I suppose...you are something to report! For a moment, I thought you were someone suspicious! Lucky for you, I am quite perceptive. It took only that single moment for me to recognize you. (laughs) The professor went out and got some new power!"
6789,"Knight of Seiros: In town earlier, there seemed to be more people around than usual. Is there some festival this month that I'm forgetting about?"
6790,"Soldier: Those students of yours will soon graduate and become unreachable royalty and nobility. You should show them respect now, or you might find yourself out of a job someday. Heh...no. One look at your students' faces, and it's apparent that would never happen. Even when your kids graduate, I bet they'll still think fondly of you. You'll always be ""Professor"" to them."
6791,"Student: I recently had an errand to run, and so I had to pass by the office... I didn't mean to, but I overheard Lady Rhea and Seteth arguing. Actually, it was more like Seteth was interrogating Lady Rhea."
6792,"Knight of Seiros: Monica... No, Kronya. Kronya is dead. And so is Solon, by your hand... Taking vengeance with your own hand. I'm sure Jeralt would be proud."
6793,"Monk: All things considered, this year has been rather terrible... As far as the students are concerned, next month is the last one of the school year. Next month we will hold the graduation ceremony, though it'll be an understandably subdued affair. This month we ask that you carry out your duties as best you can to ensure that our students remain calm."
6794,Yuri: Things certainly have changed lately. Not that I mind. Or perhaps the only thing that's different is how you look. Or has your personality changed too?
6795,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm more talkative now. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Heh heh... Well, that's cute. Glad you're able to joke around, at least. Makes me less concerned about you.
Choice 2: I haven't changed.
Yuri: Is that so... You're not a great liar, you know."
6796,"Choice 1: I'm more talkative now. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Heh heh... Well, that's cute. Glad you're able to joke around, at least. Makes me less concerned about you."
6797,"Yuri: Heh heh... Well, that's cute. Glad you're able to joke around, at least. Makes me less concerned about you."
6798,"Choice 2: I haven't changed.
Yuri: Is that so... You're not a great liar, you know."
6799,"Yuri: Is that so... You're not a great liar, you know."
6800,"Yuri: Well, whatever the case, I still like you just the same as I always have."
6801,"Balthus: Hey, pal, how you holding up? The human body is strong, but we all have our limits. Even folks who fraternize with the goddess. How was she, by the way? A real knockout, yeah?"
6802,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She was unfathomably beautiful. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: I knew it! Good thing I never officially turned my back on that beaut, huh? Next punch I throw is for her!
Choice 2: She was a child.
Balthus: Really?! Huh. That's...a letdown."
6803,"Choice 1: She was unfathomably beautiful. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: I knew it! Good thing I never officially turned my back on that beaut, huh? Next punch I throw is for her!"
6804,"Balthus: I knew it! Good thing I never officially turned my back on that beaut, huh? Next punch I throw is for her!"
6805,"Choice 2: She was a child.
Balthus: Really?! Huh. That's...a letdown."
6806,Balthus: Really?! Huh. That's...a letdown.
6807,"Balthus: Well, in any case, we have our work cut out for us. No telling what they're planning next..."
6808,Constance: My word. It seems that the rumors of you receiving the goddess's power were true.
6809,"Hapi: But you're still you, obviously."
6810,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes. I'm still me. (Relationship with Constance and Hapi up)
Hapi: Good. It would be a shame if you changed into something I didn't like.
Choice 2: No. I'm a new person.
Hapi: Whatever. You don't seem all that different to me."
6811,"Choice 1: Yes. I'm still me. (Relationship with Constance and Hapi up)
Hapi: Good. It would be a shame if you changed into something I didn't like."
6812,Hapi: Good. It would be a shame if you changed into something I didn't like.
6813,"Choice 2: No. I'm a new person.
Hapi: Whatever. You don't seem all that different to me."
6814,Hapi: Whatever. You don't seem all that different to me.
6815,"Constance: It's clear to me, at least, that you are something more than you were. Something special."
6816,"Hapi: Yeah, yeah. I just hope this newfound specialness doesn't spell trouble for the rest of us."
6817,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. You look different. And you're acting different. You're just all around...different! Shaking things up, are we? I think that's great. Gotta keep things interesting, right? For what it's worth...it's a good look, and you wear it well!"
6818,"Rogue: Got a shady offer from somebody well-dressed. Noble's lapdog, probably. There was a big sack of coin on offer, but not a lot of real info about the job. It seemed suspicious, so I turned it down. Now I wonder if that was a mistake..."
6819,"Resident: Look at you! Listen, all sorts of folks wind up in this place for all sorts of reasons. Nobody's judging. Whatever happened to you doesn't make one bit of difference to any of these people."
6820,"Edelgard: Professor, will you join me? There's something I must do. It will take a few days, but I promise we'll be back in time for the ceremony at the Holy Tomb."
6821,Byleth: Where are we going?
6822,"Edelgard: It's meant to be a secret, but...I'm going to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. There is something I must do there."
6823,"(The player has two choices)
Choice 1: I'll go with you.
Choice 2: I must stay. (Returns to Explore mode with Edelgard gone)"
6824,Choice 1: I'll go with you.
6825,Choice 2: I must stay. (Returns to Explore mode with Edelgard gone)
6826,"Edelgard: Thank you, my teacher."
6827,"Edelgard: Father, forgive me for asking this of you. I know how much pain you're in--how the burden of the throne weighs heavily on you--and so--"
6828,"Emperor Ionius IX: There is no need to apologize, Edelgard. You must know... (coughs) that I do not have much time left in this world. The time has come. (coughs)"
6829,"Edelgard: Thank you, Father. Now, to complete the Imperial succession, you must relinquish your crown here in the throne room. The archbishop of the Church of Seiros would normally act as witness, but my professor will fill that role instead."
6830,Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard...
6831,"Edelgard: From this day forward, the weight of the Empire's future shall rest upon my shoulders. All that I do will be for the benefit of the people of Fódlan."
6832,"Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard von Hresvelg, the crown is yours. By the covenant between the red blood and the white sword, and by the double-headed eagle upon your head, I hereby pronounce you the new emperor. Are you prepared to take those responsibilities as your own?"
6833,"Edelgard: In accordance with the ancient covenant, and in keeping with the Hresvelg legacy... I swear that upon this throne, I shall use my reign to lead Fódlan to a new dawn and achieve peace for all."
6834,"Emperor Ionius IX: The Imperial succession is complete. (coughs) My daughter, I regret that I could not do more for you. When you were stolen away to the Kingdom, when the prime minister did those horrible things, I could only watch in horror."
6835,"Edelgard: I-- I understand, Father. In those dark times, your eyes and your fists were my salvation. Within your eyes, I saw true care. And upon your fists clenched tight with indignity, I saw the blood that dripped and fell. Even as I bled, I felt that you, too, must also be bleeding."
6836,"Duke Aegir: Your Majesty! You must not leave your sleeping chambers in your condition. (noticing Edelgard) Ah, Edelgard. I did not expect to find Your Highness here."
6837,"Edelgard: Prime Minister, you have misspoken. I am no longer ""Your Highness"" but rather...""Your Majesty""."
6838,Duke Aegir: I-Impossible!
6839,"Emperor Ionius IX: It is true. Edelgard is the new emperor of the Adrestian Empire. We will summon the officials, (coughs) and prepare an ordinance at once. And you, Prime Minister--"
6840,Edelgard: --are dismissed. It will be some time before you are allowed to make contact with the outside world again.
6841,"Duke Aegir: No! How can this be?! I- Understood, Your Majesty."
6842,"Emperor Ionius IX: Edelgard... My dear El, I leave the fate of Fódlan... (coughs) in your capable hands."
6843,Edelgard: Father...
6844,"Edelgard: Thank you for staying by my side, Professor. Now that I'm the emperor, it's time to grasp my destiny. After the ceremony at the Holy Tomb, I must return to Enbarr. This may be the last we see of each other. We are out of time, my teacher. Everyone is waiting for us. We must go."
6845,Dimitri: A revelation from the goddess... To think we'll have the honor of attending such a historical event.
6846,Dedue: I hear the archbishop will accompany us to the Holy Tomb.
6847,"Ingrid: If something happens to her, all of Fódlan will suffer. We must protect her at all costs."
6848,"Dimitri: This may sound mad, but perhaps we don't have to worry so much about that. Lady Rhea has said before that she is capable of protecting herself. I have a felling that is true. I thought it was a strange thing for her to say. and beyond that, her movements bring to mind a great warrior with an extensive military background."
6849,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who is Rhea, really?
Choice 2: If so, we have nothing to fear."
6850,"Choice 1: Who is Rhea, really?"
6851,"Choice 2: If so, we have nothing to fear."
6852,"Dimitri: I wonder. Mind it's also possible that I'm way off track. Regardless, perhaps we should brace ourselves for anything."
6853,Ashe: I never imagined attending a ceremony for real revelation.
6854,Mercedes: I wonder what the ceremony will be like. I'm so nervous. I'm not ready for this.
6855,"Felix: There's no chance for battle unless something goes terribly wrong, right? How boring."
6856,"Sylvain: If you keep saying things like that, something bad is bound to happen."
6857,"Annette: (to Flayn) What's wrong, Flayn? You look like you have something on your mind."
6858,"Flayn: Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end."
6859,"Dedue: (to Dimitri) Your Highness, I will protect you no matter what. (noticing something is wrong) Your Highness?"
6860,Dimitri: (sighs)
6861,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Lost in thought?
Choice 2: You haven't seemed like yourself lately..."
6862,Choice 1: Lost in thought?
6863,Choice 2: You haven't seemed like yourself lately...
6864,"Dimitri: Hm? Ah, I suppose you could say that. Nothing to worry about. It's about time for Lady Rhea to arrive. Let's all steel ourselves for whatever may occur at this ceremony."
6865,Claude: You're going to receive the goddess's revelation at the Holy Tomb? That's news to me. I did not see that coming.
6866,"Hilda: Lady Rhea's going too, right? I hear it will be well-guarded, but it is that really okay?"
6867,"Ignatz: If Solon's allies are still around, it's certainly true that we don't know when or where they may appear."
6868,"Leonie: I don't know what type of place this Holy Tomb is, but we should be cautious."
6869,"Raphael: If something happens, we'll have to take matters into our own hands."
6870,"Hilda: What do you think, Professor? Is it really okay for Lady Rhea to attend?"
6871,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm worried.
Claude: It seems to be tightly sealed, I'll give you that. We should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong. Yep… Just as long as nothing goes wrong.
Choice 2: It's encouraging.
Claude: Leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in Rhea's fighting ability. You're bold, Teach. I love it."
6872,"Choice 1: I'm worried.
Claude: It seems to be tightly sealed, I'll give you that. We should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong. Yep… Just as long as nothing goes wrong."
6873,"Claude: It seems to be tightly sealed, I'll give you that. We should be fine as long as nothing goes terribly wrong. Yep… Just as long as nothing goes wrong."

6875,"Claude: Leave it to our fearless leader to shrewdly factor in Rhea's fighting ability. You're bold, Teach. I love it."
6876,"Claude: Well, the truth is, we won't know what's going on until it happens. All we can do is stay on our guard and play it by ear."
6877,"Lorenz: That's quite enough babbling, Claude. There is nobody more unfit for a holy ceremony than you."
6878,"Marianne: Um, divine punishment won't strike us for setting foot in the Holy Tomb, right?"
6879,Lysithea: Good grief. Why are you always so negative?
6880,"Lysithea: Hm? Flayn, is something on your mind?"
6881,"Flayn: Who, me? No, it is nothing. May we all see this through to the end."
6882,"Claude: It still doesn't make sense to me. A goddess was living inside Teach, right? But now there's a ceremony to receive a revelation or whatever. How could that be necessary anymore? There must be another objective. (sighs) It's pointless to speculate about it now. We'll know the answer soon enough. There isn't any danger for us students, but… be careful, Teach."
6883,"Rhea: Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb."
6884,"Edelgard: To think there was such a vast space beneath the monastery all this time. It's hard imagine that any of these enormous contraptions are of this world. (pauses and says nothing, which is displayed as ""..."")"
6885,"Rhea: This is where the goddess who created this world was laid to rest, along with her children."
6886,"Rhea: It is said that our creator, the goddess Sothis, sat upon this very throne. Professor, do you recognize this throne?"
6887,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I do. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Rhea: So long... I have waited so very long for this day. Sit upon the throne. I have no doubt you will be gifted a revelation from the goddess.

6891,"Rhea: There is no need to hide anything from me. You have seen it, haven’t you? In a dream..."
6892,Rhea: Well? (pauses as nothing happens) It was supposed to be but a step away. What could possibly be missing?
6893,Edelgard: (offscreen) Stop right there.
6894,"Metodey: (laughs) Don't move, any of you. If you move, your lives will be forfeit. Thank you ever so much for guiding us this far. The Imperial army will now take possession of everything in the Holy Tomb. (snickers)"
6895,Dorothea: What's the Imperial army doing here?
6896,Ferdinand: Wait! Does he work for the Flame Emperor?
6897,Linhardt: So the Flame Emperor's connected to the Empire. I never thought that possible.
6898,"Bernadetta: Edelgard, did you know about this?"
6899,"Edelgard: Yes. In fact, I gave the order. I am the Flame Emperor."
6900,"Hubert: I guess that's the end of play-at-school, Lady Edelgard. I mean, ""Your Majesty""."
6901,"Metody: Get to work, everyone! The Crest Stones belong to us now! And take those filthy bones, too."
6902,"Rhea: Insolence! You will atone for the sin of tramping on this holy resting place. (to Byleth) Professor, destroy these villainous traitors who dare dishonor our creator!"
6903,"Caspar: Wait! What's the meaning of this, Edelgard?"
6904,Petra: (in disbelief) You... made use of us? Why?
6905,"Edelgard: I'm sorry, my teacher. I cut this path, and now I must follow it. My friends, I ask that all of you stay back. It is not my intention to fight you. (to her troops) By order of the Adrestian emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, I command you to collect the Crest Stones! If anyone attempts to stop us, kill them!"
6906,"Rhea: Are you surprised, Professor? This is the Holy Tomb."
6907,Dimitri: Incredible. To think such a vast space has been hiding beneath the monastery all this time. I wonder what powers that giant mechanism that descends beneath the ground.

6918,Dedue: Why is the Imperial Army here?
6919,Ingrid: This can't be. How did they get into Garreg Mach?
6920,Sylvain: Even the Flame Emperor is here. That can only mean--
6921,Felix: The Flame Emperor is connected to the Empire. What do you know.
6922,"Dimitri: I never imagined you'd have the nerve to return here. What are you after, Flame Emperor?"
6923,Flame Emperor: Is it not obvious? The Holy Tomb contains great power; the power to rule all of Fódlan.
6924,"Dimitri: And to attain that power, you'll trample anything that stands in your way, just like you did in Duscur!"
6925,"Flame Emperor: I had nothing to do with that. (to their troops) Quickly, retrieve the Crest Stones! Kill for them if you must."

6941,"Hilda: Hey, who is that standing next to the angry guy? Could that be--"
6942,Claude: The Flame Emperor. I see. So you've been allied with the Empire from the beginning.
6943,Leonie: What are they doing here? What do they hope to gain?
6944,"Claude: There's only one goal for grave robbers like these, right, Flame Emperor? You're here to steal the treasure that rests within the Holy Tomb."
6945,"Flame Emperor: For a fool, you catch on quickly. Those Crest Stones will be ours. That infernal power, which is masquerading as a medicine but is truly a poison, will plague this world no longer."

6957,Edelgard: Take away every last one of those Crest Stones.
6958,Rhea: That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!
6959,Flame Emperor: Take away the Crest Stones. All of them!
6960,Rhea: That is enough! Do you even know what those stones are?!
6961,"Metodey: I'm told it's fine to kill those who resist. Now then, how shall I cook you?"
6962,Metodey: Wait... No! I was just following orders! I just... Graaargh!
6963,"Edelgard: Despite what I said, I have no intention of killing you. So why not stand down and get out of my way?"
6964,"Edelgard: Professor, I will make no excuses. Thank you for all that you did for me. In truth-- No. Let's leave it at that."
6965,Edelgard: You could have had a peaceful life... Why did you have to come to Garreg Mach?
6966,Constance: What has possessed you to go through with this?!
6967,"Edelgard: I have considered every angle. I have wavered and suffered, and now my resolve is firm. Now confess... Had I told you, would you have kept my secret?"
6968,Constance: Absolutely not! I would have moved against you without a moment's hesitation!
6969,Edelgard: As I thought. That is precisely why I did not tell you. Now get out of my way.
6970,Edelgard: So the end has come...
6971,Flame Emperor: You wish to interfere? Then your life is forfeit.
6972,Flame Emperor: You are the one person I did not wish to make an enemy of...
6973,Dimitri: Do not try to say you have forgotten... Do you know just how many people died in Duscur?
6974,Flame Emperor: Why bother with this? Stay silent and fight.
6975,Dimitri: So you want to turn your eyes away from the lives you have trampled? Dastard! You are a monster. The lowliest beast I have ever known.
6976,"Claude: So, you're the fabled Flame Emperor? Go ahead and enlighten me. What are you planning to do with the Crest Stones? What did you use Flayn's blood for? Who's Kronya? Who's Solon?"
6977,Flame Emperor: Silence. There is no need for you to know.
6978,"Claude: Is it that mask that's to blame for your curtness? If so, maybe I should rip it off and ask again."
6979,Flame Emperor: Ugh...
6980,Dimitri: ... (With a shocked expression)
6981,(The Flame Emperor's masked battle model is replaced with Edelgard's unmasked Flame Emperor model.)
6982,Edelgard: So the end has come...
6983,Claude: Is this some sick joke? The Flame Emperor is actually Edelgard?!
6984,Dimitri: Is this some kind of twisted joke?!
6985,"Dimitri: I've been looking for you... I will take that head from your shoulders, and hang it from the gates of Enbarr!"
6986,Imperial Soldier: Stop right there!
6987,"Edelgard: (distressed sound, displayed as ""..."")"
6988,"Dimitri: Before I break your neck, there is one thing I must ask you."
6989,Edelgard: Stay out of my way.
6990,Dimitri: I don't recall giving you permission to speak. Answer my question. That is all you have left to do. Flame Emperor...no. Edelgard. Tell me now. Why did you cause such a tragedy?
6991,"Edelgard: (angry sound, displayed as ""..."")"
6992,"Dimitri: You killed your own mother, and yet you haven't even had the decency to stop and consider the reasons behind your actions. Have you?!"
6993,"Edelgard: I already told you, I had nothing to do with that."
6994,Dimitri: Ha! It was foolish to think I could reason with a lowly beast.
6995,"Imperial Soldier: Your Majesty, now!"
6996,Dimitri: You are a monster...
6997,"Edelgard: Come, Hubert!"
6998,"Rhea: To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren. That crime will never be erased, even if you burn in the eternal flames, and spill all of your blood into the goddess's soil!"
6999,"Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action."
7000,Dimitri: Ngah...
7001,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you OK?
Choice 2: I can't believe it. Edelgard..."
7002,Choice 1: Are you OK?
7003,Choice 2: I can't believe it. Edelgard...
7004,Dimitri: We weren't able to defeat her.
7005,Dedue: Your Highness...
7006,"Dimitri: I will kill Edelgard. With my own hands. I swear it! (Calmly to Byleth) Let's return to the monastery, Professor. It is clear what must be done."
7007,"Rhea: You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church... (to Byleth) Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of Fódlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating."
7008,"Edelgard: I have achieved my objective. I will retreat. Farewell, Professor. If we meet again, it will be on the battlefield."
7009,"Edelgard: Come, Hubert!"
7010,"Rhea: To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished!

7011,"Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action."
7012,"Claude: I'm not exactly on friendly terms with the princess, but I do have a few questions for her. Edelgard said that the Crest Stones represent power. That means she knows how to use them. She almost certainly knows other secrets of Fódlan as well... Once things calm down a bit, there's a lot more that Rhea needs to tell us."
7013,Claude: I just hope there's still time. I have this strange feeling... that history is being written. That an age of anarchy is upon us. Let's hope I'm mistaken.
7014,"Rhea: You have disappointed me, Edelgard. To think that a descendant of House Hresvelg would dare betray the holy church..."
7015,"Edelgard: So, it is my teacher who stands in my way. I always knew it would come to this..."
7016,"Rhea: Professor, kill Edelgard at once. She is a danger to all of Fódlan. Such a rebellious heart cannot be allowed to keep beating."
7017,Edelgard: I will withdraw... for now.
7018,"Edelgard: Come, Hubert!"
7019,"Rhea: To flee is futile, wicked girl. The Church of Seiros will raise its entire army against you, until you have been captured and punished! You have defiled the Holy Tomb, dishonored the goddess, and humiliated your brethren.

7020,"Rhea: Come, Professor. Let us return and decide upon our next course of action."
7021,Rhea: You... How dare you!
7022,"Edelgard: (In shock) My teacher, I-- Thank you! But are you certain that-- No, now isn't the time for discussion."
7023,"Hubert: Words cannot properly express my gratitude, Professor."
7024,"Rhea: So, this is the choice you have made. You are just another failure. Your presence soils this Holy Tomb, and disgraces my brethren. I will not allow one who would lend our enemies strength... to wield the power of the goddess Sothis. I have passed judgement. And now, I shall rip your chest open... and TAKE BACK YOUR HEART MYSELF!"
7025,Hubert: (Chuckles) That must be the Immaculate One...
7026,Edelgard: Yes. The monsters that have controlled Fódlan in secret for far too long. Rhea is their leader.
7027,"Hubert: There is no time to waste. Your Majesty, Professor, we must escape while we can.

7029,"Seteth: Edelgard and Hubert have disappeared. They will surely return to the Empire. The knights have been dispatched to search and investigate. If there is any movement, we will know. We cannot ignore the possibility that there will soon be open hostilities between us and the Imperial army. When that happens, are you prepared to fight your own? If you wish to return to the Empire, I will not stop you. That is your choice to make."
7030,"Ferdinand: If Edelgard is acting afoul, then we have no choice but to strike her down."
7031,Caspar: It's up to us to stop them! We have a war on our hands!
7032,"Linhardt: I have no interest in fighting, not even for her. And yet--"
7033,Bernadetta: How are we supposed to decide just like that?
7034,"Dorothea: Edie, Hubie, I'm sorry about this, but... I'm siding with the professor."
7035,Petra: Her doings are wrong. It is our duty to make everything right.
7036,"Seteth: I am sure you all have much on your mind. I encourage you to confer with your professor and make a decision. You have until the fighting commences. (To Byleth) Professor, I am depending on your strength for the safety of Fódlan."
7037,"Edelgard: The leaders of the church have misused its creed to fulfill their true desire - to rule the world. They have fooled the people of Fódlan. Long ago, they divided the Empire to create a Kingdom, and then, divided that Kingdom to create an Alliance. They did all of this to make the masses bicker amongst themselves. They caused instability in order to reinforce their own authority. They gathered gold and lived in extravagance. How? By preying on the devotion of those who wished for the goddess's salvation! Those corrupt hypocrites cannot lead Fódlan to true peace! Their foul belief system must be torn asunder so that true wisdom may finally prevail! And so, I have decided-- by order of the Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg-- the Empire hereby declares war on the Church of Seiros!"

7042,Ingrid: You're wrong! I'm sure of it. There has to be an explanation...
7043,Sylvain: I knew he'd been carrying the burden of that tragedy. I understand his thirst for revenge. His family and closest friends...all massacred right in front of him. But...it still doesn't add up. There must be more that we don't know.

7073,"Together, the people of Fódlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends. They recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike, but each person must still walk their chosen path alone. With each day, the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky. A silent reminder, perhaps, of some inescapable truth...

7101,"Narrator: In Imperial Year 1181, the new Adrestian emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial army. After a hard fought battle, she was forced to retreat to Fhirdiad, the capital of Faerghus, where she must now plan her next move. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of Fódlan has begun.
"
7102,Edelgard: We somehow managed to escape.
7103,Hubert: This is one of the Imperial army's provisional camps. Here we can organize our forces.
7104,"Edelgard: Before we go any further, I want all of you to really ask yourselves if you're certain you wish to join us. As expected, Flayn has chosen to leave our ranks."
7105,"Caspar: When I saw our professor running off, I ran about as fast as I could to catch up."
7106,"Petra: Caspar. Death finds those who run without thinking. You gave no thought to the war fog. (to Edelgard) My grandfather was the leader of Brigid, and I hope for us to be allies with the Empire. I will be staying."
7107,"Bernadetta: W-Was this a good idea? Did I make the right choice? Oh, but my family is part of the Empire, and our professor is here..."
7108,"Caspar: You're fine here with us, Bernie. Though it's true that certain houses were against the Imperial princess..."
7109,Ferdinand: I assume you are referring to my family. I must believe that the conclusion I came to was the correct one. (to Edelgard) You are the emperor now... I am the only one left who is qualified to guide you at this point.
7110,Linhardt: I'm only here because I know it would be troublesome to stand against you.
7111,"Dorothea: I'm not just here for you, Edie. I'm here to follow our dear professor. Of course, I don't have any territory to offer... so Hubie may not even want me here."
7112,"Hubert: The greater our numbers, the better. Your reasons for being here are of no consequence."
7113,"Edelgard: I think I understand where you are coming from. But now, I wish to hear of your resolve. Like you, I have risen to meet my destiny. I cut this path, and I will see it through to the end. Following me is akin to pointing a sword to the goddess herself. One misstep, and we fall to ruin. You have now witnessed the archbishop's true self. She is a cruel beast. Those who rule this world use that beast's power to fabricate miracles, all to control those who blindly believe in the goddess. They conceal the truth and force their lies on the nobility. They mercilessly annihilate anyone who defies them. I know this because I have lived it. After what you have seen, is there any room for doubt? The Church of Seiros has great influence and power. Their control over the lords of the Kingdom and the Alliance is nearly absolute. We are the only ones who can stop this indomitable enemy that has plagued our world for ages. We fight for humanity! For all of Fódlan! If you dare walk this path with me, take your first step. It's now or never!"
7114,"Edelgard: Thank you, my friends. We are the true face of the Empire, and we will triumph!"
7115,"Hubert: That was incredible, Lady Edelgard."
7116,"Edelgard: Thank you. Honestly, I'm relieved. They really chose to follow me... I was resolved to move forward alone if I had to, but in my heart I hoped it wouldn't come to that."
7117,"Hubert: So long as I am here, you will never be alone. Please do not forget that. And...it would seem that the professor also has a key role to play in this."
7118,"Edelgard: You're right. Now, I must speak with our teacher. Please, make preparations. The messenger should be here shortly."
7119,Hubert: Consider it done.
7120,"Edelgard: Professor, may I speak with you?"
7121,Byleth: Of course.
7122,Edelgard: I appreciate it. I...
7123,Byleth: What's wrong?
7124,"Edelgard: I'm just...anxious. It feels like the weight of this burden is crushing me. At this very moment, on my orders, I'm starting a war. An army far larger than the one that attacked the Holy Tomb last month will soon be locked in battle. Long-devised strategies are unfolding across Fódlan. Leaders are deciding their loyalties and preparing to fight... So many generals and soldiers will die. It's inevitable that civilians will get caught up in the chaos as well. There will be countless casualties. With a single command, the flames of war will rage across all corners of this realm. And I am the one who is giving the order."
7125,"Choice 1: This is the path you chose, isn't it?
Edelgard: Yes, it is. There is no turning back."
7126,"Edelgard: Yes, it is. There is no turning back."
7127,"Choice 2: Do you wish to stop?
Edelgard: No. There is no turning back now."
7128,Edelgard: No. There is no turning back now.
7129,"Edelgard: No matter how much blood flows at my feet, I will not relent. We must break the bonds that the depraved church has placed on Fódlan. These sacrifices will allow us to create a future where we never need sacrifice again. It may seem contradictory, but it's the only way. Heh. Listen to me. I made up my mind long ago. Yet here I am, seeking your approval. Tell me the truth, my teacher. Are you happy with your decision to stand by my side. Unlike me, you can still walk away from all of this. This path leads to the death of the archbishop and the servants of the church. Can you live with that?"
7130,Byleth: I chose this path too.
7131,"Edelgard: I never thought... I'm sorry. It was a foolish question. I believe in you, professor. And you believed in me. With that knowledge, I have the strength to keep fighting. Let's go... There's something I need to say to Hubert."
7132,"Hubert: Your Majesty, the latest report indicates that our main army is advancing as planned. Also, the preparations for your manifesto are almost complete."
7133,Byleth: Manifesto?
7134,Edelgard: We will distributing our manifesto to every lord within Fódlan. We will expose the dark side of the Church of Seiros and the foul practices of the nobles from the Kingdom and the Alliance. We will force the people of Fódlan to open their eyes to the truth and relinquish any remaining conviction to unite against the empire. Certain nobles have already offered their support.
7135,Hubert: There are other nobles who oppose the church. We will condemn those who deserve condemnation and forgive those who deserve forgiveness. We have already purged some of the Imperial nobles who are morally rotten. My father among them. How unfortunate.
7136,"Edelgard: And soon we will invade and conquer Garreg Mach. Our main army has already departed the Imperial capital. They will arrive at the monastery in two weeks' time. There, we will join forces with them. As for us, I'd like your opinion on how we should be positioned within the army."
7137,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We are the Imperial shield.
Choice 2: We are the Imperial sword."
7138,Choice 1: We are the Imperial shield.
7139,Choice 2: We are the Imperial sword.
7140,"Hubert: Your majesty wishes to fight alongside the professor, correct? In that case, you will not be incorporated into the Empire's main army. Your squad can move freely about the battlefield under supervision of the Imperial forces... That would be most prudent."
7141,"Edelgard: Now that I'm the emperor, we can't let it slip that I'm following your command in battle, Professor."
7142,Hubert: I fully object to the notion of you fighting on the front lines.
7143,Edelgard: Hubert. We've already discussed this.
7144,Hubert: My apologies... I overstepped.
7145,"Edelgard: Now that the details are settled, all that's left is come up with a name for ourselves. In honor at our time at the academy, how about we call ourselves the Black Eagle Strike Force?
Choice 1: I love it. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: I'm so happy you feel that way. I must confess that I spent all night thinking about it.
Choice 2: I hope we can live up to that name.
Edelgard: With you as our leader, I'm confident we will. To me, that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn, freely as an eagle.
Choice 3: Isn't that a bit much? (Relationship with Edelgard down)
Edelgard: It seems we have differing tastes. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree."
7146,"Choice 1: I love it. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: I'm so happy you feel that way. I must confess that I spent all night thinking about it."
7147,Edelgard: I'm so happy you feel that way. I must confess that I spent all night thinking about it.
7148,"Choice 2: I hope we can live up to that name.
Edelgard: With you as our leader, I'm confident we will. To me, that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn, freely as an eagle."
7149,"Edelgard: With you as our leader, I'm confident we will. To me, that name represents us soaring toward a new dawn, freely as an eagle."
7150,"Choice 3: Isn't that a bit much? (Relationship with Edelgard down)
Edelgard: It seems we have differing tastes. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree."
7151,Edelgard: It seems we have differing tastes. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.
7152,Edelgard: I'll leave it to you to prepare the Black Eagle Strike Force for departure.
7153,"Edelgard: We will join forces with the main army and attack Garreg Mach. It's a fortress built on steep ground, but it's never seen battle. That means we don't know much about it from a military perspective. But if we use all of the power at our disposal, we will capture it."
7154,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I wonder if we can win.
Choice 2: We have to try. (Relationship goes up)"
7155,Choice 1: I wonder if we can win.
7156,Choice 2: We have to try. (Relationship goes up)
7157,"Edelgard: From a purely mathematical standpoint, we most certainly have the power to win. If the battle becomes a clash of beasts with inhuman strength... You will be our only hope. I believe in you. I'm relying on you to lead the Black Eagle Strike Force to victory."
7158,Hubert: It is not up to Her Majesty to bring the students to our cause. That task falls to you. Those who have forsaken their homelands to join the Empire will be feeling...vulnerable. You are uniquely able to provide emotional support. Please use that gift to guide others down the path that Lady Edelgard has laid before us. I ask you to do this from the bottom of my heart.
7159,"Ferdinand: I asked Edelgard what happened to my father. He was dismissed as prime minister and is under arrest in the Imperial capital. He always was a greedy, arrogant man. Some would say that this is the fate he deserves. And yet I cannot help but feel indignant. After all his hard work for the Empire, to be disgraced like this! I am conflicted, Professor. I do not know what to do. As the next Duke Aegir, should I follow Edelgard into battle?"
7160,"Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing..."
7161,"Caspar: That could have gotten dangerous fast. If I stayed at the monastery, I would've had to fight my father! We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! Anyway, it looks like he's going to be leading the western units. I wonder if we'll wind up fighting the Kingdom's army, and who decided to fight for the church..."
7162,"Bernadetta: I don't even get my own room here! At least I had that at home. But speaking of home, Hubert told me something. He said my father was stripped of his title. I guess he did as he pleased and opposed Edelgard. Wait, does that mean my father's going to be home all the time now? On second thought, I think I'm fine right here."
7163,"Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win?"
7164,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's worrisome.
Dorothea: It is. We might have to fight against others from the academy, and that's... I can't think about it.
Choice 2: We will not lose. (Relationship goes up)
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're fighting the Knights of Seiros! Still, I know you'll figure something out."
7165,"Choice 1: It's worrisome.
Dorothea: It is. We might have to fight against others from the academy, and that's... I can't think about it."
7166,"Dorothea: It is. We might have to fight against others from the academy, and that's... I can't think about it."
7167,"Choice 2: We will not lose. (Relationship goes up)
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're fighting the Knights of Seiros! Still, I know you'll figure something out."
7168,"Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're fighting the Knights of Seiros! Still, I know you'll figure something out."
7169,"Petra: The Empire and Brigid were once warring with each other. But now, I have made the decision to be fighting with the Empire. It is a choice of irony, I feel. But I am having no regret. My belief is with you and with Edelgard."
7170,"Felix: I've been preparing to take this path. My own path--not my old man's, and not the boar's."
7171,"Ashe: I can't bring myself to trust the Church of Seiros. Not after they killed Lonato and my brother. I need to know the truth. Even if it means...turning my weapon on Faerghus. I guess Lonato would be happy to hear me say that, if he were still around."
7172,"Sylvain: I've gone and done it now, huh? What would my old man say if he knew I'd sided with the Empire? His Highness must be angry. Dimitri gets super scary when he's like that. I wonder how I'm going to die... Ugh, my knees turn to jelly just thinking about it. No, I can't think that way. I promised to fight alongside you. I'm here until the end. Heh, listen to me. I'm terrified, but I feel so calm."
7173,"Mercedes: Surely this is what the goddess willed, isn't it? I feel she would not have wanted the Church of Seiros to become what it has..."
7174,"Annette: Um, Professor... I'm OK with fighting whoever we need to, but I really don't want to battle my father... Oh, but I know that something is wrong with the church... And more than that, I believe in you, and I trust your word. You lead and I'll follow."
7175,"Ingrid: I may return to Galatea territory and try to convince my father to join our cause. It's possible that... No. In my heart, I know that my father won't never listen. Still, I must get him to see reason. That this is the only way to ensure our family's future."
7176,"Lorenz: I've decided to ally myself with Lady Edelgard. Father will doubtless understand my reasoning. House Gloucester has always had good intentions in its dealings with the Empire. Of course, this does mean that I will no longer be able to avoid a confrontation with Claude. It is unfortunate. We were classmates, after all."
7177,"Raphael: No need to worry about me. I got no complaints as long as my little sis is safe. Sure, I lived on Alliance land, but that doesn't mean I served their lords. I'm sure this is the right path, seeing as you're the one who picked it, Professor!"
7178,"Ignatz: To think that things would come to this. Even a few months ago, I never could've imagined it. I believe in you, Professor, so I'm steeling myself. I can't promise that I'll be useful in battle, but I'm not running away from the fight."
7179,"Lysithea: If the church is behind the current state of things--this society in which only Crests are valued--then I have no need of it. Edelgard is taking the shortest path to change. No matter how drastic her measures, I agree that this is the only way. That said, if Edelgard strays from her noble path, I trust you will set her straight again. Won't you? I am counting on you, Professor."
7180,Marianne: Imagine making half the world your enemy for the sake of realizing your own ideals... Edelgard is so radiant and strong compared to someone like me... What if I have the power to change the world too? Even just a little bit...
7181,"Leonie: So, you've turned against the church to ally with the Empire too, huh? I never pressed him for details, but Captain Jeralt was always suspicious of Lady Rhea, wasn't he? I'm on your side, no matter what. I promised him I'd support you, and that's what I plan to do."
7182,"Yuri: Surprised that I'm here, are you? I know a winning side when I see one. I mean there is no way I'd risk my neck and my people by willingly joining a losing battle."
7183,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You really care for them? (Relationship with Yuri up)"
7184,Choice 1: You really care for them? (Relationship with Yuri up)
7185,"Yuri: I do. We will see how this all shakes out. It all depends on how we, and you fight.
Choice 2: Do you feel you chose wisely?"
7186,Choice 2: Do you feel you chose wisely?
7187,"Yuri: You better hope I did, otherwise we'd both be dead."
7188,"Yuri: Regardless of who comes after us, even if it's the knights. We have you on our side, so it'll all be fine."
7189,"Balthus: What's the deal, pal? You don't want me here? Come on, have a heart. This side is where all the action is! Look, I'll level with you. I want to help that Edelgard gal achieve her goal. I mean it. If Her Majesty gets what she's after...My mother will... Eh, forget it, now's not the time. We've got to keep our heads in the game so we can win, yeah? Having Yuri on our side will help things! He's not someone you want as an enemy."
7190,"Constance: I knew nothing of Lady Edelgard's past or of her innermost feelings. But I know now, I persuaded her to tell all. It would have been rude to hound her relentlessly until she revealed herself, yes? Then that is certainly not what I did! Ahaha!"
7191,"Hapi: With the empire taking over Garreg Mach, I wonder what will happen to Abyss? Some people have spent their whole lives there. For their sake, I hope Abyss doesn't get trampled into ruin."
7192,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can't guarantee anything."
7193,Choice 1: I can't guarantee anything.
7194,"Hapi: Yeah. I guess all I can do is talk about it with Eddy, I mean, Her Majesty.
Choice 2: I promise to protect them. (Relationship with Hapi up)"
7195,Choice 2: I promise to protect them. (Relationship with Hapi up)
7196,"Hapi: Thanks. You should try talking about it with Eddy I mean, Her Majesty. She might listen to you."
7197,"Hapi: Also this is less important, but if someone trashes my room, I'm gonna be mad."
7198,"Ladislava: I believe this is the first time we have met. My name is Ladislava. I have the great honor of leading Lady Edelgard's personal guard. Her majesty is hard on others as she is on herself. She may seem composed, but that is only because she conceals her more passionate emotions. For that reason, she is often misunderstood. But now she has you by her side... I find that most reassuring. I look forward to working with you."
7199,"Randolph: I'm Randolph von Bergliez. I'm not very high in the ranks yet, but I'm more or less a general. Just like Caspar, I am from House Bergliez. My mother married into House Bergliez after I was born, so my position within the family is rather lowly... But I'm determined to make something of myself in this battle to bring glory to my part of the family, for the sake of my mother and sister!"
7200,Soldier: I have heard the name Lord Vestra mentioned among the purged noble families of the Empire. He's Hubert's father. But Hubert seems rather unconcerned about it... That alone is why we soldiers find Hubert quite frightening.
7201,"Soldier: The Black Eagle Strike Force, eh? I like it. It's really a twist of fate that brought me to this side of things, but I'm still proud to be here."
7202,"Soldier: I'm a soldier, but I had to think long and hard about this one. Since birth, I've believed in the teachings of Seiros without ever questioning them. But Her Majesty's words are true. To think that the archbishop can take on such a monstrous form..."
7203,"Student: I came this far mostly on impulse, but I wonder if it was the right choice... Everything will be OK, right, Professor? I'm not wrong, am I? If I know that you think it's OK, I feel like it will be easier to believe in myself..."
7204,"Student: To be frank, I'm not sure whether I should believe all that Edelgard says. But if her words are true...I think it's best to be her ally. So I'll fight. I'm not at ease with that decision just yet, but I'll stick by it."
7205,"Edelgard: We will soon arrive at Garreg Mach Monastery. Forcing a surrender here is extremely significant, both strategically and symbolically. Of course, this is personal as well. This is where we all came together to learn and grow. I have no intention of yielding to our former classmates, so I ask that you prepare yourselves for anything."
7206,"Linhardt: I'm not thinking about friends right now, and I'm certainly not prepared."
7207,"Caspar: Damn it, don't go around saying things that lower morale before we even get started! I'm ready! Let's go! Let's fight!"
7208,Dorothea: I have nothing to lose aside from my friends who are here with me. Does that answer satisfy you?
7209,Petra: I have been ready for this since leaving my land of home. I will fight and win!
7210,Bernadetta: How can you prepare to fight? Maybe I can prepare to prepare...
7211,Ferdinand: There is no reason I cannot be prepared. It is my duty to stand up and battle!
7212,"Edelgard: Thank you all. Now, let's talk strategy."
7213,"Hubert: As the raiding force, we will attack the area nearest to the monastery. The Knights of Seiros certainly won't stand down after they catch sight of Her Majesty and the professor. At the same time, the remaining areas will be surrounded and annihilated by the main army. In other words, we are the decoy that must suppress the enemy's most elite soldiers."
7214,"Edelgard: We know more about the area near the monastery than anyone else in the Imperial army. Still, we must prepare for the worst. It's possible we will have to face the archbishop's true form--the Immaculate One. Fight with all you have, but don't be reckless. As promised, I will leave the command to the professor."
7215,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We will not lose.
Hubert: Naturally. With both Her Majesty and yourself on our side, defeat is impossible.
Choice 2: I will protect you all.
Hubert: Not only will we all survive this, but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious."
7216,"Choice 1: We will not lose.
Hubert: Naturally. With both Her Majesty and yourself on our side, defeat is impossible."
7217,"Hubert: Naturally. With both Her Majesty and yourself on our side, defeat is impossible."
7218,"Choice 2: I will protect you all.
Hubert: Not only will we all survive this, but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious."
7219,"Hubert: Not only will we all survive this, but we will undoubtedly emerge victorious."
7220,Edelgard: This will be our first battle as the Black Eagle Strike Force. All the more reason to prevail!
7221,Suggested Level: 25
7222,Victory Conditions: Rout the enemy.
7223,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle."
7224,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
7225,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle.
7226,"Seteth: Friends! Our opportunity for victory will come, but first we must see to our defenses!"
7227,Hubert: The city's defenders are trying to stall for time. We must crush them swiftly. We should be wary of ambushes as well.
7228,Edelgard: Ladislava is being pushed on the left flank. We must push back with equal force.
7229,Ladislava: Just what we need! I knew Her Majesty's allies would help us out.
7230,"Ladislava: Apologies for the trouble, Your Majesty!"
7231,"Knight of Seiros: Now! Hidden Soldiers, attack!"
7232,Flayn: You shall not pass! I will protect Garreg Mach!
7233,"Flayn: Professor, why?! Do you not see the cruelty of this?"
7234,Flayn: Must protect...Garreg Mach... I must protect...everyone...
7235,"Seteth: Retreat while you still can, Flayn! I beg you! (If Seteth was not defeated)"
7236,Flayn: Understood... Stay safe Fa--Brother! (If Seteth was not defeated)
7237,Death Knight: We will lend the Empire strength...
7238,Byleth: ?!
7239,"Edelgard: Don't worry. We're allies now... I understand you must have many questions, but they'll have to wait until after the battle."
7240,"Gilbert: Unfortunately, you must die here. You should never have defied the goddess."
7241,Gilbert: If you side with the Empire... If you turn your sword on the church and the Kingdom... I care not who you are. I will end you just the same.
7242,"Gilbert: Annette, throw down your arms!"
7243,"Annette: I'm sorry, Father. But I have made my choice. I'm not going back to the monastery, to the Kingdom, or to you, Father!"
7244,"Gilbert: Forgive me, Goddess. Annette. If you side with the Empire, I will have no choice but to kill you."
7245,"Gilbert: In my master's name, I cannot allow myself to fall here... I must withdraw."
7246,Seteth: You will survive this hardship! Just hold on! (If Seteth was not defeated)
7247,Seteth: I will show no mercy to anyone who attacks Rhea!
7248,Seteth: Traitor! I will not forgive you for turning on Rhea!
7249,Seteth: I cannot yield...
7250,"Flayn: Seteth! Please, do not overextend yourself! I am still in this fight! (If Flayn was not defeated)"
7251,"Seteth: I'm sorry, Flayn... Withdraw if you must... (If Flayn was not defeated)"
7252,"Rhea: Seteth, Flayn, Gilbert... You put your lives on the line to protect us. I would have preferred to have more time to prepare, but we cannot delay any longer. Come forth! Protect Garreg Mach Monastery from these despicable rebels!"
7253,"Rhea: Seteth, Flayn, Gilbert ... You have done well to hold out as long as you have. Now it is time to deploy our strongest military power. The counterattack begins! Come forth! Protect Garreg Mach Monastery from those despicable rebels!"
7254,Catherine: I'll crush them all.
7255,Cyril: Her enemies are my enemies.
7256,"Catherine: I am Thunder Catherine, and I will slay all of Lady Rhea's enemies. Including you."
7257,Catherine: I trusted you. Lady Rhea trusted you. I won't let you live after what you've done.
7258,"Catherine: Lady Rhea, I'm sorry. Please stay safe."
7259,"Rhea: All is well, Catherine. You must not die here."
7260,Cyril: I gotta kill you!
7261,"Cyril: I'll protect Lady Rhea against anyone! Even if it's you, I'll fight ya as hard as I can!"
7262,"Cyril: Lady Rhea, I couldn't fight hard enough. I'm sorry..."
7263,Rhea: Cyril... Your sacrifice will not be in vain.
7264,Rhea: So you have sullied yourself by joining with the rebels? I hope you came prepared to breathe your last.
7265,Rhea: You... How dare you betray me... You worthless piece of garbage... I will punish you myself!
7266,"Rhea: No matter your reasons, I cannot permit you to go on living any longer!"
7267,Edelgard: The feeling is mutual. I must put a stop to your reign of tyranny!
7268,Rhea: You must know what a fool you are! The greatest of sins is to make an enemy of the goddess herself!
7269,"Edelgard: I have only made an enemy of the church, not of the faith."
7270,Rhea: Raaaargh!
7271,Rhea: I will not...allow Garreg Mach...or my mother to fall! (upon victory)
7272,The Immaculate One: You will not be forgiven!
7273,"Edelgard: Professor, look out!"
7274,Imperial Soldier: The castle is crumbling! We must escape!

7280,"It is Imperial Year 1185. Half a decade has passed since Emperor Edelgard ascended the Imperial throne, yet the continent of Fódlan still remains lost in a tempest of turmoil and bloodshed. In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, King Dimitri has welcomed Archbishop Rhea and her knights, who were driven out of Garreg Mach, to the Kingdom capital. As they work to build a unified front, the war with the Empire rages on to the west. Meanwhile, Claude, leader of the Alliance, staves off Imperial intervention by strategically stirring up conflicts between Leicester lords in an effort to feign neutrality. As events unfold, Edelgard and her Black Eagle Strike Force begin to take action in an attempt to break the war's current state of deadlock.

Meanwhile, the Black Eagle Strike Force plans to capture Alliance territory before Edelgard takes the war to the Kingdom and Church of Seiros.

Edelgard: Another joke. Or...are you telling the truth? I suppose you must be. In that case, I'll tell you all that has transpired as you slumbered these past five years."
7375,"Edelgard: Another joke. Or...are you telling the truth? I suppose you must be. In that case, I'll tell you all that has transpired as you slumbered these past five years."
7376,"Edelgard: ...And that is where we are now. The war is at a stalemate. Dimitri is the new King of Faerghus. It's clear that his territory will continue to support the Church. Meanwhile, Claude's leadership has thrown the Alliance into chaos. He maintains neutrality in their internal conflict. The situation has created a deadlock. We've been awaiting an opportunity for our squadron to return to the monastery. With you in the fray, I believe the state of the war will shift immediately. The Church, as well as the Kingdom and the Alliance... The time has come to eliminate them all."
7377,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Kingdom and the Alliance...
Edelgard: Although we were of different houses, we were companions who lived and learned together. Some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them. However, knowing that you're alive is sure to raise their spirits.
Choice 2: The Church of Seiros...
Edelgard: Rhea, Seteth, the knights, and the others are in prime condition. They've set up their base within the Kingdom capital. The Immaculate One and her family have yet to fight on the front lines. However, we must eventually face and defeat them. It would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes."
7378,"Choice 1: The Kingdom and the Alliance...
Edelgard: Although we were of different houses, we were companions who lived and learned together. Some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them. However, knowing that you're alive is sure to raise their spirits."
7379,"Edelgard: Although we were of different houses, we were companions who lived and learned together. Some of our ranks are hesitant to battle against them. However, knowing that you're alive is sure to raise their spirits."
7380,"Choice 2: The Church of Seiros...
Edelgard: Rhea, Seteth, the knights, and the others are in prime condition. They've set up their base within the Kingdom capital. The Immaculate One and her family have yet to fight on the front lines. However, we must eventually face and defeat them. It would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes."

The Immaculate One and her family have yet to fight on the front lines. However, we must eventually face and defeat them. It would mean a great deal to have you with us when the time comes."
7382,"Edelgard: Good. Well then, I believe it's time for a little reunion. The Black Eagle Strike Force never lost faith. They knew you were alive and have been awaiting your return. Let's not keep them waiting any longer."
7383,"Hubert: Well now. That face is certainly familiar. I am glad to see you alive and well, Professor."
7384,"Bernadetta: Professor, it's me, Bernie! Do you remember me? I can't believe you're here!"
7385,Caspar: I can't believe it! Is this a dream? Can we really be this lucky?!
7386,"Petra: This is not dreaming. Our professor is with us again! (To Byleth) Welcome to the back! I mean, welcome back!"
7387,Ferdinand: Our group isn't the same without you. I am overjoyed to see you again!
7388,Dorothea: It's been so long. Seeing you again fills my heart with hope.
7389,"Linhardt: Great, now everything will be easy. (To Byleth) Um, that's great you're safe, Professor. I'm deeply, deeply moved."
7390,"Edelgard: Quite the reunion, isn't it, Professor? Everyone's happy to see you."
7391,"Caspar: Come on, Edelgard. You must be happier than all of us combined!"
7392,"Caspar: She took it really hard when you disappeared, Professor."
7393,"Ferdinand: Of course, we did our very best in your absence. And there was never a day that we doubted you would return to us."
7394,"Dorothea: Edelgard has been leading us as emperor. But...after you disappeared, it became apparent that you were her anchor."
7395,"Petra: It gives me regret to be admitting this, but...our power is not enough. The only one who can be meeting Edelgard's expectations...is you, Professor."
7396,Linhardt: Most impressive of all is your uncanny ability to bring a smile to everyone's face.
7397,"Hubert: In the years since you vanished, we have not lost anyone from our ranks."
7398,Edelgard: We all longed for your presence and your leadership. Myself included.
7399,Hubert: It seems fitting to view this as a new beginning for the Black Eagle Strike Force. We already have our target.
7400,"Edelgard: Yes. We must eliminate the Alliance before moving on to fight the Kingdom and the Church. However, that doesn't necessarily mean we must occupy the entirety of the Alliance. House Riegan stands against the Empire... Therefore, our target is Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital."
7401,"Hubert: We must cross the Airmid River, which separates the Empire and the Alliance. To do that, we must take the largest bridge across it. The Great Bridge of Myrddin. Myrddin connects the monastery and the Imperial capital to the east. It is the shortest route there."
7402,"Edelgard: An Alliance stronghold has been built at the Great Bridge. We'll take that and then head north. At the same time, we must defeat the one who defends it, Judith von Daphnel. If we can also take control of Daphnel territory, it would be greatly beneficial to us. Prepare yourselves. The next battle will be a momentous one. Join me, my friends, as we begin our journey to bring peace and solace to this war-ravaged world."
7403,"Edelgard: Professor... I'm sorry to have dragged you into the fight again so soon after our reunion. But you appeared at a most opportune time. I'm truly humbled by your support, my teacher. Thank you."
7404,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You can count on me.
Edelgard: And so I will. I'm hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact.
Choice 2: I hope I'm not rusty...
Edelgard: You may be worried, but you shouldn't be. You always manage to pull through."
7405,"Choice 1: You can count on me.
Edelgard: And so I will. I'm hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact."
7406,Edelgard: And so I will. I'm hoping your ability from five years prior are still intact.
7407,"Choice 2: I hope I'm not rusty...
Edelgard: You may be worried, but you shouldn't be. You always manage to pull through."
7408,"Edelgard: You may be worried, but you shouldn't be. You always manage to pull through."
7409,"Edelgard: Make sure you're ready to head out, OK?"
7410,"Hubert: Allow me to brief you on the details of our situation. The Empire firmly controls the western portion of Faerghus. However, the central and eastern regions continue to put up heavy resistance. The strongholds in these regions are Arianrhod, the Fortress City, and Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. We cannot control Faerghus until we have taken both of these cities. As for the Alliance, Houses Gloucester and Ordelia seem predisposed to to capitulate to us. However, due to interference from Houses Riegan and Goneril, we have yet to secure their cooperation. Claude obviously hopes to keep the Alliance whole through diplomacy. But because we have had to focus our efforts against the church until now, our forces have yet to meet his. We have only recently begun to take the fight to Alliance territory."
7411,"Ferdinand: The last five years have been difficult at times. My relationship with Edelgard is rather contentious, due to the incident with my father. Nevertheless, I cannot abandon my family's duties. As Duke Aegir, I must play my part in the Imperial army. Edelgard intends to abolish the nobility, but I know I can dissuade her from doing so."
7412,"Linhardt: Professor! Do you know how happy I was to hear you were still alive? I'll tell you how happy--for the past two days, I haven't had my morning or my afternoon naps."
7413,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Morning...nap? (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes?
Choice 2: You were taking those naps every day?
Linhardt: Well, as long as we weren't marching. Can't sleep much then...but it's not for want of trying..."
7414,"Choice 1: Morning...nap? (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes?"
7415,Linhardt: Yes?
7416,"Choice 2: You were taking those naps every day?
Linhardt: Well, as long as we weren't marching. Can't sleep much then...but it's not for want of trying..."
7417,"Linhardt: Well, as long as we weren't marching. Can't sleep much then...but it's not for want of trying..."
7418,"Linhardt: By the way, with Professor Hanneman not around... I've occupied his room. So I am well equipped to perform research on you. Isn't that exciting? (If Hanneman was not recruited)"
7419,"Caspar: All right, I'm ready to fight! Let's do this!"
7420,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Whoa, slow down.
Caspar: You're right! I gotta keep it under control or I'm gonna wear myself out too quickly. Maybe I'll just get rid of a few monsters...or is that too risky right before a mission?
Choice 2: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: Leave it to me! I can take on the whole...most of the enemy's army!"
7421,"Choice 1: Whoa, slow down.
Caspar: You're right! I gotta keep it under control or I'm gonna wear myself out too quickly. Maybe I'll just get rid of a few monsters...or is that too risky right before a mission?"
7422,Caspar: You're right! I gotta keep it under control or I'm gonna wear myself out too quickly. Maybe I'll just get rid of a few monsters...or is that too risky right before a mission?
7423,"Choice 2: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: Leave it to me! I can take on the whole...most of the enemy's army!"
7424,Caspar: Leave it to me! I can take on the whole...most of the enemy's army!
7425,"Caspar: I know my limits now, Professor!"
7426,"Bernadetta: Are we leaving for battle? I heard it's a long march. But it's fine! I've had plenty of time to stay inside lately, so I think it's time I...went out. Yeah! I can do this. No more Bernie-bear!"
7427,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Bernie-bear?
Bernadetta: Oh yeah. People call me Bernie-bear since I hole up in my den all the time. Not anymore though!
Choice 2: That's the spirit. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: Yes! But, um. Please don't put me up front, OK?"
7428,"Choice 1: Bernie-bear?
Bernadetta: Oh yeah. People call me Bernie-bear since I hole up in my den all the time. Not anymore though!"
7429,Bernadetta: Oh yeah. People call me Bernie-bear since I hole up in my den all the time. Not anymore though!
7430,"Choice 2: That's the spirit. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: Yes! But, um. Please don't put me up front, OK?"
7431,"Bernadetta: Yes! But, um. Please don't put me up front, OK?"
7432,"Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history."
7433,"Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty."
7434,"Felix: For five years, I've fought for the Empire. I've cut down hordes of enemies. Now I have the same look in my eyes that the boar used to have in his. The look of a savage beast who loves nothing but destruction and violence."
7435,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't see that look in your eyes.
Felix: I hope not.
Choice 2: You're right. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: Hmph. I can hardly hold it against him anymore."
7436,"Choice 1: I don't see that look in your eyes.
Felix: I hope not."
7437,Felix: I hope not.
7438,"Choice 2: You're right. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: Hmph. I can hardly hold it against him anymore."
7439,Felix: Hmph. I can hardly hold it against him anymore.
7440,Felix: You and Edelgard must not disappoint me. Mark my words. The future you're building had better be worth all this bloodshed.
7441,"Ashe: Since you came back, everyone's been smiling. Just you being here makes an incredible difference. I can't express how reassuring it is to see you."
7442,"Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a really long time, hasn't it? The last five years have been full of heartbreak-not from girls...but friends and family becoming enemies. One of the things that kept me going was the hope you'd return, and now here you are. A lot has changed, but you're back, and it's the first time I can remember being happy in a while."
7443,"Mercedes: I have good friends in both the Alliance and Faerghus, so this fighting weighs heavily on me... I can't bear the thought of battling the Knights of Seiros to the death! I have to keep my chin up though, right? Let's press on together, Professor."
7444,"Annette: My father used to be a knight in service of the royal family of Faerghus. For a time he was at the monastery, but apparently, he's back in Faerghus serving as a knight again. Which means if I fight with this family, I'll eventually have to face my own father..."
7445,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If you want to leave, now is the time.
Annette: Don't say that! I know what I'm doing and I'm ready for anything.
Choice 2: Does that frighten you? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: Terribly. But...I've accepted my fate. I'm ready for anything."
7446,"Choice 1: If you want to leave, now is the time.
Annette: Don't say that! I know what I'm doing and I'm ready for anything."
7447,Annette: Don't say that! I know what I'm doing and I'm ready for anything.
7448,"Choice 2: Does that frighten you? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: Terribly. But...I've accepted my fate. I'm ready for anything."
7449,Annette: Terribly. But...I've accepted my fate. I'm ready for anything.
7450,"Annette: Of course, if at all possible, I would prefer not to fight my father. This is the path I chose. I have no regrets."
7451,"Ingrid: His Highness, the new king, is in process of unifying the Kingdom under his command. His powerful army has joined forces with the Knights of Seiros, who moved their seat to Faerghus. And now they're presenting a unified front against the Imperial army. They're our greatest enemy, absolutely."
7452,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I wonder if we can win.
Ingrid: Presently, it's doubtful. That's why I'm in favor of first capturing Alliance lands.
Choice 2: Can you fight against your homeland? (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: I don't relish the idea, but there's no turning back now. For now, we should focus our efforts on the Alliance. The Kingdom and church can come afterwards."
7453,"Choice 1: I wonder if we can win.
Ingrid: Presently, it's doubtful. That's why I'm in favor of first capturing Alliance lands."
7454,"Ingrid: Presently, it's doubtful. That's why I'm in favor of first capturing Alliance lands."

Ingrid: I don't relish the idea, but there's no turning back now. For now, we should focus our efforts on the Alliance. The Kingdom and church can come afterwards."
7456,"Ingrid: I don't relish the idea, but there's no turning back now. For now, we should focus our efforts on the Alliance. The Kingdom and church can come afterwards."
7457,"Ingrid: Judith, who defends the Great Bridge of Myrddin, is a formidable opponent. We can't afford to drop our guard."
7458,"Lorenz: House Gloucester will remain staunchly neutral in this war. Even if we press into Alliance territory. My father is no threat to the Empire. Lady Edelgard surely understands that. The Great Bridge of Myrddin, however, is another story. I hear it is held by Judith of House Daphnel. She is renowned for her military prowess. We would do well not to underestimate her."
7459,"Raphael: Hey, Professor! What have you been up to for five years? Hope you haven't gone soft! I got myself into perfect shape. Took all five years of pushing my muscles to the limit, but look!"
7460,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You look very strong. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: You bet I do! You gotta get training if you want to catch up!
Choice 2: I don't really see a difference...
Raphael: What?! Can't you see my muscles? Do I gotta undress so you can get a better look?"
7461,"Choice 1: You look very strong. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: You bet I do! You gotta get training if you want to catch up!"
7462,Raphael: You bet I do! You gotta get training if you want to catch up!
7463,"Choice 2: I don't really see a difference...
Raphael: What?! Can't you see my muscles? Do I gotta undress so you can get a better look?"
7464,Raphael: What?! Can't you see my muscles? Do I gotta undress so you can get a better look?
7465,"Ignatz: I thought you might be at the monastery. That's why I made my way here. I decided to follow your path, because I believed in you. But then you vanished. Now that you've returned, I have my guiding light once again. Welcome back, Professor!"
7466,"Lysithea: I'm relieved you're here, Professor. It seems we've reached a stalemate on the war front. I admit I'm feeling apprehensive about fighting the Alliance..."
7467,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You have to cast aside your doubts. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I agree. It's time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture.
Choice 2: You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.
Lysithea: No. I have to shelve my personal feelings. There are bigger things at play here."
7468,"Choice 1: You have to cast aside your doubts. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I agree. It's time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture."
7469,Lysithea: I agree. It's time to shelve my personal feelings and focus on the bigger picture.
7470,"Choice 2: You don't have to do anything if you don't want to.
Lysithea: No. I have to shelve my personal feelings. There are bigger things at play here."
7471,Lysithea: No. I have to shelve my personal feelings. There are bigger things at play here.
7472,"Lysithea: I'll fight at full force. I'm counting on you to lead us to victory, Professor."
7473,"Marianne: My adoptive father sent me here so our family name would be known. He doesn't care which side wins, the Empire or the Alliance. However, even if he tells me to come home, I intend to stay. I want to see this new world Edelgard dreams of."
7474,Leonie: I'm so glad to see you're all right. I really regretted not being able to keep the promise I made to my mentor.
7475,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Mentor?
Leonie: Captain Jeralt, obviously! I'm still his first and greatest apprentice, you know!
Choice 2: Promise? (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: Captain Jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him, then I should stick by you."
7476,"Choice 1: Mentor?
Leonie: Captain Jeralt, obviously! I'm still his first and greatest apprentice, you know!"
7477,"Leonie: Captain Jeralt, obviously! I'm still his first and greatest apprentice, you know!"
7478,"Choice 2: Promise? (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: Captain Jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him, then I should stick by you."
7479,"Leonie: Captain Jeralt told me that if anything should happen to him, then I should stick by you."
7480,Leonie: I'm going to do just what he asked. I'll be right here to support you from now on.
7481,Alois: Ah!
7482,Byleth: Ah?
7483,"Alois: At long last, we meet again! I knew you were alive. I knew you could survive. And five years on, you arrive! We're reunited! I'm glad I kept watch for you in the downstream villages all that time. I was so devoted to finding you that I left the Knights of Seiros. Now I serve no one... Other than you! I'll protect you, just as I promised Captain Jeralt I would all those years ago."
7484,Shamir: What's that look on your face? Surprised to see me? I'm a mercenary. Always have been. Even when I was with the Knights of Seiros. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon. But I might change my mind if you're around.
7485,"Hanneman: You've finally joined us, haven't you? I attached myself to the Imperial army as well. Seemed the thing to do. I feel I owe it to Edelgard to set my past feelings about the Empire aside. I am happy to help her. It's strange, isn't it? After five years, the three Professors are together once more. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail."
7486,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Choice 2: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
7487,"Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course."
7488,"Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course."

Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
7490,"Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
7491,"Manuela: After the battle five years ago, the Imperial army occupied Garreg Mach. The cathedral and several other buildings were destroyed, but... We've done some repair work here and there, and we're using the buildings as a base of operations. As for me? Well, the church moved its headquarters to Faerghus, and I've seen no reason to follow. When I returned to Enbarr, I received a summons from Her Majesty, and I chose to answer."
7492,"Jeritza: You survived. How very fortunate... Were you dead, I wouldn't be able to fight you. But you are very much alive—now I've a chance to kill you."
7493,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
7494,"Randolph: Ah, a new face. I am Randolph von Bergliez. I'm the guardian of this place. Wait a moment... I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before."
7495,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Five years ago...
Choice 2: I'm a professor."
7496,Choice 1: Five years ago...
7497,Choice 2: I'm a professor.
7498,"Randolph: Ah yes! You're Her Majesty's professor. You're alive?! Um... Oh, this is my little sister, Fleche. She's just a rookie, but she's helping me as my assistant."
7499,"Fleche: H-Hello. I'm Fleche von Bergliez. It's nice to meet you. I know I'm inexperienced, but I'm going to do my best. You can count on me to look after my big brother!"
7500,Randolph: I heard you're planning to march into Alliance territory. I'll be here to guard the fort.
7501,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! What's that? Do I have brothers in the church? You really are well informed! My older twin works for the Knights of Seiros, but I think he's just a grunt. Not a noble gate keeper like yours truly. Unlike me, he's very devout. He left the Empire a long time ago."
7502,"Soldier: The north side of the Great Bridge of Myrddin is in the territory of Acheron of the Alliance. He's known as ""the weathervane."" He's a notoriously flippant man. A man like that doesn't have the guts to give it all for the defense of that bridge."
7503,"Citizen: I've been working here for a few years now. There are plenty of others working here too. Since the acolytes and students aren't here, it's up to us to pick up the slack."
7504,"Soldier: By making an enemy of the church, disorder is running rampant among the populace. It's quieted down over these last five years though. The well-being of Her Majesty is steadily improving."
7505,"Merchant: Since the great nobles lost their standing, the regulation of the merchant houses has relaxed somewhat. You'd probably have thought that would make it easier for us to profit...but the world isn't so simple. The war has made the price of goods unstable, causing no end of hardship for the people."
7506,"Soldier: There were clashes with the Kingdom army near the western front, but this is the first time the Alliance army has had an honest-to-goodness fight. I hear their leader's pretty competent, but the Alliance army is pretty tough too."
7507,"Soldier: Within the territories of the Alliance, the Gloucester and Daphnel houses dominate the west. House Gloucester has always supported the Empire. There's not much chance of them defying us. So all that needs to be done to restore peace in the west now is to crush House Daphnel."
7508,"Artisan: I was so surprised to hear that the faith of Seiros was a sham, my eyes nearly popped out of my skull. But just because the church lied to us doesn't mean that the goddess isn't real. That's my take on it, anyway. I'd feel very anxious with no one to pray to..."
7509,"Scholar: It's normal for history to be revised in favor of those who hold the power. The documents in this library are no exception. It's perfectly possible for someone to have made edits to them. But it's my belief that no one has the power to blot out the truth entirely. I like to read the same texts over and over again. That way, I can spot some of the truths hidden between the lines..."
7510,"Yuri: Huh... Is that... It is you, isn't it? I kinda forgot what you looked like."
7511,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You've changed too.
Yuri: No doubt. A lot can happen in five years. A baby goes from crawling and babbling to walking and talking in that time.
Choice 2: Ouch... (Relationship with Yuri goes up.)
Yuri: Aw, I didn't mean any harm. It's just that so much has happened. It's hard to keep track, you know?"
7512,"Choice 1: You've changed too.

7515,"Yuri: Aw, I didn't mean any harm. It's just that so much has happened. It's hard to keep track, you know?"
7516,"Yuri: Anyway, you came back, and that's what matters. Staying here wasn't a mistake. I can say that much."
7517,"Balthus: Hey, pal. You've got a lot of nerve coming here after ignoring us for five years! Ha! Got ya! All this time, and you still can't take a joke, can ya? Good job surviving and clawing your way back to us. This day couldn't get better if it tried."
7518,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's nice to see you too.
Choice 2: I didn't expect such a warm reception."
7519,Choice 1: It's nice to see you too.
7520,Choice 2: I didn't expect such a warm reception.
7521,"Balthus: Heh. Say, now that you're back, we should celebrate with some liquid gold. We're not your students anymore, so it should be fine, yeah? Oh... I like this idea. We'll make it a wild party! Even the emperor won't be able to turn it down."
7522,"Constance: If you haven't heard, we'll soon be launching a full-scale assault on the Alliance. Her Majesty has searched relentlessly for you. Now that you're found, her moment has come."

I've been here the whole time. Day in and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be. The Imperial Army hasn't interfered with us all that much, so it's business as usual here in Abyss. I mean, as usual as it gets here, anyhow."
7536,Rogue: A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started. People are saying it was the church that used to keep order around here. But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.
7537,"Resident: I used to be a rather important person in the church, but...I am in exile for committing a crime. I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed! My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church wasn't putting in enough to rebuild..."
7538,Hubert: Would you assist us in securing more resources?
7539,"Hubert: Thank you for helping to gather resources. Please accept this simple gift, by way of compensation."
7540,Soldier: Some soldiers stationed at Fódlan's Locket abandoned their posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks. It would be a real headache for us if they became bandits and started wreaking havoc in the towns.
7541,"Soldier: I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those Fódlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little intervention, they've changed their tune and are back on our side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line."
7542,"Hubert: We are about to commence the attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin. But first, allow me a moment of your time."
7543,Byleth: What do you need?
7544,"Hubert: It is something I can only ask of you. Listen well... It concerns Lady Edelgard's uncle. The regent of the Empire, Lord Arundel. Although he is currently cooperating with Her Majesty, he maintains his own sizable military troops. It seems to me that his plans differ from our own. I assume you recall a certain group's scheming from five years ago. Solon and Kronya... They both served Lord Arundel."
7545,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why must we cooperate?
Choice 2: He must be dealt with."
7546,Choice 1: Why must we cooperate?
7547,Choice 2: He must be dealt with.
7548,"Hubert: Professor, I understand how you must be feeling, considering what they did to your father. I know it must be foul to even consider cooperating with their kind. However, their power is essential for us at present. Edelgard also strongly opposed the idea at first. Our enemy is the Church of Seiros itself. It cannot be toppled with the Empire's might alone. Those working under Lord Arundel are extremely hostile toward the church. And the enemy of our enemy is... Well, I think you sufficiently understand by now."
7549,Byleth: Are you sure that's a good idea?
7550,"Hubert: Until all of Fódlan is united, it is a necessary evil. As for how we deal with them afterward...time will tell. Regardless, Her Majesty and I wish to join our power with yours. You should know that in her heart, Her Majesty regards that group as enemies of herself and her family. They used her father, the former emperor, as a puppet and murdered her siblings with their vile experimentation. I believe Her Majesty may have told you some of this herself. That is why this was a...very painful decision for her to make. I will do all I can to ensure her suffering is not in vain, and I hope I can count on you to do the same. As for all I have told you, please keep it in mind as we march forward. More importantly, I implore you to fight as best you can for Edelgard... From the bottom of my heart, I beg this of you."

7556,"Edelgard: We'll be capturing the Great Bridge of Myrddin, a key strategic location of the Leicester Alliance. Claude will surely be sending reinforcements, so we must prevail before they arrive."
7557,"Hubert: Our opponent is Judith, the so-called Hero of Daphnel. We can handle her. So long as we don't get careless."
7558,"Judith: The boy said to run if I was in danger, but... I could never do that. I'll hold out until reinforcements arrive!"
7559,Leonie: Judith! I'm so glad you're safe! Claude sent me here with reinforcements! (If Leonie was not recruited)
7560,"Alliance General: Sorry to keep you waiting, Judith! We're the reinforcements! (If Leonie was recruited)"
7561,Acheron: Why do I have to put up with orders from that false leader...
7562,"Leonie: Because you're from the smallest noble house in all the Alliance, you whiner! (If Leonie was not recruited)"
7563,Edelgard: Enemy reinforcements... We didn't finish in time. Don't let them secure the ballista!
7564,Ignatz: I am helping Claude build the future of Fódlan!
7565,"Ignatz: We can't place the future of Fódlan in Edelgard's hands. If you're allied with the Empire, I have no choice but to fight you."
7566,"Raphael: Outta my way, Ignatz! I don't wanna have to fight you!"
7567,"Ignatz: Stop deluding yourself. You joined the Empire. Didn't you consider the consequences? I don't want to fight you either, Raphael! But this is war."
7568,Raphael: Ignatz...
7569,Ignatz: Ungh... I should have known this would happen...
7570,Judith: Ignatz! Damn it... Such a good kid. He died too young...
7571,"Leonie: Doesn't matter who you are. I won't hold back, and I won't fall to the Empire!"
7572,Leonie: You're all Captain Jeralt's enemies! And I will avenge him here!
7573,"Leonie: Professor! You know Captain Jeralt's killer was connected to the Empire! Why did you side with them?! Answer me, traitor!"
7574,"Leonie: Judith, I'm sorry... I leave the rest to you..."
7575,Judith: Leonie! You had such a full life ahead of you... I wish I could take your place...
7576,"Judith: This is it... Claude, I'm sorry. I couldn't defend the bridge. All who are able, retreat!"
7577,"Edelgard: Don't let her escape! If we take her out now, the Daphnel territory will be ours! That will allow us to march safely through the Alliance."
7578,"Judith: Avoided death yet again, huh? I'll join Claude and prepare for a counter attack!"
7579,Hubert: Judith's escape will widen the battlefront. Our strategy's failed...
7580,"Balthus: You may not remember me, but trust me. I don't feel great about fighting you. I love a good brawl, but fighting a pretty gal to the death is madness. War is so senseless..."
7581,"Judith: Guh, it looks like I'm done for. Claude... I'm sorry..."
7582,Leonie: Judith! No! (if not defeated and not recruited)
7583,Lorenz: Acheron! What a pleasant surprise! I was concerned I might have to kill someone decent.
7584,Acheron: Ha! House Gloucester is already finished. I've already taken control of your land!
7585,"Lorenz: That's quite enough of your spinning, Weathervane. Time for you to die."
7586,Acheron: There's no reason I should die in this place. It's time for me to return home.
7587,"Edelgard: Alliance soldiers, Judith has fallen! Further conflict is futile! If you surrender, your lives will be spared. Lay down your weapons immediately."
7588,"Edelgard: You have all fought well. With this victory, we now have a foothold in the Alliance. The Imperial Army will cross the Airmid River and push the front lines forward. The fight will continue, but do not allow that to stop you from taking pride in our hard-won victory."
7589,"Ferdinand: Ah, this should put a stop to one of Edelgard's choice phrases. Well done, Professor. I believe it was ""if only the professor were here, we could forge ahead and change the tides of this war."""
7590,Edelgard: Ferdinand. It is not necessary to tell the professor such things.
7591,Caspar: We're not the only ones benefiting! The whole Imperial Army is stronger now!
7592,"Linhardt: Yes, it seems the Empire finally has both of its legs to stand on. Don't you agree?"
7593,Edelgard: You make it sound as though I can't run the Empire on my own. Perhaps it's more apt to say that the pegasus has recovered its horn.
7594,"Dorothea: Judith of Daphnel... What a magnificent warrior. I'm happy to have the professor back just like old times, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this cruel exchange of lives..."
7595,"Petra: When there is something you must not be conceding, you must keep fighting! The fighting has been continuing for five years, but now I am again witnessing the professor's power."
7596,"Bernadetta: I hate fighting! But...with the professor here...maybe it's slightly less terrible? Oh, but everyone is working so hard! Stop it, Bernie, you can't be the only one complaining!"
7597,Hubert: I'm glad to see everyone so inspired. It seems the reappearance of the professor has done much to raise your morale.
7598,"Edelgard: Do you not feel the same, Hubert? Come now, be honest with yourself. Now, we must take advantage of the situation and blaze ahead. Our path is still a long one."

"
7651,"North of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Imperial Army passes through the allied territory of House Gloucester and invades the land of House Riegan, which leads the opposition. They move to attack Claude in the capital, Derdriu, where the leader of the Alliance awaits their arrival.
"
7652,"Enemies are meeting Alliance reinforcements in front of the gates that lead to Derdriu. Defeat the enemies in front of the gates to stall the reinforcements!
"
7653,"Edelgard: Professor, what is your opinion of Claude? I can't help but wonder what sort of impression he made on you."
7654,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He's a schemer.
Edelgard: That is inarguable. And his schemes are still going strong. With them, he's managed to keep the Leicester Alliance from the Empire's grasp.
Choice 2: He's a jokester.
Edelgard: That much is obvious. He acts like a fool, but still manages to make the impossible happen. That's as true now as ever. He's managed to protect the Leicester Alliance with his cunning alone.
Choice 3: He would be a good king.
Edelgard: Interesting... I've never thought of him like that. However, I know you have a keen eye for potential. After all, as leader of the Leicester Alliance, he has managed to protect his entire territory all this time."
7655,"Choice 1: He's a schemer.

7660,"Edelgard: Interesting... I've never thought of him like that. However, I know you have a keen eye for potential. After all, as leader of the Leicester Alliance, he has managed to protect his entire territory all this time."
7661,Byleth: How has he done that?
7662,"Edelgard: Since the beginning, territories within the Alliance have been split between those who support the Empire and those who oppose it. Claude has been acting as an intermediary between the two, essentially keeping the Alliance pacified. As both sides are of equal strength, he's created a situation in which they've all agreed to avoid fighting each other and causing undue bloodshed. By carrying on as though the Alliance is united, he's minimized the Empire's influence there."
7663,"Hubert: Heh. It's quite impressive how well his bold scheme has worked out. However, he is walking on thin ice. One wrong move and the Alliance will shatter. (to Edelgard) Speaking of Claude... Your Majesty, we should not delay in our invasion of the Alliance. It would seem that Claude has some fresh scheme up his sleeve, to no one's surprise."
7664,Edelgard: Is that so?
7665,"Hubert: Yes. The people of Derdriu have suddenly found it difficult to leave or enter the city. We can safely assume he is preparing for battle, but I am certain his plans extend beyond that as well. Do you not think we should take Derdriu at once?"
7666,"Edelgard: Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... A city floating on the ocean certainly poses a challenge. Since it's deep within Riegan territory, we haven't had the opportunity to attack it directly. However, now that we have control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, our situation has changed drastically. They can no longer expand their supply line into the Empire, and so we can finally attack Riegan territory."
7667,"Hubert: House Riegan is not only Claude's house, but also the flagship of those who oppose the Empire within the Alliance. If House Riegan falls, the other Alliance lords will be tripping over themselves to join us. That is why we cannot fail to take Derdriu."
7668,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's go.
Hubert: Confidence is one thing, Professor, but see to it that you do not underestimate Claude.
Choice 2: That seems difficult.
Hubert: Fair enough. Claude will certainly be a difficult opponent."
7669,"Choice 1: Let's go.
Hubert: Confidence is one thing, Professor, but see to it that you do not underestimate Claude."
7670,"Hubert: Confidence is one thing, Professor, but see to it that you do not underestimate Claude."
7671,"Choice 2: That seems difficult.
Hubert: Fair enough. Claude will certainly be a difficult opponent."
7672,Hubert: Fair enough. Claude will certainly be a difficult opponent.
7673,Hubert: The leader of the Alliance has had many things said about him... They say he is unbeatable in a battle of intellect. I hear they call him the Master Tactician.
7674,"Edelgard: I wish we could settle all of this before the fighting begins. Don't you? I wish it dearly. But few others feel that way. They fight in a bloody battle, take countless lives, and then finally come to understand defeat. They refuse to admit when they're beaten, and they keep it up until they've been utterly defeated. Of course, I understand that sacrifice is inevitable... But if they're going to surrender after being defeated anyway, why raise a weapon in the first place?"
7675,"Hubert: So, we've somehow managed to take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. That means House Gloucester should now be ready to join the fold more formally. We've blown a major hole in Claude's plans to preserve the Alliance. We should press on to Derdriu before he has the opportunity to adjust his strategy."
7676,"Ferdinand: I have been wondering something... If I had not been your student, where would I be right now? Who would I be? Do you ever think that sort of thing, Professor?"
7677,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Like what if I had led a different class?
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.

Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to go back and try a different path.

7684,"Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. It's all a great deal of a bother, but I will do my part of course."
7685,"Caspar: Didn't they used to call Claude the ""Master Tactician""? I want a nickname too! Maybe I'll get one if I can defeat him at Derdriu... I'll come up with a plan that'll beat his and earn me a nickname for sure!"
7686,"Bernadetta: Claude... Claude... Which was he again? Oh! Right. Yeah, of course I remember him. It's just... I can't picture his face. Don't remember what he looks like. I'm not sure if I ever knew. Oh well. He's just another enemy now, isn't he? What, am I not supposed to say that?!"
7687,"Dorothea: I'm happy when we win battles, and I'm always relieved when our friends make it back safe. On the other hand, it's hard to watch the enemy die. Even worse when it's someone you know. Perhaps it would have been better if I'd just stayed with the opera..."
7688,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't think so. (Relationship with Dorothea up)

Lorenz: Not at all. On the contrary, I look forward to it. My old rival will be a worthy test for me.
Choice 2: Will he put up a hard fight? (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: I certainly hope so. I would be quite disappointed if my greatest rival were to simply roll over."

7722,Lorenz: I certainly hope so. I would be quite disappointed if my greatest rival were to simply roll over.
7723,"Lorenz: I know Claude better than anyone. He is a schemer. No doubt he has some trap for us in mind. Let us be vigilant, Professor."
7724,"Raphael: We're gonna go up against Claude next? I haven't seen him in forever. Wonder how he's been... I chose this side because I believe in you, Professor. But it's not like I got anything against Claude."
7725,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What was he like?
Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!
Choice 2: Were you close? (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone."
7726,"Choice 1: What was he like?
Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!"
7727,"Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!"

Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone."
7729,Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone.
7730,"Raphael: I don't mind so much that we gotta fight him, I just hope he doesn't get killed..."
7731,"Ignatz: I thought I was ready for this, but it's not easy to fight against my old schoolmates... I was in the Golden Deer House, so I have a lot of memories with them."
7732,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you feeling conflicted? (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: No, I'm not. I decided to fight alongside you, and I will not waver.
Choice 2: It's hard for me too.
Ignatz: Really, it is? I wish that we could resolve this without violence."
7733,"Choice 1: Are you feeling conflicted? (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: No, I'm not. I decided to fight alongside you, and I will not waver."
7734,"Ignatz: No, I'm not. I decided to fight alongside you, and I will not waver."

Ignatz: Really, it is? I wish that we could resolve this without violence."
7736,"Ignatz: Really, it is? I wish that we could resolve this without violence."
7737,"Ignatz: Then again, precisely because they're old friends, I wouldn't leave this to someone else. I have to assume responsibility."
7738,"Lysithea: Without the support of the pro-Imperialist lords, the Alliance is greatly weakened. Even so, I don't feel great about all this. We're gonna be fighting Claude..."
7739,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We must not let our guard down. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: We can't--you're right. Claude has such unusual strategies for toying with his enemies.
Choice 2: We can definitely win.
Lysithea: Even so, we should stay alert. Claude won't be caught off guard. Neither should we."
7740,"Choice 1: We must not let our guard down. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: We can't--you're right. Claude has such unusual strategies for toying with his enemies."

7743,"Lysithea: Even so, we should stay alert. Claude won't be caught off guard. Neither should we."
7744,"Lysithea: Even with you here, this battle will be very challenging."
7745,"Marianne: The tide of war is clearly favoring us, but Claude refuses to surrender. I wonder why that could be..."
7746,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's against his principles.
Marianne: Frankly, it seems to me that his ideals are not that far removed from Edelgard's...
Choice 2: The way he sees it, we can't both exist. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: I think you're probably right..."
7747,"Choice 1: It's against his principles.
Marianne: Frankly, it seems to me that his ideals are not that far removed from Edelgard's..."

Marianne: I think you're probably right..."
7750,Marianne: I think you're probably right...
7751,Marianne: I suppose even the very powerful can be irrational at times...
7752,"Leonie: I'm from Alliance lands, but I'm only a commoner. The idea of fighting Alliance nobles isn't exactly losing me any sleep. Fighting old friends though? That's something else. Ugh. I'd better clear my head. Captain Jeralt used to say a mercenary has to be thoughtless. Guess I finally get what he meant."
7753,Alois: Do you ever regret taking the path you did?
7754,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes.
Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.
Choice 2: No. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: Hah, the very model of a leader! I should take a page out of your book.
Choice 3: All the time.
Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human."
7755,"Choice 1: Yes.
Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human."
7756,Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.

Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human."
7760,Alois: Hm. I guess doubts and regrets just come with being human.
7761,"Alois: Whatever path you choose going forward, I'll follow you without question."
7762,"Shamir: Claude, eh? He always was sharp among his peers. Never let himself get caught up in conventions. He wasn't typical in Fódlan. Then there's Rhea and King Dimitri... I'd stay on their good sides, for different reasons."
7763,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You don't have a choice.
Choice 2: I have no desire to kill them, but... (Relationship with Shamir up)"
7764,Choice 1: You don't have a choice.
7765,"Choice 2: I have no desire to kill them, but... (Relationship with Shamir up)"
7766,"Shamir: Yeah, well... If that's the only way forward, it can't be helped."
7767,"Hanneman: Professor, I think you should be made aware of a certain group working with the Imperial army. They are the same lot that invented a technique to turn monsters into war assets. It's quite obvious their trick draws on the power of the Crest Stones, but... There is something more to it than that. Some secret I have yet to decipher. I suppose I need to better understand what kind of people they are. Who are they? What do they want? For her part, Miss Edelgard is cooperating, yet does not hide her hostility towards them. I suspect we should prepare in case the day should come when we must combat these strange people."
7768,"Manuela: Remember the Death Knight who stabbed me five years ago? Of course you do. How could you forget? Well, it turns out he's a general in the Imperial army! He leads the western front against the Kingdom. Once I knew he was at Garreg Mach, I stormed right up to him, told him who I was, and what he did... And he offered me an apology. I'm talking about a sincere, heartfelt, solemn apology. What a letdown. What's going on with that guy, anyway? Who is he under that mask?"
7769,"Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?"
7770,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes.
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Choice 2: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
7771,"Choice 1: Yes.
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."
7772,"Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."

7774,"Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
7775,"Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor."
7776,Jeritza: What is it?
7777,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I just want to chat a bit.
Jeritza: I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to. Although you may not be.
Choice 2: Nothing.
Jeritza Leave, then. I feel a nearly uncontrollable urge to destroy you."
7778,"Choice 1: I just want to chat a bit.
Jeritza: I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to. Although you may not be."
7779,"Jeritza: I have no words for you. I have blades, and if you wish to cross them, I'll be more than happy to. Although you may not be."
7780,"Choice 2: Nothing.
Jeritza Leave, then. I feel a nearly uncontrollable urge to destroy you."
7781,"Jeritza Leave, then. I feel a nearly uncontrollable urge to destroy you."
7782,"Jeritza I was told not to, however, so I will hold off. Until the war ends."
7783,"Balthus: So, Goneril's troops have entered Derdriu. Hm... Oh. Hey, pal. Didn't see you there. Guess I was lost in thought."
7784,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What happened?
Choice 2: Goneril... Is this about Hilda? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a quick one, Professor."
7785,Choice 1: What happened?
7786,"Choice 2: Goneril... Is this about Hilda? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a quick one, Professor."
7787,"Balthus: You're a quick one, Professor."
7788,"Balthus: I caught wind that Duke Goneril sent Hilda to Derdriu. She's the sister of my buddy, Holst. I can't let her die. I won't! Gah, this is a terrible situation..."
7789,"Randolph: Lately, the Kingdom and the Knights of Seiros haven't made any significant moves. I don't suppose they're going to stand by and watch while we attack Derdriu though. That's why I've doubled our guard and instructed them to be extra vigilant. I will keep Garreg Mach safe! It is my duty and responsibility."
7790,"Fleche: Big brother always gets me so fired up... Better keep an eye on him. Oh, sorry! I was just talking to myself. I hear you're heading out to Derdriu. Good luck with the battle!"
7791,"Ladislava: Five years ago, during the attack on this place, you allowed me to join your side. Since then I've risen through the ranks, and now I'm a general leading my own army. In this invasion of the Alliance, I've been entrusted with maintaining the supply lines and keeping the Goneril territories under control. That's why I won't be accompanying to Derdriu. Please look after Lady Edelgard."
7792,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Derdriu is known as the Aquatic capital... It's a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor. In times of peace, it would be a wonderful place for a holiday... Anyway! Best of luck in the next battle!"
7793,"Imperial Soldier: To tell you the truth, I used to be a Knight of Seiros. But at some point, I just couldn't follow the archbishop anymore. I ran away in secret...and decided to join the Imperial army. When I found Alois here, it made me feel much better. It meant I'd made the right decision. Ever since the day you disappeared, the archbishop has been completely different. She started laughing as if she was possessed and spouting complete gibberish..."
7794,"Soldier: The Alliance troops were nothing to turn a nose up at. They were pretty strong and brave too. Our next target of attack is Derdriu, the Alliance base. Better stay sharp, even if we do have superior numbers."
7795,"Soldier: If you travel east from the Alliance and cross Fódlan's Throat, you enter the land of Almyra. House Goneril's territory touches the eastern border of the Alliance. They also have Lord Holst, the most valiant warrior of the Alliance. Tasked with keeping watch over the Almyrans' movements, he rarely leaves Goneril territory."
7796,"Soldier: The Gloucester and Ordelia houses have territory in the southern regions of the Alliance. Everyone knows they support the Empire, so they won't get in the way of our armies."
7797,"Soldier: Five years ago, most of the people involved with the church in the Empire moved to the Eastern Church in Alliance territory. I've been hearing rumors that the majority of those have now gone to the Kingdom Capital, Fhirdiad. The Eastern Church has no military force of its own, so they must be sensing the Alliance is weak and fleeing."
7798,"Citizen: A hungry hero is no better than a well-fed soldier. Do you know that saying? No? That's because I just made it up. If you're hungry, you're never going to be at full strength. Keep your belly full and stay strong!"
7799,"Artisan: We can't actually join you on the battlefield, but rest assured that we're there in spirit. We're doing everything we can to support the army, so give it your all out there!"
7800,"Scholar: In order to defeat a formidable foe, you must first learn who they are. How much do you know about the Alliance? The Leicester Alliance unites the feudal lords of that region. It holds regular roundtable conferences, where they vote on their policies. However, only the Five Great Lords are permitted to vote... Duke Goneril, Count Gloucester, Count Ordelia, Margrave Edmund, and their leader, Duke Riegan. Their titles were originally granted to them by the royal family of Faerghus. About 300 years ago, the Alliance was still part of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, you see."
7801,Yuri: Ugh! What more could Hubert possible want from me?
7802,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What did he do? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: He's been pushing me too damn hard. Said that the only way to win over the Alliance lords is with my help.
Choice 2: You seem tired...
Yuri: Well, yeah, clearly. I haven't been worked this hard in ages..."
7803,"Choice 1: What did he do? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: He's been pushing me too damn hard. Said that the only way to win over the Alliance lords is with my help."
7804,Yuri: He's been pushing me too damn hard. Said that the only way to win over the Alliance lords is with my help.
7805,"Choice 2: You seem tired...
Yuri: Well, yeah, clearly. I haven't been worked this hard in ages..."
7806,"Yuri: Well, yeah, clearly. I haven't been worked this hard in ages..."
7807,"Yuri: All grousing aside, it's not the end of the world. If it helps us win, I'll do whatever it takes. I wouldn't have signed up for this if I wasn't getting something out of it."
7808,"Constance: Ahaha! The Great Bridge of Myrddin is ours. The Alliance may be composed of powerful nobles, but their power is directionless and thus wasted. Though the Empire was no better before Lady Edelgard ascended the throne. Indeed, my own house fell due in part to its inability to wield power properly..."
7809,"Hapi: You know, I've always wanted to see the world. That's why I left my village. And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind. Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery. Though people might get mad I'm not taking this silly war seriously... Oops, that was close. Almost sighed."
7810,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear Derdriu is our next objective. Small world. That's actually where I grew up. It's a great place..."
7811,Rogue: I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter down here—nowhere else to go. Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their strongest people to this fight.
7812,"Resident: Hello, Professor. I doubt you recognize me, but I work for Lord Hubert. He has stationed me here to ensure that the church does not attempt to make use of this place. Thus, I'm blending in with the residents here. Strictly confidentially, of course."
7813,"Resident: The army runs you ragged. Marches you from place to place, prodding you to fight. They promised me three meals a day... They'd have to give a lot more than that to get me to sign on. I'd rather starve down here than deal with that."
7814,"Hubert: If it is not too much trouble, please find the most beautiful flowers you can. We require a large amount of them, so do not be too selective about their size."
7815,Hubert: Lady Edelgard adorns the graves of the fallen with flowers after each and every battle. Thank you for ensuring that she does not have to do so alone.
7816,Hubert: Would you assist us in securing more resources?
7817,"Hubert: Thank you for helping to gather resources. Please accept this simple gift, by way of compensation."
7818,"Soldier: The fish seem skittish lately... It's said that every five years, in the wake of a storm, a mystery fish appears and eats up all of the other fish in the pond. They call it the Big One. I thought that was just a legend, though."
7819,"Soldier: You got rid of the Big One! Now the other fish can rest easy. Assuming fish rest... Anyway, nice work."
7820,"Merchant: I want to start a collection that chronicles the history of Fódlan, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on anything significant. Honestly, it might be easier to excavate an artifact rather than trying to find one for sale..."
7821,"Merchant: Ah, magnificent! Exactly what I was looking for. Clearly I asked the right person for help."
7822,"Soldier: Recently, pirates have been raiding coastal towns in the Sreng Region. People say that they're attacking innocent civilians and sinking merchant ships. Think you can do something about that?"
7823,Soldier: Nice work out there! Some mercenaries heard news of your valiant leadership and have come to the monastery to offer their services.
7824,Soldier: Some soldiers stationed at Fódlan's Locket abandoned their posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks. It would be a real headache for us if they became bandits and started wreaking havoc in the towns.
7825,"Soldier: I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those Fódlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little intervention, they've changed their tune and are back on our side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line."
7826,Jeritza: Secret orders from the emperor. You and I are to launch a surprise attack on the enemy base in the eastern part of Fódlan. Come.
7827,Jeritza: I am not interested in who our opponent is. This was nothing more than a chance to quench my thirst...
7828,Balthus: It seems some villages out near Fódlan's Throat have been having some trouble with thieves lately. Holst asked for help dealing with the problem. You mind coming along?
7829,"Balthus: Sorry for dragging you along on that, pal. But hey, would you like to meet Holst sometime? I think he's really interested in you. Maybe we all can meet up the next time we're in his neck of the woods?"
7830,Edelgard: It's almost time to depart. Are you ready?
7831,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Leave it to me.
Edelgard: A promising answer. Whatever happens, never allow your foe to see any weakness.
Choice 2: I don't think we can win.
Edelgard: I agree that Claude will prove a difficult foe. Still, do not speak such words right before a battle."
7832,"Choice 1: Leave it to me.
Edelgard: A promising answer. Whatever happens, never allow your foe to see any weakness."
7833,"Edelgard: A promising answer. Whatever happens, never allow your foe to see any weakness."
7834,"Choice 2: I don't think we can win.
Edelgard: I agree that Claude will prove a difficult foe. Still, do not speak such words right before a battle."
7835,"Edelgard: I agree that Claude will prove a difficult foe. Still, do not speak such words right before a battle."
7836,Edelgard: We must pay attention not only to Claude's schemes but to the man himself. He's a master archer who wields the legendary bow Failnaught. He won't fall easily.
7837,Byleth: Failnaught...
7838,Edelgard: It's the Relic of House Riegan. That bow once belonged to one of the [[Ten Elites|10 Elites. Professor... Do you know the true story behind the legend? The Relics were created by the hands of mankind. Seiros collected them after killing the 10 Elites. Seiros manipulated the people of the world and defeated the all-powerful King Nemesis.
7839,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I thought he was corrupted by his power?
Edelgard: That's the history the Church of Seiros maintains. However, it was little more than a simple dispute.
Choice 2: Why would she do that?
Edelgard: The church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil. However, it was little more than a simple dispute."
7840,"Choice 1: I thought he was corrupted by his power?
Edelgard: That's the history the Church of Seiros maintains. However, it was little more than a simple dispute."
7841,"Edelgard: That's the history the Church of Seiros maintains. However, it was little more than a simple dispute."
7842,"Choice 2: Why would she do that?
Edelgard: The church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil. However, it was little more than a simple dispute."
7843,"Edelgard: The church maintains the false history that he was corrupted and turned evil. However, it was little more than a simple dispute."
7844,"Edelgard: Should the one leading the people of the world be someone with humanity or a creature that can merely masquerade as a human at will? In the end, Seiros was victorious. The Immaculate One and her family then took control of Fódlan. I know this because that knowledge is passed down from emperor to emperor. And that is the because the first emperor is the human who cooperated with Seiros, allowing humanity to be controlled in secret."
7845,Byleth: ...
7846,"Edelgard: Perhaps it's fate that you can wield the Sword of the Creator, just like Nemesis, the King of Liberation. And that very fate will lead you to use that sword to stand against those who would distort history."
7847,"Claude: It seems they've set out from Garreg Mach... That's sooner than expected. Losing the Great Bridge of Myrddin was a serious blow. So is the fact that Teach is still alive. On top of all that...Judith. I told her to run if things looked grim. Damn it. So many people will die, and by my call."
7848,Nader: And what of it? Would you rather turn tail and run back home?
7849,Claude: Nader... You're really getting on my nerves. Do you have any idea how much of the Alliance adores me and believes in me?
7850,"Nader: Well, I suppose it's quite a lot. Does that mean that..."
7851,"Claude: Yes. The plan is a go. I'm counting on you, Nader. We'll make a good show taking down those who would assault Derdriu."
7852,"Nader: People say our kind may not always win, but we never lose. Let's teach them the real meaning of those words."
7853,"Claude: Now then... Let's see what you're made of, Teach..."
7854,Suggested Level: 29
7855,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
7856,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle."
7857,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
7858,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle.
7859,"Claude: Here she comes, at long last... I've done all I can to prepare. Let the cards fall where they may. It'll be a true test of strength."
7860,Edelgard: It seems Claude has blockaded the city and occupied the naval port.
7861,"Hubert: Heh. If that is the case, he will have no choice but to engage us from there."
7862,"Edelgard: Yes. Though putting myself in Claude's place leaves me with an unpleasant feeling... If we take over the port and close the entry to the city, Derdriu will be under our control. Each soldier should bear that in mind as they advance."
7863,Hubert: There are three gates which connect Derdriu to its naval port. Taking the city will be easy once we secure all three.
7864,"Claude: Now it's our turn, Almyra's elite! Strike the flanks of the Imperial army!"
7865,Claude: Those fangs and claws the Alliance fears so much will now be their salvation!
7866,"Nader: Leave it to us, kiddo! My undefeated streak will live on. Another chapter in my heroic saga!"
7867,"Edelgard: That flag and banner... Is that the Almyran army? Ugh, you really did it, Claude!"
7868,"Hubert: This is no ruse. That is Nader, an Almyran general."
7869,Edelgard: Take care of them quickly! Especially those Almyran wyverns!
7870,Hubert: The Almyran reinforcements keep coming. We should try to eliminate Nader...
7871,Villager: We don't have the guts to resist anymore! Here...you can have this! Just please don't attack the city!
7872,"Edelgard: I never planned to touch the city. Our target is the Alliance and their leader, Claude."
7873,"Hilda: You didn't forget about me, did you? Maybe you should just let me go."
7874,"Hilda: Professor! It's been too long. But now we're on opposite sides, huh? What a shame. I'm not going to hold back. I can't let down my dear old Claude."
7875,"Marianne: I-I'm so sorry, Hilda. I..."
7876,"Hilda: It's OK, Marianne. These things happen in war."
7877,"Balthus: Back off, Hilda. Holst wouldn't want this."
7878,"Hilda: No, Baltie, you back off. I'm right where I wanna be. If you kill me here, I won't be the one my brother holds responsible."
7879,"Balthus: If that happens, offering my life is the least I can do to make it up to him. That...and bringing you home."
7880,"Hilda: It's been fun, Claude... Sorry to go so soon..."
7881,Claude: Hilda! Why didn't you retreat?! I counted on you retreating...
7882,Lysithea: Don't expect me to go easy on you. Because I won't.
7883,"Lysithea: You are here as well, Professor? That is a shame..."
7884,Edelgard: Lysithea. How unfortunate that a talented woman like you should throw her life away on a pointless battle.
7885,"Lysithea: Ha, do not underestimate me. The fight is far from over, Edelgard!"
7886,"Balthus: Gah, you're here too? You aren't going to make this easy on me, are you, little lady?"
7887,"Lysithea: If you're worried about your debt to my parents, you'll have to contend with them. I can't help you now.
(Alternate): You think you stand a chance against me? However you feel, I won't stand down."
7888,"(Alternate): You think you stand a chance against me? However you feel, I won't stand down."
7889,"Balthus: No way, pal. I won't kill you... Hey, Professor! Persuade this one to join our side later, yeah?"
7890,"Lysithea: That's the last of my energy. If you're gonna kill me, make it quick. Fair warning though, I'll likely come back to haunt you. It's not like I've had an easy time of it, after all...
Persuade: You...want me to join you? The Alliance is over no matter what. The only thing left is to place faith in you and Edelgard. There's still so much I have to accomplish. Thank you for the second chance, Professor.
Kill: Father, Mother... I'm sorry I didn't listen to you..."
7891,"Persuade: You...want me to join you? The Alliance is over no matter what. The only thing left is to place faith in you and Edelgard. There's still so much I have to accomplish. Thank you for the second chance, Professor."
7892,"Kill: Father, Mother... I'm sorry I didn't listen to you..."
7893,Nader: It's been 30-odd years since I set foot on a field of battle. Here's a taste of my undefeated strength!
7894,Nader: The emperor continues fighting at the front line. Is the Empire short on troops?
7895,"Edelgard: Unfortunately, I can't deny it. But then, I've heard the Almyran king does the very same. You have traveled far. I do hope it's for a king who would not only lead his army but fight at their side."
7896,"Nader: Touché... Yes, he is that sort of king!"
7897,"Nader: Sorry, kiddo. It seems we'll have to withdraw..."
7898,"Claude: You've done enough, Nader. Just stay alive. We'll meet again one day!"
7899,Edelgard: We have forced the Almyran forces to flee. I doubt they're expecting more reinforcements.
7900,Claude: Heh... So sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield.
7901,"Claude: Teach... You should have chosen me instead of Edelgard. No point in whining about it now, I suppose. Sorry, but I'll be taking the win today."
7902,"Claude: We haven't seen each other since Garreg Mach. You've grown lovelier than ever, Edelgard."
7903,"Edelgard: You're not so unfortunate yourself. And as usual, you're here at a most inopportune moment."
7904,"Claude: Well, I'm sure we have much more to talk about... But how about we settle things first?"
7905,"Edelgard: No objections here. Prepare yourself, Claude."
7906,"Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up as an Imperial general..."
7907,"Claude: Enough! You've bested me. If I die here, the Alliance becomes part of the Empire."
7908,"Edelgard: Do you yield, then? You've never known when to give up."
7909,"Claude: Well, I can't just surrender so easily. I'm responsible for the others. If you're as smart as you seem, I bet you've figured out why I was able to summon Almyran reinforcements. Wouldn't it be better to let me go and have me in your debt?
Spare: Thank you, Professor. And you, Edelgard. I'm truly grateful for your courageous decision. I will return your kindness one day... I promise. (Claude flies away)
Kill: I see. Right until the very end, I've read this whole thing terribly wrong... All my hopes have fallen to ash... It's all up to you now, Edelgard... I really hope you do make the world...better... (Claude dies)"
7910,"Spare: Thank you, Professor. And you, Edelgard. I'm truly grateful for your courageous decision. I will return your kindness one day... I promise. (Claude flies away)"
7911,"Kill: I see. Right until the very end, I've read this whole thing terribly wrong... All my hopes have fallen to ash... It's all up to you now, Edelgard... I really hope you do make the world...better... (Claude dies)"
7912,Edelgard: Everybody! Raise your voices in a victory cheer! Derdriu is ours!
7913,"Claude: The plan's not working... The fate of the Leicester Alliance, and all my dreams, have fallen to ash... It's all up to you now, Edelgard... I really hope you do make the world...better... (Claude dies)"
7914,Edelgard: Everybody! Raise your voices in a victory cheer! Derdriu is ours!
7915,"Claude: Hey, Teach."
7916,Edelgard: Claude?!
7917,"Claude: Settle down, will you? You're the victor, after all. I could have escaped, but I decided to say hi to Teach. Nothing to worry about. Derdriu has fallen and the Alliance has collapsed. There's nothing I could do to turn things around at this point."
7918,Edelgard: You want me to drop my guard around someone who evaded detection by my soldiers? Impossible. Did you really risk coming here just to say hello?
7919,"Claude: I did. But mostly, I wanted to say good-bye. I'm leaving Fódlan."
7920,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why are you leaving?
Choice 2: Lend us your strength.
Claude: Lend you my... I knew I liked you, Teach!"
7921,Choice 1: Why are you leaving?
7922,"Choice 2: Lend us your strength.
Claude: Lend you my... I knew I liked you, Teach!"
7923,"Claude: Lend you my... I knew I liked you, Teach!"
7924,"Claude: I daresay Fódlan would be a lot more peaceful without me around. Right, Your Majesty?"
7925,"Edelgard: It's as you say. So long as you remain here, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire will continue to support you."
7926,"Claude: Too true. It's best if I leave this place altogether. I'll just have to find some other way to pay back my debt to you. All I ask is that you go easy on the Alliance. After all, no one there would dare defy you. And please, treat my former classmates well. I've asked them to cooperate with you if I lost."
7927,Edelgard: Wait... Did your scheming include a plan for if the Alliance lost?
7928,"Claude: Heh, you think too highly of me. It just seems that way now. Outside of Derdriu, most of the Alliance is unscathed and ready to join your superior strength. In all honesty, I was hoping to become a supreme ruler and lead Fódlan to peace myself. But...that won't be happening now."
7929,Edelgard: Claude...
7930,"Claude: Good luck to you, Edelgard."
7931,Edelgard: We crushed him in battle and yet... He really is difficult to understand.
7932,"Edelgard: Derdriu is ours. The Alliance has collapsed, and their leader has fallen."
7933,Byleth: Did we really have to kill him?
7934,"Edelgard: If Claude had lived, the faction of the Alliance that is against the Empire would have never stopped fighting us. To keep the bloodshed to a minimum, he had to be taken out of the equation. However, now that it's over, I can't help but wonder if he was in complete control of that entire situation. What will become of the Alliance without him... He must have taken that into account. Without the rule of House Riegan, and with most of the territory left unscathed, the Alliance will undoubtedly ally itself with the Empire. The citizen's lives will be saved from ruin, and no more blood will be shed. Perhaps that's what he wanted from the start..."
7935,Byleth: That sounds like Claude.
7936,"Edelgard: Of course, if his plan here in Derdriu had worked and I had lost my life...the opposite would have come to pass. The Empire would have rushed to the Alliance without further conflict. No matter how the battle unfolded, Claude secured the shortest, most peaceful possible outcome."
7937,"Hubert: Lady Edelgard, Derdriu is now completely under our control. As planned, the Alliance's affairs will now be overseen by Count Bergliez."
7938,"Caspar: My father is coming here? First west, than east... You sure keep him busy."
7939,Hubert: Should the others return to the monastery and prepare to face the Kingdom?
7940,"Edelgard: Yes. Thank you, Hubert. Thanks to all of your efforts, our battle with the Alliance has reached its conclusion. However, we still can't afford to be careless. We must now join the battle against the Kingdom. With the strength of the church on their side, they will prove to be a formidable enemy. More than ever, your support is invaluable. We'll need it in the days to come. But for now, let's enjoy our triumphant return!"
7941,Caspar: Let's get to it!
7942,Dorothea: I'm so happy that the end of the fighting is near. Too bad there's still more violence to come...
7943,Petra: The Kingdom and the Church of Seiros are worthy for fighting. I will crush them into very small pieces!
7944,"Linhardt: Crushing wouldn't yield a lot of pieces, but I guess it would get the job done. With the Professor we can't lose...probably."
7945,"Bernadetta: Oh no, are we fighting Lady Rhea? But she's scary! And she'll be really angry! But no way she can stay in her spooky beast form all the time...right?"
7946,"Dorothea: If she could, she would have come and attacked the monastery as many times as she wanted."
7947,"Ferdinand: It may be wishful thinking, but perhaps it is a power that she can only access when the situation is dire. But whether she is the archbishop or the Immaculate One, we cannot be stopped! Half remains, but half is finished... We are certainly moving forward."
7948,Hubert: No one can stop us from pushing forward. No one.

8011,Hubert: We must be careful not to expose any weakness.
8012,Edelgard: Of course. Though it seems we can now attack the Kingdom without issue.
8013,"Hubert: True. However, you should know that Lord Arundel has entered Derdriu. It would seem he has already started collecting the Relics of the old Alliance..."
8014,Edelgard: Let him do as he pleases for now. It's not yet the time to chide him.
8015,"Hubert: Understood. As for the Kingdom... As we theorized, it is not entirely united. If we defeat the royal family of House Blaiddyd and a handful of other notable houses, it should fall under our control quite readily. Those we must target include the houses Fraldarius, Galatea, Gautier, and Charon."
8016,"(If Felix, Sylvain or Ingrid has been recruited)
Hubert: We have allies who are close to some of those lords. Perhaps that can be used to our advantage. Persuasion by tears or threats...Perhaps one would consent to act as an hostage? We must make good use of the tools given to us."

8018,"Edelgard: What about House Rowe in Arianrhod, the Fortress City? Will they not side with us?"
8019,"Hubert: The head of House Fraldarius, Lord Rodrigue, has entered the city. It is possible that he has seized it."
8020,Edelgard: I see. Then it might prove too difficult to strike Fhirdiad right away.
8021,"Hubert: Either way, when preparations are complete, we can begin our deployment into the Kingdom."
8022,Edelgard: That part of the plan remains unchanged. Professor? Is something wrong?
8023,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No, it's nothing.
Choice 2: Many of those names are new to me.

8047,Byleth: ...

8054,"Hubert: Claude von Riegan. What an interesting character. Underneath that compassionate exterior, he was always cold and calculating. Ordinary fools run headlong into combat, without even considering the possibility of defeat. But to consider one's chances, and to prepare for plans to go awry--that takes real intelligence. I have to say, I am impressed beyond words."
8055,"Ferdinand: The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the Alliance nobles' decision. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worst of it. We will not see such a peaceful resolution in Faerghus, I am afraid, as it is ruled by the royal family, not a council of nobles."
8056,"Linhardt: I've been exploring the Holy Mausoleum. It's quite interesting in there. There is a mechanism I believe would allow us passage into the Holy Tomb, but I'm unclear on how to activate it. My research hasn't turned up much. It may come down to asking the archbishop for details."

8157,"Randolph: Finally, the Kingdom... After that, we'll battle the church. I volunteered for monastery guard duty. It was more for my family than anything. But now, from the bottom of my heart, I want to see Her Majesty ruling this land. Even if it costs me my life, I will protect Garreg Mach!"
8158,"Fleche: I just wanted to help out my brother, Randolph, so I aspired to be a soldier. My brother puts his life on the line to fight, so I'll put everything I have into it too. Eventually the enemy will attack, and when they do, we'll defend this place to the bitter end!"

8160,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You may already know this, but the Kingdom and the Alliance were once a single entity. The leaders of the Alliance, House Riegan, are actually a branch of the Blaiddyd royal family. In a way, it's just a battle of the part of Blaiddyd family tree that rose in rebellion against the Empire..."
8161,"Soldier: They call Lord Rodrigue, who's defending Arianrhod, the Shield of Faerghus. He used to be on friendly terms with Dimitri's father, the former king. There's no chance that he'll surrender to us."
8162,Soldier: It goes without saying but Garreg Mach is the most important sacred place to the Church of Seiros. The Knights of Seiros will try to get this place back by any means necessary. I don't think they're going to stay in the Kingdom capital forever. We should stay vigilant.
8163,Soldier: King Dimitri of Faerghus possesses superhuman strength... I heard he can lift a horse with a single hand! I wonder if it's true...
8164,Soldier: The main body of the Imperial army is moving to the western region of the former Alliance territory to attack the kingdom. The time when victory or defeat will be decided between us and the Kingdom is close at hand.
8165,"Citizen: Randolph has a big appetite. It does a heart good to see him. And he's handsome, too. Compared to him, Hubert is... Heh, forget I said anything."
8166,"Citizen: General Ladislava is really popular among the citizens of the Empire. If I remember correctly, the emperor herself has recognized her genius and made her a general. Despite her considerable talent, she never puts on airs. And she's beautiful too. She's even known as the Scarlet Warrior."
8167,"Merchant: Doesn't seem to be much unrest in the former Alliance territories, perhaps thanks to Count Bergliez' strength. That said, General Randolph is the head of one of the branches of House Bergliez. It was once difficult for someone from a branch family to get ahead in life. But under His Majesty... Anyone who accomplishes great deeds during the war will see more success than they could have ever imagined!"
8168,"Scholar: You must know this already... The former Faerghus territory used to belong to the Empire. The Battle of Tailtean, where Nemesis was defeated, put Faerghus under the Empire's control. Centuries later, a revolution sprung up in Faerghus, and through the mediation of the church, the Kingdom gained independence. The ringleader of the revolt became the first king, Loog von Blaiddyd. The Blaiddyds, the royal family of Faerghus, are directly descended from Loog, who was also known as the King of Lions. If you look at it from the point of view of the Empire, the Kingdom is just a bunch of traitors."
8169,Yuri: I'm impressed by how quickly toppling Derdriu brought the Alliance into the fold. Ideally we'd crush the Kingdom with ease...but something tells me it'll be...complicated. You'd better sharpen your focus to a fine point. Though I'm sure you already know that.

8204,"Hubert: Heh. The battle looks to be rather cumbersome. We are still guarding all of Garreg Mach, but there are undoubtedly numerous secret passages and magic traps... There is still much about this place that we do not know. It is quite possible that they will attack from a location we cannot anticipate."
8205,Edelgard: I must head out first to give my orders. I'll meet up with you soon. Call for General Randolph and General Ladislava! Hurry!

To think that the vessel of the goddess, entrusted with the Sword of the Creator, could go on to... Ah, it angers me to even think of it! All that has happened has changed Rhea. I imagine it has changed the professor as well. Even if we prevail, I doubt the church can ever fully return to the way it once was..."

8237,"Alois: Why, if it isn't Shamir! You're still with the knights. What a surprise."

8277,Edelgard: Silence. We must tend to your wounds.
8278,Randolph: It will do no good. I can't be saved... You must know that. Ladislava has also passed... The enemy has withdrawn... You are safe now...
8279,"Edelgard: Understood. Good work. Another loss on my watch... As more blood wets my feet, they grow heavier with each step. Remorse, resentment, despair... I have dispensed with all such things to come this far."
8280,Hubert: And we must keep moving forward...
8281,Edelgard: Hubert. Tell me the status of the enemy.
8282,Hubert: The battle has ended in a draw with severe injuries on both sides. Some known commanders have been slain.
8283,(If Seteth was killed)
8284,"Hubert: The most worthy of mention among the dead was the second in command to Rhea herself, Seteth."
8285,"(if Alois was not recruited)
Hubert: With the death of Alois, the Knights of Seiros have taken a huge blow as well."
8286,"Hubert: With the death of Alois, the Knights of Seiros have taken a huge blow as well."
8287,"Hubert: Garreg Mach has not taken much damage, and so it would not be out of line to claim it as a victory for us."
8288,"Edelgard: Yes... We'll call that a victory. Although, I'm sure they will say the same."
8289,"Hubert: Yes, Your Majesty."
8290,"Bernadetta: Ugh, what a terrible opponent that was! Why is the church always like this?! How am I supposed to train for that?! It was way too scary!"
8291,"Linhardt: When I saw the enemy enter Garreg Mach, I prepared myself mentally for death. I thought it would be a fine time to die, but I suppose it wasn't quite the time after all..."
8292,"Petra: Our luck was good to have grabbed victory. The church has great strength. We must not have grief, but must keep fighting. Can we be fighting now?"
8293,"Ferdinand: This was certainly a momentous victory. We lost a lot, but we also gained a lot. Certain lords in the Kingdom have examined the situation again and decided to join our cause. Changing their fealty based on just one battle... They are all a disgrace to the nobility!"
8294,"Dorothea: Today, our enemy held many faces I knew well... If we must fight to the death with that kind of opponent, what will become of this world?"
8295,Caspar: There's no stopping me! I'm ready go strike the Kingdom here and now! Everyone must see that we can easily unite Fódlan! Don't you think?
8296,"Edelgard: Excellent job, everyone. The battle is over now.
Edelgard: Professor, the battle is over now. (If all of the Black Eagle students were defeated in Part 1)"
8297,"Edelgard: Professor, the battle is over now. (If all of the Black Eagle students were defeated in Part 1)"
8298,"Edelgard: While we have sustained heavy losses, our foe has suffered far more."
8299,"Hubert: Although not exactly as planned, a win is a win. It may be safe to say that there will be no more obstacles on our way to the next battle."
8300,"Edelgard: We will break through the Tailtean Plains and then set course for Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. The final chapter of our fight with the Kingdom and the church is close at hand."

"
8307,"I don't see how Dimitri can win.
"
8308,"They're just legends...
"
8309,"Off to the Kingdom capital!

8355,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course.
Hubert: Seems you've already anticipated our intentions, Professor. Well done. Before Fhirdiad, we must take Arianrhod, which lies near the border between the Empire and the Kingdom. As a city on the boundary of the two territories, it must be taken at once.
Choice 2: What's the plan?
Hubert: There is another location we must take before moving on to Fhirdiad. South of the capital, there is a fortress city on the border of the Empire and the Kingdom. It is called Arianrhod, and we must take control of it at once."
8356,"Choice 1: Of course.

8360,"Edelgard: There are many mages within Arianrhod. We will also face Cornelia, a general of the Kingdom. We must also contend with Rodrigue, the head of House Fraldarius, as well as his troops. Once we defeat them, Arianrhod will be ours."
8361,"Hubert: I hear Cornelia has a suspicious magic weapon at her disposal. We must attack before the enemy can respond with defensive measures. That is why we are preparing an assault before even our allies are aware. Even within our ranks, there is no way to know with certainty that there is not a rat among us who would leak such information."
8362,"Edelgard: When Arianrhod falls, we'll focus on striking Fhirdiad from both the south and the east. The deeper we carve our way into Kingdom and church territory, the more favorable our position. As ever, I'm counting on you, my teacher."
8363,Edelgard: Professor? Halt! Don't come in here!
8364,Byleth: Hasn't this happened before?
8365,"Edelgard: Ugh, I thought I told you to forget about that. There's something I don't want you to see."
8366,Byleth: Is it a portrait?
8367,"Edelgard: So...you know about it. Yes, it's a portrait. Of you. I painted it myself. It's, uh...quite disgraceful. I did a terrible job with it, and it looks nothing like you."
8368,"Byleth: Thank you for that, Edelgard."
8369,"Edelgard: I'm happy that you appreciate my efforts, but...please don't touch that door."
8370,"Hubert: This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Mach—if only just. The power of Seteth and Flayn was certainly a sight to behold. The archbishop's supporters were strong. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below..."
8371,"Hubert: This was a trying month, but we did manage to hold Garreg Mach—if only just. Honestly, I did not expect such strident supporters of the archbishop as Seteth and Flayn to flee. But with this victory, we have all but cornered the Church of Seiros and its knights. The goddess above shall give away to the darkness that has long dwelled below..."
8372,"Ferdinand: Dimitri, the King of Faerghus. He despises Edelgard and everything she stands for. I am of the opinion that a man seized by such strong feelings is not fit to be king. It is a sad situation, really."
8373,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Kings are people too.
Ferdinand: If he cannot suppress his emotions to make reasoned decisions, he should abdicate.
Choice 2: Kings can't be emotional? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: No, they cannot. Kingly judgement has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual."

8378,"Ferdinand: At any rate, I find it hard to believe that Dimitri could defeat Edelgard."
8379,"Linhardt: There are stories of Heroes' Relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends... Especially since we know of Relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 Fódlan Elites."
8380,Caspar: All right! Off to the Kingdom's capital we go! What's the matter? Should I not be excited? I can't help it. Everyone's gotta have something to look forward to!
8381,"Bernadetta: I've got a dream, you know. Not that I think it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. I'd like to get out of Fódlan and travel across the sea. Maybe to Dagda. Maybe even past that. I want to see all the wild jungles out there, the huge flowers, and--oh--the carnivorous plants! I know it's not realistic, and I know it's probably impossible, but that's what I'd like."
8382,"Bernadetta: I've got a dream, you know. I don't know if it'll come true, but it's nice to hope. Remember when I went to Brigid, with Petra? I drew a picture of some of the flowers I saw there. Next time, I wanna go even farther. Maybe Dagda. Maybe even past that. I wanna fill a whole book with the drawings of the biggest plants I see! And the carnivorous ones especially! Oh, I hope I get the chance..."
8383,"Dorothea: I heard that Randolph died in battle guarding Garreg Mach. We knew each other for, wow, more than five years... My chest feels tight. Think about it. There's no end in sight to the fighting. I might be next. Any of us could be."

8389,Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
8390,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why's that?
Choice 2: Because it's like hunting? (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey."
8391,Choice 1: Why's that?
8392,"Choice 2: Because it's like hunting? (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey."
8393,Petra: Yes. Hunting is like doing surprise attacks on prey.
8394,Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries. That is a wonderful thing. I have no liking for the thought of losing someone.
8395,"Felix: Since I allied with you and the emperor, my resolve has never wavered. I abandoned my country. I am prepared to kill my father, and kill a man I once called my friend. Resolute as I am, my sword feels...heavy."
8396,"Ashe: In Faerghus, there's an amazing knight of House Rowe they call the Gray Lion. I heard about him from Lonato, who was an acquaintance of his. Apparently he's getting old, but with each year that passes, he only hones his skills even more."
8397,"Sylvain: Some people are so in awe of King Dimitri, they call him the Tempest King. After he wins, there won't be anything left. He'll be a storm, leaving nothing behind. He hates the Empire so much he's willing to do anything to bring it down."
8398,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He hates the Empire?
Sylvain: Yeah, because of the role the Empire played in the Tragedy of Duscur. You know, even back at the Officers Academy, he never had much to do with anyone from the Empire.
Choice 2: He wasn't like that before? (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: No. Then again, maybe we just didn't actually know him at all."
8399,"Choice 1: He hates the Empire?
Sylvain: Yeah, because of the role the Empire played in the Tragedy of Duscur. You know, even back at the Officers Academy, he never had much to do with anyone from the Empire."

8403,Sylvain: We'll be fighting Dimitri and his troops soon. We all oughta train a little harder if we want to stay alive.
8404,"Mercedes: Well, that was certainly frightening."
8405,"Byleth:

Choice 2: The church? (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: You're very perceptive, Professor."
8406,Choice 1: What was?
8407,"Choice 2: The church? (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: You're very perceptive, Professor."
8408,"Mercedes: You're very perceptive, Professor."
8409,"Mercedes: Having to fight against the Church of Seiros was unnerving. To push back against something I've hinged so much of my life upon... I was terrified. But now we must fight Lady Rhea, and I won't back down!"
8410,"Annette: I used to live in the Kingdom capital with my parents. I know we've got no choice but to fight the Kingdom, but I really don't want Fhirdiad to become a battlefield... Lots of my old friends still live in the city, and many people there were kind to me. If fighting breaks out there, all of those people might get caught up in it..."
8411,Ingrid: I never thought this day would come--that I'd fight my homeland. My betrothed was a knight who served the king. He died bravely to protect the future of our country. Now I'm betraying the place he fought to protect. I'm betraying him. But I must do this. Professor. I believe in the path you have chosen for us.
8412,"Lorenz: It seems we will soon set foot in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy."
8413,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Were you a hostage?
Lorenz: No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time.

8417,Lorenz: That's right. I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time.
8418,Lorenz: Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn.
8419,Raphael: Hyah! Next up is the Kingdom's capital! We're coming for you! What's wrong? Was that too much? Maybe it was too dramatic...or I didn't yell it loud enough!
8420,"Ignatz: Soon we'll assault Fhirdiad, the Kingdom's capital! This'll be one for the history books. Our enemy won't hold anything back. I'm quivering with excitement at the very thought of it!"
8421,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Bravo. You put on a good show. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Heh, I appreciate the compliment! I worried I was laying it on too thick...
Choice 2: Your performance is a bit stilted.

8426,"Ignatz: In any case, let's do our best! We're coming for you, Fhirdiad! And so on, heh."
8427,"Lysithea: I've been informed of the surprise attack. That information could be devastating, were the enemy to find out. It moves me to know I've been trusted with it. Edelgard and those within the army... They really do trust me. Initially, I had my own motives for joining the Black Eagle Strike Force. But now, all I want is to support Edelgard."
8428,"Marianne: Even though we're denying the doctrine and fighting the knights, I keep praying to the goddess... When I think about those who have fallen in battle... I...I have no choice but to pray. The goddess of the church may be a fallacy, but I'm sure she still exists in some form. I'm weak. I would be nothing without her."
8429,"Leonie: Don't you think this plan to use the entire army for a surprise attack is a bit--I don't know--cowardly? Sorry, the word just kind of slipped out. Maybe don't tell Edelgard or Hubert I said that. No matter the target or strategy, I'll do my job."
8430,Alois: It's hard to feel cheery when you've just gone to battle against old friends. Mraaaugh! No! I will not let myself be gloomy!
8431,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Go easy on yourself.

Alois: Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it."
8432,"Choice 1: Go easy on yourself.

Alois: Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it."
8435,"Alois: Fishing, huh? That may brighten my mood a bit, now that you mention it."
8436,"Alois: I'm sure it must be even harder for you, to fight against your students. When times are tough, just remember, you can always rely on your old pal Alois!"
8437,Shamir: Last month's fight with the Knights of Seiros was a disaster.
8438,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you all right?
Shamir: Are you asking me if I'm OK with killing my former colleagues?
Choice 2: You seem fine. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: I am. I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies."
8439,"Choice 1: Are you all right?
Shamir: Are you asking me if I'm OK with killing my former colleagues?"
8440,Shamir: Are you asking me if I'm OK with killing my former colleagues?

Shamir: I am. I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies."
8442,Shamir: I am. I never believed in Seiros. And my old colleagues are now just enemies.
8443,Shamir: Sometimes it's easier to get by without any personal attachment or religious beliefs.
8444,"Hanneman: There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've often thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all."
8445,"Manuela: How have we come to this? Fighting the archbishop and her knights... I'd never imagined... I hate this. So much. Professor, I tried. I gave treatment to everyone I could, but...but lives were still lost. The infirmary is as much a morgue right now as it is a place of care and healing..."
8446,Jeritza: The Knights of Seiros... They certainly know how to inflict pain. However. The demon within me will be satiated only by fighting you.
8447,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
8448,Fleche: My brother fought proudly to the end and died an honorable death. He said something to me before the battle. That he was entrusting his dream to me... I'm gonna see this battle through to the end. I'm gonna fight for my brother!
8449,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Between Garreg Mach and Fhirdiad stretch the plains of Tailtean. That's the sight of the ancient battle where Nemesis, the King of Liberation, fought the prophet Seiros. If our forces end up fighting our enemies there... It'll be a clash passed down through the ages!"
8450,"Soldier: The old general who serves the Rowe family in Arianrhod is known for being a curmudgeon. Even if we invited him to join our side, he probably just wouldn't respond."
8451,"Merchant: Driving back the Knights of Seiros is a big deal for the Imperial army. Defeating the Alliance was hugely exciting, but this victory will probably just add to your reputation. Now if only you could sway the loyalties of the Kingdom's lords... Is that even possible?"
8452,"Soldier: Next we'll be headed to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad to begin the invasion, right? I wonder if we can defeat the Tempest King... We have to!"
8453,"Soldier: That was an unexpectedly fierce battle. The Knights of Seiros were tough opponents. If the archbishop had been there, we would have been in trouble. If it hadn't been for the effort of the main force... Who even knows."
8454,"Soldier: Destroying Seteth is a big achievement, but as long as the archbishop remains in good health, we must remain vigilant. One day they'll probably try to surprise attack us again. We have to attack them first!"
8455,"Former Monk: I dedicated my life to serving the church. However... Now, all that comes from the church is talk of spilling blood. Now that we've even lost Seteth, the possibility of the church returning to its former power is slim. Today I came to beg the goddess to grant me leave to quit my position. From tomorrow, I live by my own values."
8456,"Citizen: Randolph has fallen. He was a good person... It's a shame. When someone close to you dies, you really feel the horrors of war. Please watch out for yourself."
8457,"Scholar: You must know about the Western Church in the Kingdom, and the Eastern Church in the Alliance. But you probably don't know about the Southern Church. It used to exist a long time ago, in Enbarr. About 120 years ago, they had a massive insurrection. The bishop of the Southern Church who participated was exiled by the furious emperor. After that, the Empire reconciled with the Central Church, but relations continued to be strained. That history has probably laid the groundwork for the current antagonism among the Empire's citizens."
8458,"Yuri: The church smiles warmly on all who pay reverence, but defy them, and... Well, that's another story. The way the Knights of Seiros fight is cold-blooded and ruthless. Coming from me, you get the implications."
8459,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is everyone in Abyss OK? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Yeah, somehow. There are no good ways out of here, so we're lucky they never came through.
Choice 2: I'm glad we did it

8464,"Yuri: So, Arianrhod next, huh? I've got some fond memories of that place."
8465,"[[[Balthus]]:' So about this surprise attack. It's all over if the details leak, yeah? I know my shoulders are broad, but you sure you wanna lay a secret like that on 'em? I'm no war hero. In fact, I'm a wanted man. If I were you, I wouldn't trust me with something that important..."

8483,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. As you know, I'm the anointed alpha of Abyss. But this lady's been standing watch for a while. She can probably hear us talking even now..."
8484,"Imperial Solider: Yes, I can. I'm here by order of Lord Hubert. That is all I'm at liberty to reveal at present."
8485,"Abysskeeper: Wow. Impressive. You've really got a knack for this, lady. Ever think of making this a full-time gig? I could use the company... I mean, the backup."
8486,Imperial Soldier: My mission concludes at the end of the month. Deepest apologies.
8487,"Rogue: My friend and I were messing around the other day, and an Imperial general stopped to talk to us. ""If you've got that much energy,"" he said, ""you should fight for the Imperial army!"" Honestly, maybe we should think about it..."
8488,Rogue: What a pain. What an absolute pain...
8489,"Byleth:

8494,Hubert: Would you assist us in securing more resources?
8495,"Hubert: Thank you for helping to gather resources. Please accept this simple gift, by way of compensation."
8496,"Hubert: Trade among merchants has boomed since we annexed the Alliance territories. That is all well and good, but we should not leave them defenseless, lest disaster strike."
8497,Hubert: I was pleased to hear you rescued those merchants. A strong economy bodes well for us. Fine work.
8498,"Girl: When I got home after eating, I realized that the special thing Anna asked me to look after had vanished! Oh, what do I do..."
8499,"Girl: Hey, thanks a lot! From now on, I'll do my absolute best to live up to the standards Anna set for all merchants! Oh, and if I open a shop, I hope you'll pay it a visit or three, Professor!"
8500,Rodrigue: Cornelia! I have a report from our scouts. The Imperial army that departed from Garreg Mach en route to the capital now appears to be marching here.
8501,Cornelia: What did you just say?!
8502,Rodrigue: The speed of the army's movement quickens... They will be here to invade within days. I just sent some of my troops to support the capital. It is likely to be a fierce fight...
8503,Cornelia: How could this be? I have not heard a thing about... Ah... I understand now. I am the target.
8504,Rodrigue: You? Are you sure they do not mean to take Arianrhod for strategic reasons?
8505,"Cornelia: It would appear so from the outside. However, the circumstances are not that simple. And will you calm yourself? It will not be a fierce fight whatsoever. The sweet children I have prepared will protect Arianrhod well..."
8506,Rodrigue: Cornelia...
8507,"Hubert: Arianhrod is a fortress city that was built about 400 years ago. Originally a base on the front lines of the battle against the Kingdom, it was built using Imperial money and technology."
8508,"Edelgard: However, the head of House Rowe secretly planned to betray the Empire. As the fortress neared completion, it was rebuilt as a base to defend against the Empire. When the fortress was completed, House Rowe declared its vassalage to the Kingdom."
8509,"Hubert: Since then, Arianrhod has never fallen. Not once. The beautiful white walls that protect it against its enemies have earned it the nickname the Silver Maiden. In the end, that is all it is to the Empire... the Silver Maiden stands as a bitter memory."
8510,Petra: We will now be destroying that memory. The past is the past. Now is now.
8511,"Caspar: A fortress that has never fallen?! Ooh, I can't wait to make it fall!"
8512,"Ferdinand: How savage of you. And yet, I must say I agree with the sentiment. Let us take the sturdy Arianrhod and continue our march against the Kingdom!"
8513,Bernadetta: An invincible fortress? Sounds perfect!
8514,"Linhardt: Unfortunately, it will soon no longer be invincible. The Silver Maiden's iron skin is about to be damaged. It's sad, really."
8515,"Petra: Is it silver or iron? Use your language with clarity, please."
8516,"Dorothea: Really, Lin. There must be a better way to say that. Since we are attacking a heavily guarded place, we must take extra care to prevent allies from getting injured."
8517,"Edelgard: Thank you, everyone. I'm counting on all of you. Now, let's resume our advance."
8518,Hubert: This battle is for the future of Fódlan...
8519,Suggested Level: 33
8520,Victory Conditions: Defeat all enemy commanders.
8521,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle."
8522,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
8523,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle.
8524,Cornelia: How could they deceive me and close in on Arianrhod?! But it's not like I'm just going to just stand by and watch... I will slaughter them all.
8525,"Edelgard: So this is the Silver Maiden... Seeing it with my own eyes, I finally understand its strength. Especially the fact that its strength is distributed across its frontal defenses. We'll attack the front and keep our enemy occupied while the others by the east gate."
8526,"Cornelia: Titanus, my lovely dolls... Seek out the enemy and destroy them! And if the chance presents itself, I wouldn't mind being rid of those unsightly Kingdom forces too!"
8527,Hubert: Are those Cornelia's magical weapons? Impressive.
8528,Felix: Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all. (If Felix was not recruited)
8529,"Ingrid: We all chose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death! (If Ingrid was not recruited)"
8530,"Edelgard: Traps awaiting us inside the castle... What a nuisance. But with such large-scale traps, there must be some sort of mechanism to control them."
8531,Hubert: The traps are still functional. There must be more of these devices.
8532,Edelgard: The traps are disabled.
8533,"Ingrid: I will protect Arianrhod to the bitter end. This I have promised to my ancestors, to His Majesty, and to myself!"
8534,"Ingrid: You have chosen to assist the Empire, even while knowing of their deeds. I am truly disappointed in you, Professor. Prepare yourself, heel of the Empire! A wretch like you will never be qualified to rule over Fódlan!"
8535,"Ingrid: Felix, why?"
8536,Felix: Urrgh...
8537,"Ingrid: You've betrayed His Majesty, Glenn, and Lord Rodrigue. You've betrayed just about everyone!"
8538,"Felix: You couldn't possibly understand. If you're going to stand in my way, I'll have to kill you."
8539,Ingrid: Sylvain. This isn't funny. What are you doing?
8540,"Sylvain: I'm sorry, Ingrid. I believe in what the professor is trying to do more than I do in my own country."
8541,Ingrid: Perhaps my blade will cut away the scales from your eyes!
8542,Ingrid: Maybe...I've become like him...
8543,"Felix: There you are, standing before me, ready for death. I will administer the finishing blow."
8544,Felix: Part of me has been waiting for this since I met you. No need for chitchat. Come at me!
8545,"Sylvain: Hey, Felix? Remember when we were kids and we made a promise about dying together?"
8546,Felix: I remember.
8547,"Sylvain: Well, seems we're about to kill each other."
8548,"Felix: Sorry, Sylvain. You'll die first."
8549,"Felix: All that talk about chivalry and loyalty, only to turn against your homeland."
8550,"Ingrid: Maybe I'm not a knight after all. Not in the traditional sense, anyway. I've betrayed lord and family alike. And I've done so because I believe in the professor. I fight for that which I believe in!"
8551,"Felix: So, you won't step aside. Then I'll have to kill you."
8552,Felix: I failed...
8553,"Rodrigue: Felix, I'm so sorry... I swear to avenge you! (If not defeated)"
8554,"Rodrigue: I am the king's shield, devoted to protecting the Kingdom, as well as the king's lance, who kills his foes! In the name of House Fraldarius...I will defeat you all!"
8555,"Rodrigue: So, my foolish son... You took it upon yourself to leave your family behind."
8556,Felix: I'm not coming back. I won't serve the boar.
8557,Rodrigue: It's a father's duty to settle his child's failures. Felix... You must die here and now!
8558,Rodrigue: So this is it... Your Majesty... Please bring us victory!
8559,Felix: Father... I will fight in your stead. (If not recruited or defeated)
8560,"Gwendal: So. You've chosen to turn your blade against the count. Heh. Never thought I'd see the day, mongrel."
8561,"Yuri: And yet you are seeing it, aren't you? Say what you will. I know your true feelings for me. Sure, you watched my back by order of the count. But you cared too. You were the only one who treated me as an equal."
8562,Gwendal: That is all in the past. This is no time for misplaced sentimentality. I must do what I came here to do.
8563,"Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!"
8564,Gwendal: So this is where I meet my end...
8565,"Hapi: So it is you. When I heard you were a court mage or whatever, I could hardly believe it. Well, no point in standing around and chatting about old times. Let's get this over with."
8566,"Cornelia: Oh my, what a charming guest. Let me take care of you..."
8567,"Cornelia: Ah, such a shame... I always thought we'd end up being good friends. But here you are as my enemy... The only thing left to do is to kill you, right?"
8568,Cornelia: Gah! So this is as far as I could get...
8569,"Cornelia: Ah... All is in accordance with this carefully crafted script of ours... What a masterpiece! What a delightful dance... (Note: this line was mistranslated from the original Japanese text. The original line aligns to ""Ah, so this... is the script you have carefully crafted... What a masterpiece! The ones that were being forced to dance around were in fact...us!"")"
8570,"Edelgard: Victory is ours! Arianrhod has fallen! Another army will take control of Arianrhod. As for us, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. It won't be long before all of Fódlan is unified. Everyone, this is our last push. Our goal is within reach!"
8571,"Edelgard: What turn of events has brought you so suddenly to Garreg Mach, Uncle?"
8572,"Lord Arundel: Well, my business in the old Alliance territory had roughly finished. I wanted to see the face of my niece, who so bravely took Arianrhod. I have heard that it was done with truly magnificent tact. And that you even deceived some of your allies."
8573,"Edelgard: I'm happy to have earned your praise. However, to say that I deceived my allies is a bit misleading. I despise leaks of information, and there may have been a church rat hiding amongst our ranks."
8574,"Lord Arundel: Ah, I see. However, there are some unfortunate consequences. Cornelia surely planned to betray them, but...she has been struck down. Truly wasteful meddling. Unless... Was it your intention to kill her?"
8575,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It was. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: Professor, don't joke about that. The only ones we came to kill were our enemies.
Choice 2: It was not.
Choice 3: I didn't care either way.
Edelgard: Indeed. We came only to kill our enemies."
8576,"Choice 1: It was. (Relationship with Edelgard up)
Edelgard: Professor, don't joke about that. The only ones we came to kill were our enemies."
8577,"Edelgard: Professor, don't joke about that. The only ones we came to kill were our enemies."
8578,Choice 2: It was not.
8579,"Choice 3: I didn't care either way.
Edelgard: Indeed. We came only to kill our enemies."
8580,Edelgard: Indeed. We came only to kill our enemies.
8581,Edelgard: She used a terrible magic weapon... Dolls that she could move and fight with. Did you know about them?
8582,"Lord Arundel: Well now... If that were the case, would it not have been better to keep her as an ally? If you are only capable of such imprudence, this dark cloud might hang over the Empire's future as well."
8583,"Edelgard: Thank you for your concern. However, I will sweep aside any darkness that comes our way."
8584,Lord Arundel: I will be praying. Praying that the Empire will not become another Arianrhod.
8585,Edelgard: Another Arianrhod? Just what do you mean...
8586,Lord Arundel: Hmph. I must take my leave now. Farewell.
8587,"Hubert: Lady Edelgard, there you are. We just received some truly shocking news. It is said that pillars of light have rained from the heavens and disintegrated Arianrhod."
8588,Edelgard: Disintegrated?
8589,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How is that possible...
Hubert: It was likely some type of magic... Perhaps a forbidden art.
Choice 2: Was it Lord Arundel...
Hubert: Why would he do that?
(Byleth nods.)
Hubert: Was Lord Arundel just here? So that would mean..."
8590,"Choice 1: How is that possible...
Hubert: It was likely some type of magic... Perhaps a forbidden art."
8591,Hubert: It was likely some type of magic... Perhaps a forbidden art.
8592,"Choice 2: Was it Lord Arundel...
Hubert: Why would he do that?
(Byleth nods.)
Hubert: Was Lord Arundel just here? So that would mean..."
8593,Hubert: Why would he do that?
8594,(Byleth nods.)
8595,Hubert: Was Lord Arundel just here? So that would mean...
8596,Edelgard: Hubert! Give me the full report!
8597,"Hubert: Ah, my apologies. I, of all people, should be able to control my discomposure. The pillars of light descended and exploded, resulting in the complete destruction of the main building and the north wall. It is believed that all key people within House Rowe, including its leader, were killed. Of the Imperial officers and men we kept at Arianrhod, about a third are unaccounted for..."
8598,"Edelgard: It can't be true... So...this is my uncle's trump card. In exchange for striking down Cornelia, he has destroyed Arianrhod!"
8599,Hubert: Perhaps we acted too soon in our disposal of Cornelia...
8600,"Edelgard: No. If we'll be fighting them soon, there's no disadvantage to weakening their forces. It's also extremely valuable that we forced them to show their hand. Hubert, the investigation you made into the legend of Ailell, the Valley of Torment... This is likely what took place back then as well."
8601,Hubert: Yes... The probability is high.
8602,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Valley of Torment?
Choice 2: The same thing happened in the past? (Relationship with Hubert up)
Hubert: Yes, it is quite likely."
8603,Choice 1: Valley of Torment?
8604,Choice 2: The same thing happened in the past? (Relationship with Hubert up)
8605,"Hubert: Yes, it is quite likely."
8606,"Hubert: North of Garreg Mach there is a valley where the earth is always aflame. Once, javelins of light fell from the sky there... They pierced the earth and set the forest ablaze, creating a land of torment. We believed it may have been the work of the goddess, but... It was actually an attack by those who slither in the dark. That sums up all that we know."
8607,"Edelgard: By giving us that knowledge, those who died at Arianrhod will not have died in vain."
8608,Hubert: Indeed. It would be good to control the flow of this information.
8609,"Edelgard: True. We'll conceal this from everyone as best as we can. I trust you, my teacher."
8610,"Edelgard: I'm sure everyone has heard about what transpired at Arianrhod. The church has displayed their cowardice by indiscriminately using forbidden practices to kill the residents there. Their victims also include members of House Rowe, the Imperial army, and many, many more."
8611,"Hubert: According to our investigation, the forbidden attack that destroyed Arianrhod cannot be used again so quickly. Even so, we cannot delay our efforts. We must put a stop to all of this by the end of next month. The leader of one of the Imperial factions has already initiated an attack on the Fraldarius territory lost by Rodrigue... Soon, all obstacles blocking our path to Fhirdiad will have vanished."
8612,"Edelgard: A cornered animal is at its most deadly. We must move quickly. Next, we march through the Tailtean Plains. After that, we destroy Fhirdiad. At that time, complete Imperial control over Fódlan will finally be a reality."
8613,"Caspar: Ah, I'm shaking with excitement! Bring on the battle!"
8614,Dorothea: I understand that a confrontation is inevitable. Still... I wonder if there's some path we could take that would cause less suffering...
8615,"Petra: This is the only path for the goal we are reaching for, and so we must keep walking on it. We are walking down the path to a better tomorrow."
8616,"Linhardt: A cornered church... Hmm, well, count me out from any forbidden sorcery that can destroy whole cities. If only there was an easier way to get more information on Crests and Relics..."
8617,"Ferdinand: You are as negative as usual, Linhardt. We have but one order. To emerge victorious!"
8618,"Bernadetta: We're going to win this! We really are! After all, if we lose, everything will be terrible forever! Oh, no way! We can't let that happen!"
8619,"Caspar: There's a lot to worry about, but...I'm sure it will all work out! We'll win no matter what!"

They plan for the Imperial army stationed in former Alliance territory to take over Fraldarius Land so they are able to attack Fhirdiad from two directions. King Dimitri anticipates the Imperial army's strategy, leading the Kingdom army and Rhea's Knights of Seiros out of Fhirdiad, and prepares to intercept the Imperial army at the Tailtean Plains.
"
8673,"Tailtean Plains | Daytime
"
8674,"Dimitri: So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue,... I swear that I will not allow your death to be in vain..."
8675,"(Alternative version) Dimitri: So... Arianrhod has fallen. Rodrigue, Felix, Ingrid... I swear that I will not allow your deaths to be in vain... (Note: if you recruited Felix and not Ingrid or vice versa Dimitri does not mention Felix or Ingrid depending if you recruited Ingrid and not Felix or reverse only if you did not recruit them both does he mention them.)"
8676,"Rhea: The scouts have just now returned. It seems the Imperial army is marching toward the Kingdom capital. Are you certain about this, Dimitri? As king, do you think it wise to intercept them yourself?"
8677,"Dimitri: No need to worry yourself. Even if I am defeated, the Blaiddyd bloodline will live on. And the Kingdom's territory has never been rich in resources. If the castle falls under siege, our loss is inevitable. I will deploy my army onto the plains and wait for the enemy. Please position your forces so that they can flank the Imperial army."
8678,"Rhea: Yes, given the present situation, making the plains our battlefield is a logical choice. I have no objection. However..."
8679,Dimitri: There is only one person I am after. I have no interest in any other prey.
8680,"Rhea: I will take you at your word. Erasing the other child's existence is my task, and mine alone. I will get you back, Mother... I promise..."
8681,"Hubert: What do you think, Lady Edelgard? Will they shut themselves inside of Fhirdiad?"
8682,"Edelgard: They will try to intercept us. Of course, Fhirdiad will not fall so easily. Even so... If were to cut off their supply with a large army, it would eventually fall. It makes much more sense for them to wager everything on a victory at the Tailtean Plains."
8683,Byleth: The Tailtean Plains...
8684,"Edelgard: The same plains where the so-called divine Seiros defeated Nemesis, the King of Liberation, in a comeback victory over 1,000 years ago. And about 400 years ago, the hero Loog created the Kingdom by defeating the emperor of the time on those very plains. Their goal must be to recreate that scene."
8685,"Hubert: Yes, I suppose so. Although the Imperial army is powerful, if we were to compare the strength of our best to the best of the Knights of Seiros, we would likely come up short. The Kingdom's army and House Blaiddyd are also renowned for their unmatched persistence. On the battlefield, it can be assumed that their one and only goal will be to strike you down."
8686,Edelgard: Are you telling me to stay off the battlefield?
8687,"Hubert: Naturally. You are their aim, Your Majesty. You must know it only makes sense to keep you out of their reach."
8688,"Edelgard: And you must know that, at a time like this, I absolutely cannot withdraw."
8689,Hubert: Of course I know that. That is why I will refrain from asking you again to stay away from the battlefield.
8690,"Edelgard: The Immaculate One, descendants of the 10 Elites, and other extremely fearsome foes await us. But with the help of our friends, we have a chance of defeating them. We're the only ones who can. Within our group, I am included among those with the king of strength we need to win. I absolutely will not remove myself from the front lines. Professor you have that same strength as well, whether or not you realize it yet."

8697,"Edelgard: This month, we will take all of the military force we can muster and advance to the Kingdom capital of Fhirdiad. I have no intention of retreating to Garreg Mach after we've come this far. We will only return after we've conquered Fhirdiad and put an end to this war. Be sure to steel your heart and ready yourself for the battle ahead."

8705,"Hubert: Tch. Lord Arundel. As long as he exists, Lady Edelgard will..."
8706,Byleth: Just who is that man?
8707,"Hubert: I believe I have explained before that he is the one who commanded the likes of Solon and Kronya. Cornelia, whom we defeated Arianrhod, was also one of his. An irksome sort. We must not fail to be rid of him. He is a maggot, crawling in the filth of the world, feeding off the Empire like a parasite."
8708,"Ferdinand: Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital... From the Empire's perspective, it seems like the northernmost edge of the world. I have come a long way, following you and Edelgard. To think, what if I had succeeded Duke Aegir as prime minister? I would never have had all these experiences."
8709,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You've really grown up. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)

8714,"Ferdinand: For now, let us join together and walk the path that Her Majesty lays out."
8715,"Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle."
8716,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're far from safe ourselves. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our own lives, Professor.
Choice 2: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Choice 3: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good."

Choice 1: We'll find out if we conquer the Kingdom capital.

8747,"Petra: I have...worries. What have I been achieving? When the war is ended, I will be returning to Brigid with many...much new potential. But have I had enough growth to become the ruler?"

8754,"Felix: They used to call my father the ""Shield of Faerghus."" Now he's gone, and Arianrhod has fallen. Yet the Knights of Seiros remain. As does the boar. What terrifies me most is his stubbornness. He'll keep on fighting to the last man. He's a monster. I've seen it firsthand."
8755,"Ashe: I hear that House Blaiddyd commands some strong and well-trained troops. People say they're fiercely devoted and will gladly die for their king. Reminds me of Lonato's men-the ones we faced back in Magdred. Unlike those civilian soldiers though, here we're up against the best that the Faerghus army has to offer. It's going to be a hard battle, but if there's a peaceful tomorrow waiting on the other side, it'll be worth it."
8756,"Sylvain: I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Kingdom. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?"
8757,"Mercedes: When I first enrolled in the Officers Academy, I never thought it would come to this. I can't believe we're waging war...against the church, no less."

8778,"Lorenz: Personally I take no issue with attacking Lady Rhea. But the eagerness of my fellow nobles does vex me, despite so many grand displays of piety from them in the past. It gives me the impression that faith is little more than a tool they use to maintain their positions of power."
8779,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Disappointed in the nobility? (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: I suppose I am in no position to judge them, being among their number myself. Still, it irritates me.

8835,"Hanneman: When Edelgard first invited me to join this army, I, to be frank, thought her dream utterly ridiculous. But at my advanced age, I was tempted by the notion of chasing a seemingly impossible dream through blood, sweat, and tears. Five years on, the unification of Fódlan is slowly becoming a reality. Now I feel... It may soon be possible to abolish the nobility, and create a world where none need suffer due to crests."

My brother had sorted out all his personal affairs, but apparently he'd forgotten about his work duties. So now I've got a ton more work on my plate... Oh, Brother, why must you be so careless... Once this war is over, I'm gonna take a vacation and get some well-earned rest back home with my mother."

8859,"Soldier: If the enemy forces come to intercept us, chances are high that we'll clash on the Tailtean Plains. The Tailtean Plains were the site of a famous battle in ancient times, right? That's what some book-type at the library said, at any rate."
8860,"Soldier: The Knights of Seiros are led by the archbishop herself, and the Kingdom army is led by none other than the king... I have faith that the Imperial army will prevail, but it still makes my knees feel a bit wobbly..."
8861,"Former Monk: Before I left the church, I recall Lady Rhea saying something strange. Something about how she would recover her mother, no matter what... Do you think Lady Rhea's mother is buried in Garreg Mach or something?"
8862,"Merchant: I thought you were going to attack the Kingdom capital, but you attacked Arianrhod instead? Well, you sure had me fooled! She's a tricksy one, that Lady Edelgard. But...this time you really are going for the capital, right? I wish you the best of luck."
8863,"Soldier: I have a fiancée back home, and I promised her I'd come back alive. No matter how tough the fight gets, I won't die. I have to survive and make it back to her!"
8864,"Scholar: Over a thousand years ago now, not long after the Adrestian Empire was founded... The first emperor and his army, with the aid of Seiros, set out on a campaign to the north with the aim of unifying Fódlan. Meanwhile, in the northern reaches of Fódlan, Nemesis, the King of Liberation, raised an army to take down the Empire... Both armies clashed on the Tailtean Plains, where Seiros felled Nemesis. As a result, the conflict ended in a victory for the Empire. It's known as the Battle of Tailtean."
8865,"Yuri: Seems like a lot of people from House Rowe died in Arianrhod... I know Edelgard is saying it's the church's fault, and she hasn't been shy to express that. But...that doesn't seem right to me."
8866,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yeah... (Relationship with Yuri goes up.)
Yuri: My take? There exist some dangerous folks capable of destroying strongholds with ease...
Choice 2: If not the church, then who?
Yuri: You should ask Edelgard or Hubert. They'd know more than I do."
8867,"Choice 1: Yeah... (Relationship with Yuri goes up.)
Yuri: My take? There exist some dangerous folks capable of destroying strongholds with ease..."

Yuri: You should ask Edelgard or Hubert. They'd know more than I do."
8870,Yuri: You should ask Edelgard or Hubert. They'd know more than I do.
8871,"Yuri: Some think that all we have to do is take down Fhirdiad to end the war, but I don't think it's quite that simple."
8872,Balthus: So it's finally time to take on Fhirdiad. Can't wait to get in there and show 'em what I'm made of. Hopefully I get a go at that Dimitri guy before all is said and done...
8873,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why would you want that? (Relationship with Balthus goes up.)
Balthus: They say he has inhuman strength, yeah? Best way to find out is to throw fists with the guy.
Choice 2: What an odd thing to hope for...
Balthus: It's war, pal. If you can't be blunt on the battlefield, what are we even fighting for?"
8874,"Choice 1: Why would you want that? (Relationship with Balthus goes up.)
Balthus: They say he has inhuman strength, yeah? Best way to find out is to throw fists with the guy."

8877,"Balthus: It's war, pal. If you can't be blunt on the battlefield, what are we even fighting for?"
8878,"Balthus: He may be the Tempest King of Fhirdiad, but I'm the Grappling King of the world! My domain is way bigger. Grab a front-row seat if you can manage. These arms of mine will knock some sense back into that towhead of his."
8879,Constance: The war of Fódlan unification is finally reaching its climax! I must surpass myself in the struggle to come if Her Majesty is to recognize my power.
8880,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's go for it together.
Constance: But don't you see? Your presence would diminish the grandeur of my achievements!
Choice 2: Go for it. (Relationship with Constance goes up.)
Constance: I intend to. The fate of House Nuvelle hangs in the balance!"
8881,"Choice 1: Let's go for it together.

8884,Constance: I intend to. The fate of House Nuvelle hangs in the balance!
8885,"Constance: The culmination of all my studies, all my magical experiments, shall be unleashed in battle!"
8886,"Hapi: If we win this next battle, it won't just be a victory against the Kingdom, but also the church. Maybe they'll all die—even the people from the church who lied to me and locked me up."
8887,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Would that bother you? (Relationship with Hapi goes up.)
Choice 2: Is that what you want?"
8888,Choice 1: Would that bother you? (Relationship with Hapi goes up.)
8889,Choice 2: Is that what you want?
8890,"Hapi: I don't care either way. If they died, I would say, ""Well, that happened,"" and move on. I don't owe them my compassion. They've never shown me any."
8891,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. The war is careening headfirst toward its grand finale. Do me a favor and get through this mess alive, OK? After the dust settles, maybe I'll go on to guard other entrances in other parts of the world. I'm a dreamer, my friend. Always have been."
8892,"Resident: Word is Garreg Mach's starting to look like a real town again. With the Empire winning one battle after another, it seems like the end to the war is finally in sight. There's hope for recovery now. Even for Abyss."
8893,"Resident: I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff. There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five years on... It's just a fact of life. What? There have been lots of battles on the surface recently? I hadn't heart! See what I mean?!"
8894,"Soldier: Whenever I think about the next battle, my knees won't stop shaking. I'm scared of getting hurt, or worse... Is there a medicinal herb I can use to calm my nerves?"
8895,"Soldier: It really calms you down if you make a tea out of it. Ah, even the smell is soothing! Thank you so much. Now I feel like I can fight again."
8896,"Jeralt: Sorry... It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her."
8897,Byleth: (Someone I love...)
8898,"Seiros: Mother... Oddly the rain has come to fall yet again. At this place, once again... I will fight to take you back... The one who keeps me from seeing you again... I will be sure to return them to the earth from whence they came. The foolish descendant of Hresvelg who bares her fangs at me will suffer the same fate..."
8899,Church Soldier: Lady Rhea...
8900,"Seiros: Call me Seiros now. I am no longer the archbishop, but rather a warrior."
8901,"Church Soldier: Yes, Lady Seiros. Because of the rain, we have not yet confirmed the position of our enemy or of the Kingdom army..."
8902,"Seiros: Search the route to Fhirdiad. It is unlikely that they have strayed far from it. When you discover the Imperial army's main force, commence the attack. If the Kingdom's army has already engaged, flank the enemy as planned."
8903,Church Soldier: As you wish.
8904,"Seiros: Wait for me, dear child... I will be paying you a visit soon... When this sword has been plunged into your chest... Yes, that is the very moment I have long for..."
8905,"Dimitri: I was hoping they would strike the church first... We must have miscalculated the rate of their advance. Reorganize the formation. We have no choice but to buy time until the church arrives. It will be a long battle... Are you afraid, Dedue?"
8906,"Dedue: No. So long as I am at your side, there is nothing to fear."
8907,"Dimitri: I can always rely on you. Just watch, my friend... We will prevail. I will not fail to get revenge for all who have fallen."
8908,"Dedue: I would follow you anywhere, Your Majesty. Good luck out there."
8909,"Dimitri: You as well, Dedue. You as well."
8910,"Dedue: Your Majesty... For you, I will..."
8911,Edelgard: A flag of blue is flapping in the rain... It must be the Kingdom army.
8912,"Hubert: Yes. It seems that King Dimitri is leading the troops himself. However, the Knights of Seiros have yet to be seen. Perhaps they have split up."
8913,"Edelgard: I can't imagine that Dimitri would leave the capital to the church and face us with the Kingdom army alone. He must be planning to use the church to gain the upper hand in battle. With the rain, that must be difficult to coordinate... Still, the Knights of Seiros must be around here somewhere."
8914,Hubert: Then we should be on alert for attacks from the side and rear as well. Inform the entire army.
8915,"Imperial Soldier: Yes, sir!"
8916,"Hubert: Now that I think about it, the Kingdom's Army is quite different than it once was. They have taken a position of interception. In the past, the king would have introduced himself before beginning a fair fight."
8917,"Edelgard: A fair fight... The words alone remind me of how he once was. Don't you agree, Professor?"
8918,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Who might that be?
Edelgard: Oh, have you forgotten already? Dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
Choice 2: Dimitri?
Edelgard: Yes. He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
Choice 3: Claude? (if Claude was spared)
Edelgard: Of all the people in the world, why would talk of a ""fair fight"" remind you of Claude? I'm talking about Dimitri. Have you forgotten? He often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8919,"Choice 1: Who might that be?
Edelgard: Oh, have you forgotten already? Dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8920,"Edelgard: Oh, have you forgotten already? Dimitri often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8921,"Choice 2: Dimitri?
Edelgard: Yes. He often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8922,Edelgard: Yes. He often spoke of such things back at the monastery.
8923,"Choice 3: Claude? (if Claude was spared)
Edelgard: Of all the people in the world, why would talk of a ""fair fight"" remind you of Claude? I'm talking about Dimitri. Have you forgotten? He often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8924,"Edelgard: Of all the people in the world, why would talk of a ""fair fight"" remind you of Claude? I'm talking about Dimitri. Have you forgotten? He often spoke of such things back at the monastery."
8925,"Hubert: Well, at the present, the words ""fair fight"" do not seem to suit Dimitri anymore. He dislikes making victims of his friends, but other than that, he will do most anything these days... If he stops at nothing to continue the onslaught, I cannot imagine what will become of the battlefield."
8926,"Edelgard: True. As soon as we can take our battle formation, we must advance. Dimitri, that past you cling to... I will soon free you from it."
8927,Suggested Level: 35
8928,Victory Conditions: Defeat all enemy commanders.
8929,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle."
8930,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
8931,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle.
8932,"Dimitri: Ah, here you are, Edelgard...at your eternal resting place. You have trampled and stolen and blinded yourself to the truth. Today, I will have vengeance for all you have done!"
8933,"Edelgard: With this battle, the main force of the Kingdom will be annihilated! Leave no enemy general alive. Least of all King Dimitri!"
8934,"Hubert: We are uncertain of the enemy's plans, so let us advance our troops with caution. The Knights of Seiros have yet to show themselves. They will join the battle at some point. Be ready."
8935,Kingdom General: We're first in line! Charge! (if Sylvain was recruited)
8936,"Sylvain: Don't let this chance for vengeance go to waste! (if Sylvain was not recruited)
(Alternate): Time to join the front lines. We should all show a little loyalty from time to time, yeah? (if both Ingrid and Felix were recruited and are alive)"
8937,"(Alternate): Time to join the front lines. We should all show a little loyalty from time to time, yeah? (if both Ingrid and Felix were recruited and are alive)"
8938,Kingdom Soldier: Glory to the flag of the knights! Good fortune to His Majesty! Fortune...to Faerghus... Graaaaargh!
8939,Hubert: What the— That Kingdom soldier just changed into a Demonic Beast. Did Thales... No. This is something simpler.
8940,Dimitri: This is the work of a Crest Stone... But why...
8941,Dedue: I gave them Crest Stones from the castle vaults.
8942,Dimitri: You fool! Why did you do that?
8943,"Dedue: If we lose here, the Kingdom falls. It's our only hope."
8944,"Dimitri: You call this hope?! Well, we must now claim victory so their deaths were not in vain."
8945,"Dedue: Yes, Your Majesty. I am with you."
8946,Kingdom General: Gautier reinforcements have arrived! We shall crush the Empire weaklings! (If Mercedes was recruited)
8947,Mercedes: Don't worry everyone! The reinforcements have arrived! (If Mercedes was not recruited)
8948,Edelgard: Reinforcements... We're in danger. We must defeat the enemy's generals before we're overwhelmed.
8949,"Hubert: This battle may turn against us if we allow any more of them to transform. We don't know which soldiers have Crest Stones. We must do away with all of them, and quickly!"
8950,"Rhea: How could I be late, when I finally have the opportunity to destroy the fallen one? This rain...it is the lamentation of my mother... Observe. I shall not fail in restoring balance."
8951,Sylvain: So what are you waiting for? Let's finish this today.
8952,"Sylvain: Professor! Has it really been five years? We ought to raise a glass for the occasion. Celebrate your return. Nah, I'd rather commemorate it with your death."
8953,"Sylvain: Professor, there's something I should admit. I've got some regrets about how our lives have gone. I should have made a proper attempt to woo you before now. Instead, I have to kill you."
8954,"Sylvain: Hey, Felix? Remember when we were kids and we made a promise about dying together?"
8955,Felix: I remember.
8956,"Sylvain: Well, seems we're about to kill each other."
8957,"Felix: Sorry, Sylvain. You'll die first."
8958,"Sylvain: Stand down, Ingrid. I know you don't want to die here."
8959,Ingrid: I will not. I'll never ally myself with the likes of you.
8960,Sylvain: Stubborn as ever. I always did like that about you.
8961,Ingrid: And you never cease to amaze me with your false flattery. Don't waste your breath.
8962,"Sylvain: I was such a fool. So...this is how it ends. Forgive me, Your Majesty. I'm...going on...ahead."
8963,"Dimitri: Thank you, Sylvain. Until we meet again on the other side... (if undefeated)"
8964,"Mercedes: It makes me so sad to fight against you, but I suppose that's how things go when you're at war. Why follow an emperor who would start such a war?"
8965,"Mercedes: I'm sorry, Professor. I can't join you... There are important things I must stay and protect."
8966,Annette: Mercie...
8967,"Mercedes: Now now, Annie. There's no need for that. This is a battlefield, after all."
8968,"Annette: I'm so sorry... You know that, don't you? And also know that you don't have to forgive me..."
8969,Mercedes: I was going to say the same thing. I'm so sorry if I cause you any pain.
8970,"Jeritza: Step back, Mercedes."
8971,"Mercedes: I won't. This is the path I have chosen. It's the same for you too, Emile. Is it not? Someday, we may meet again in another life. Whenever that happens, I hope that we'll remain side by side, always..."
8972,Jeritza: My dear sister... I am sorry.
8973,Constance: I cannot accept this! How dare they pit us against each other!
8974,"Mercedes: Then you should retreat, Constance. You know that I feel the same... I don't want to have to kill you."
8975,"Constance: I am sorry. There are things I must see through, even if it means striking you down!"
8976,Mercedes: And so it is. We cannot go back to how things once were...
8977,"Mercedes: I'm...I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay...on my feet."
8978,"Dimitri: Forgive me, Mercedes. Were it not for me, you wouldn't have gotten caught up in all this, and you might still be alive... (if undefeated)"
8979,Dedue: You will never understand the burden His Majesty carries on his shoulders!
8980,Dedue: It is a shame. I really believed you would come to believe His Majesty's perspective.
8981,Dedue: It is time. Your Majesty... I will avenge your father. You are the one true king...Dimitri. Grr... Grrrr!
8982,"Dimitri: Dedue! I will fight by your side until the bitter end... As long as I am with you, this lance of mine will know nothing of defeat!"
8983,Dedue: Your Majesty...you must survive...
8984,"Dimitri: Dedue... You fought well, my friend. (if undefeated)"
8985,Stone Demonic Beast: Urghh...
8986,Dimitri: Dedue... You fool...
8987,"Dimitri: You will not kill one more soul. You will not steal one more thing. I will not allow it. Here and now, I stand against you!"
8988,"Dimitri: Why did you choose Edelgard, Professor? Why did you choose to walk this savage, bloody path? I cannot shake this feeling of regret... Regret that I must kill you now."
8989,Dimitri: Must you continue to conquer? Continue to kill?
8990,Edelgard: Must you continue to reconquer? Continue to kill in retaliation? I will not stop. There is nothing I would not sacrifice to cut a path to Fódlan's new dawn!
8991,Dimitri: Enough of this madness! This future of yours is built on a foundation of corpses and tears!
8992,"Dimitri: Not only have you become the emperor's lap dog, but you have turned against your own people. From the depths of hell, you will regret tainting the land of Faerghus! (note: Dimitri will also say this for Felix before the aforementioned unique dialogue if Felix is the first Blue Lions student to confront him)"
8993,"Dimitri: You killed Rodrigue... your own father, Felix."
8994,Felix: I said I'd cut down anyone who stood in my way. Even my father. Even my friends.
8995,Dimitri: I see. That was all I needed to hear to finally work up the resolve to kill you.
8996,Dimitri: No! Not yet... I can't die just yet...
8997,"Sylvain: Dimitri, you idiot! Retreat! Wait, your injury... No! (if undefeated)"
8998,"Dedue: Fall back, Your Majesty! We cannot lose you! (if undefeated)"
8999,"Seiros: King Dimitri! There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell! (if undefeated, pre-v1.02) No... It can't be... There is no retreat for the Knights of Seiros! Fight until none are left standing! Slaughter them all and send them straight to hell! (if undefeated, post-v1.02)"
9000,"Seiros: You are all damned, with no hope of salvation. For the sin of insurgency, you shall be consigned to hell!"
9001,"Seiros: I once walked this world as Seiros, the warrior... and defeated the Fell King Nemesis. Now, here I stand, facing one who wields the same sword as he... The fate you have chosen is also the same as his... To die in torment upon my sword, as the very lifeblood you have forsaken spills onto the earth!"
9002,"Seiros: An ancestor of the Hresvelgs, who became Adrestia's first emperor... He saved me. Supported me. Gave his all to the cause of defeating Nemesis. That I should find myself here at Tailtean, striking down his scion..."
9003,"Edelgard: I don't advise presumptions, Rhea. I will not die by your hand."
9004,Seiros: How can this be? I lost to that thief?! Unacceptable!
9005,"Knight of Seiros: Watch out, Lady Rhea! Please retreat!"
9006,Seiros: Gyhh!
9007,"Dimitri: The Church of Seiros has fallen back, but we have no such luxury. Everyone, fight for your lives! Victory to Faerghus! (if undefeated)"
9008,"Dimitri: Edelgard! You... I will kill you! You will know the regret of my father, who was killed for you! Of my stepmother, who was slain by her own daughter! You will bow your head before all the lives you trampled for your ideals before you die in misery!"
9009,"Edelgard: Your obsession with me is appalling. If you were a normal human, you would most certainly have died already. Farewell, King of Delusion. If only we were born in a time of peace, you might have lived a joyful life as a benevolent ruler."
9010,Dimitri: To the fires of eternity with you...El...
9011,Dedue: Your Majesty... Your Majesty!
9012,Dimitri: Stop calling me that.
9013,"Dedue: Ah, thank the... No..."
9014,Dimitri: Dedue... It seems I will die...before I can get revenge for everyone...
9015,Dedue: ...
9016,"Dimitri: My family, my friends, my home... Everything that truly mattered to me... I couldn't..."
9017,"Dedue: You're wrong! Because of you, I was able to live on until today. You saved me. These past nine years... I am proud to have been at your side. It was a joy I never could have hoped for. Despite all, I count myself a lucky man."
9018,Dimitri: Is that so? I see... I am glad...
9019,"Dedue: You must be weary, Your Majesty. Please...rest in peace."
9020,Church Soldier: Lady Rhea! King Dimitri has fallen in battle! The Kingdom's army has retreated! It is impossible to preserve the front line! (if Seiros was defeated before defeating Dimitri)
9021,Seiros: Gah... Everyone withdraw immediately! Fall back to Fhirdiad! The goddess is watching over us! If we hold strong we will surely be saved!
9022,Church Soldier: Understood! Retreat!
9023,"Seiros: Why do you insist on being such a loathsome obstacle... You stole my mother's heart and wield the Sword of the Creator. Just like that savage King Nemesis... I swear...with these very hands... I will take her back... Until then, wait for me, dear Mother..."
9024,"Edelgard: Rhea... She is our enemy, but I must admit that she plays her cards magnificently."
9025,Hubert: You mean using the goddess's name in order to boost morale?
9026,"Edelgard: That's true, but she also shows great skill in devising her tactics. Using the bewildered Kingdom army as a shield while she and the knights retreated... If they ran all the way back to Fhirdiad, it will be very difficult to pursue them."
9027,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Can we defeat them?
Edelgard: If you're low on confidence, Professor, I'll put an end to this myself. Actually...that's what I'd like to say, but in truth I hope to confront them with you at my side.
Choice 2: Next time, we will end this.
Edelgard: Yes. Together, we'll end this once and for all."
9028,"Choice 1: Can we defeat them?
Edelgard: If you're low on confidence, Professor, I'll put an end to this myself. Actually...that's what I'd like to say, but in truth I hope to confront them with you at my side."

9030,"Choice 2: Next time, we will end this.
Edelgard: Yes. Together, we'll end this once and for all."
9031,"Edelgard: Yes. Together, we'll end this once and for all."
9032,"Edelgard: For all of the lives lost in battle, by our allies and foes alike... And for Dimitri, as well..."
9033,Byleth: For Dimitri?
9034,"Edelgard: Yes. The thirst for revenge that imprisoned him was the result of my uncle's strategy. He believed that I was the cause of everything...and he lost sight of his path as king. There was nothing I could do to save him. And so, the very least I could do was--"
9035,Byleth: Are you crying?
9036,"Edelgard: No. The Edelgard who shed tears died many years ago. Everything that's happened...it's all just part of the ebb and flow of history. The Tragedy of Duscur, our days at the academy, Father's death, and the five years you were gone... After all of that, at long last, we're here at this point in time. I hope you'll stay by my side until the very end. It's time for humanity to take this world back."

"
9040,"After defeating the Kingdom army and King Dimitri on the Tailtean Plains, Imperial forces set their sights on Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital. The final battle against Rhea draws near.
"
9041,"The Imperial army arrives in Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital, only to be confronted by Rhea--who has transformed into the Immaculate One. The Black Eagle Strike Force steels itself for an epic final battle, hoping to soon return Fódlan to its people.
"
9042,"A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. With the fall of Fhirdiad, the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Church of Seiros both vanished into the people's memories. Fódlan was finally one unified nation, under the rule of Emperor Edelgard and the Adrestian Empire. Embracing her newfound power, Edelgard could at last set about destroying Fódlan's entrenched system of nobility and rebuild a world free from the tyranny of Crests and status. Yet beneath the surface, an unseen and silent struggle began to take shape. From her seat of power, Edelgard could at last wage war on those who slither in the dark.
"
9043,"Lord Arundel: So, we have finally arrived. It has been a very, very long road."
9044,"Edelgard: Why are you here, Uncle? We haven't prevailed just yet."
9045,Lord Arundel: Even better. I decided I wanted to see the end with my own eyes. The very moment that humans will finally be free from the control of that false beast of a goddess..
9046,"Edelgard: Understood. Behold to your heart's content, just don't get in our way."
9047,"Lord Arundel: Of course. I could not stand to be dragged into the fighting. When this fight is over, a world completely controlled by the Empire will be upon us."
9048,"Edelgard: Not completely... I will only do what I must. But until our reign becomes stable... Uncle... No, all of you. I believe that your power and knowledge may be essential during that time of transition."
9049,"Lord Arundel: Perhaps so. We also will do what we must. For that short while, we will lend your our strength."
9050,Edelgard: Yes... We're counting on you. For now.
9051,"Edelgard: Professor, may I speak with you?"
9052,Byleth: What's on your mind?
9053,"Edelgard: I know the timing is less than ideal, but there's something I need to tell you. I imagine you've already sensed it, but even still... I must tell you the truth...of the power you wield and of what you are."
9054,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have sensed it too.
Edelgard: I expected as much.
Choice 2: What are you talking about?
Edelgard: Have you still yet to realize it? If so, then it's absolutely vital that I tell you."
9055,"Choice 1: I have sensed it too.
Edelgard: I expected as much."
9056,Edelgard: I expected as much.
9057,"Choice 2: What are you talking about?
Edelgard: Have you still yet to realize it? If so, then it's absolutely vital that I tell you."
9058,"Edelgard: Have you still yet to realize it? If so, then it's absolutely vital that I tell you."
9059,"Edelgard: You, like Rhea, share a bloodline with the so-called goddess. Your mother likely had some connection to the goddess, whose power has always been sleeping within you. Five years ago when your power awakened, I was afraid you would choose to join with Rhea."
9060,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You thought I would join her?
Edelgard: I did.
Choice 2: Five years ago...
Edelgard: Yes. In the Sealed Forest, when you returned from the eternal darkness..."
9061,"Choice 1: You thought I would join her?
Edelgard: I did."
9062,Edelgard: I did.
9063,"Choice 2: Five years ago...
Edelgard: Yes. In the Sealed Forest, when you returned from the eternal darkness..."
9064,"Edelgard: Yes. In the Sealed Forest, when you returned from the eternal darkness..."
9065,"Edelgard: As you know, my goal is to free our world from the control of Rhea and the other children of the goddess. I seek to obliterate her, as well as those around her who use the church's power to control Fódlan. I swore to free the people from Rhea by striking her down, whether or not it meant making an enemy of you. And yet...you came to my aid and chose to walk with me on the path against Rhea. I was overjoyed of course, but I was also confused. I thought that perhaps it wasn't the path you were meant to take. But I chose to trust in you, to rely on you and your strength. And now, here we are."
9066,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I understand...
Edelgard: Thank you for listening, my teacher. I'm glad I finally had the chance to talk to you about it.
Choice 2: Please explain it once more.
Edelgard: Of course... (Loops back to Edelgard saying ""You, like Rhea,..."")"
9067,"Choice 1: I understand...
Edelgard: Thank you for listening, my teacher. I'm glad I finally had the chance to talk to you about it."
9068,"Edelgard: Thank you for listening, my teacher. I'm glad I finally had the chance to talk to you about it."
9069,"Choice 2: Please explain it once more.
Edelgard: Of course... (Loops back to Edelgard saying ""You, like Rhea,..."")"
9070,"Edelgard: Of course... (Loops back to Edelgard saying ""You, like Rhea,..."")"
9071,"Edelgard: After Rhea is gone from this world, I don't know what will become of you. But whatever happens, I hope you know that you're very special to me. I hope that I hold a special place in your heart as well. But regardless... (You are the one person in this world who can share the heavy burden I must carry. Someone without equal who I can always speak my mind to... ) It's time. Let's go, Professor."
9072,"Edelgard: Rhea! Members of the Church of Seiros! Surely there's no reason to continue this fight. What could possibly be gained by shutting yourselves inside the capital of a kingdom without a king? I will give you this one chance...and no other. Throw down your weapons and surrender! Unlike you, I have no desire to unleash wicked atrocities upon this world!"
9073,Hubert: Their silence speaks volumes. Shall we commence our attack?
9074,"Edelgard: I'll wait just a moment longer. There are still many residents within the city. Unlike my attack at Garreg Mach five years ago, the church will not allow the inhabitants to evacuate. What the hell are they planning..."
9075,"Catherine: Lady Rhea...Or rather, Lady Seiros. The Imperial army is calling for our surrender. Is it wise to ignore them? Perhaps we could leave Fódlan and devise another plan..."
9076,"Seiros: We shall not surrender. We must not lose! Even if it must split the heavens, we shall not yield to the wicked ones!"
9077,"Catherine: Understood... I will do as you command. You have my fealty no matter what, until my last moment of life."
9078,Cyril: I'll stay by your side too...forever.
9079,"Seiros: Now, Catherine. Set fire to the city. The Imperial army will burn in the flames of eternal torment!"
9080,"Catherine: What?! No, you can't do that!"
9081,Seiros: Catherine. Now.
9082,Catherine: As...as you wish. But is there truly no other way?
9083,Seiros: I have no patience for foolish questions. I shall sacrifice as many lives as it takes! That apostate who insists on taking everything from me...will by crushed by my own hands!
9084,The Immaculate One: GRAAAARGH!
9085,Edelgard: That ghastly voice...
9086,Imperial Soldier: Your Majesty! There's smoke coming from every corner of the capital! It seems they've set fire to the city!
9087,"Edelgard: What?! Damn it, Rhea. There really is no depth you wouldn't sink into. Everyone, we must commence our attack at once. Are you ready?"
9088,Hubert: Preparations are complete. Just say the word.
9089,"Edelgard: Then we attack. We'll head straight for the castle and strike down their leader--Rhea, that vile creature called the Immaculate One! This is the end of our long war. After this victory, Fódlan will finally be united and truly free! The capital we're about to invade is engulfed in flames. Do not rush to your deaths. Survive. Prevail. Do that and we'll witness the birth of a new world. I want to see it with all of you at my side. Understood?"
9090,"Hubert: Of course. I will not fall and leave you without your protector. That you may live to see your dream to fruition... For that, I shall survive and prevail!"
9091,"Petra: I am carrying the future of Brigid. I will not be dying here! I will be winning. For myself and everyone, I will be surviving!"
9092,"Caspar: We've been cutting our own path this whole way. There's no stopping until we reach the end! I can't die, or all my great work so far will have been wasted!"
9093,"Dorothea: Don't worry about me, Edie. I won't fall before I've found my happily ever after. Maybe when this war is over I can finally snag a good catch and settle down!"
9094,"Linhardt: Somehow we're already here... I wonder if the peace we secure will allow me to research as much as I'd like. If so, let's end this quickly!"
9095,"Bernadetta: Edelgard! Professor! I'll do my best for both of you! If I die here, it would be with shame and regret... Oh, I can't let that happen!"
9096,"Ferdinand: Once the world is united, I will lend my strength to both Edelgard and the Professor. To that end, I will lead us all safely to victory! My pride and duty as a noble demand no less! As do my own principles!"
9097,"Byleth: Let's win this, together!"
9098,Edelgard: Imperial army! Black Eagle Strike Force! Move out!
9099,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
9100,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle."
9101,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
9102,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Edelgard falls in battle.
9103,"Edelgard: At last, we made it to Fhirdiad, but...it's in a pitiful state."
9104,"Caspar: It's so awful to see the Kingdom capital go up in flames, but at least we made it this far!"
9105,Hubert: We finally stand before the palace. Though these flames will our friends and foes alike.
9106,"Edelgard: Those who stand in our way will perish with the flames. Immaculate One...your reign ends, here and now!"
9107,"Catherine: With fire raging all over the city, our enemies won't be able to advance in large numbers. Instead, they may try to defeat us with small squads of elite warriors."
9108,"The Immaculate One: Indeed, I suspect as much. And at their head is the one who stole my mother from me and likely that mutinous whelp, Edelgard."
9109,"Bernadetta: The whole city's burning! oh, this isn't good! I'm flammable, you know!"
9110,"Petra: If possible, we must be avoiding the flame and be careful of strong enemies."
9111,"Hubert: If we want to minimize our losses, we will need to be flexible in our approach."
9112,The Immaculate One: Open your hearts and accept your fate... The immaculate roar saves only the righteous! GRWOAAAAAARRRR!
9113,Linhardt: What? Her howl as unadulterated magic. I didn't know such a display of power was possible.
9114,Ferdinand: That roar seems to have affected the dolls' movements.
9115,"Dorothea: Whenever ""the Immaculate One"" howls, those dolls become stronger."
9116,"Edelgard: Such power resides in the Immaculate One's roar... We must destroy those golems, and quickly!"
9117,Gilbert: I was trusted to protect the future of this nation. The royal bloodline itself! I cannot yield! I will fulfill my duty even if I must forfeit my life!
9118,"Gilbert: I can only lament that you chose to side with the Empire. I am a royal knight, and I will destroy all of His Majesty's foes!"
9119,Gilbert: Annette...I knew this day would come.
9120,"Annette: Yes... And so did I, Father. Be warned that I will push you aside, even if I must use force to do it."
9121,Gilbert: I understand. Goddess...this is surely a chastisement from you.
9122,Gilbert: Majesty... I beg...forgiveness... My promise to you... I...could not...
9123,"Annette: Don't worry, Father... I will protect the capital and the whole Kingdom!"
9124,"Ashe: Our pride, our people, our king. You've torn them all apart. Haven't you had enough?! What else is there for you to take?!"
9125,Ashe: Don't look at me that way. You'll throw off my aim!
9126,"Ashe: I tried...to do the right thing, Lonato..."
9127,Annette: I won't let you take Fhirdiad! I'll defend this place with my very life!
9128,"Annette: Why, Professor? Why must we fight like this? Surely there was another path you could have taken that wouldn't have led to this..."
9129,Annette: Mercie...
9130,"Mercedes: Now now, Annie. There's no need for that. This is a battlefield, after all."
9131,"Annette: I'm so sorry... You know that, don't you? And also know that you don't have to forgive me..."
9132,Mercedes: I was going to say the same thing. I'm so sorry if I cause you any pain.
9133,"Annette: Urgh, it hurts... Help me, Father..."
9134,"Gilbert: Annette! I will avenge you, my daughter. (if not defeated)"
9135,"Catherine: I will pour everything into this blade--my body, my soul. Thunderbrand rumbles, urging me on. I am the goddess's servant. You will taste my blade!"
9136,"Catherine: I wish you'd never shown your face at Garreg Mach. I always knew you were trouble, yet I did nothing. Time for me to correct that mistake. Prepare to meet your end!"
9137,"Shamir: Hello, Catherine. I always knew this day would come."
9138,"Catherine: What a coincidence, so did I. It seems that we now have no choice. We have nothing in common. Not our backgrounds, not our beliefs."
9139,Shamir: Not the way we lived...or the way we die.
9140,Catherine: Lady Rhea... My service ends here. It's been an honor.
9141,Cyril: Get away from Lady Rhea!
9142,Cyril: You made Lady Rhea hurt! I'll never forgive you!
9143,"Cyril: Lady Rhea, thank you...for everything..."
9144,The Immaculate One: I see the years have not cured humanity of its folly... You still wish to hurt and betray my mother and myself!
9145,The Immaculate One: Give her back... Give back my mother! Gaaaaaah!
9146,"Edelgard: So it's true. You don't value human life at all. Isn't that right, Immaculate One?"
9147,"The Immaculate One: Nonsense! Fools who do not accept their own sins are undeserving of salvation! You humans are the ones who betrayed! You betrayed me, and you betrayed my mother!"
9148,Edelgard: I did not betray you or her. I never believed in you from the beginning.
9149,The Immaculate One: Give it back!
9150,Edelgard: When humanity stands strong and people reach out for each other...there's no need for gods. Rhea. Your reign of tyranny is over.
9151,Edelgard: The time has come.
9152,Edelgard: I'm ending this once and for all!
9153,Edelgard: Is it...is it over?

9155,"Together, the people of Fódlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends. They recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike, but each person must still walk their chosen path alone. With each day, the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky. A silent reminder, perhaps, of some inescapable truth…

9199,"In Imperial Year 1181, the New Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial Army. But amidst the chaos of battle, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of Fódlan has begun.
"
9200,Rhea: Unforgivable! I cannot believe that the Adrestian Empire would embark on such a violent course of action.
9201,Seteth: The fault is my own. I failed to see the wickedness within Edelgard's heart.
9202,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?
Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
9203,"Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
9204,"Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
9205,"Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
9206,"Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
9207,Seteth: Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know. Perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the Church of Seiros...
9208,Rhea: Adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle. To injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten. We must stop the Empire...and quickly.
9209,"Shamir: I have returned, Rhea."
9210,"Rhea: Welcome back, Shamir. Were you able to discern the Empire's movements?"
9211,Shamir: Their main troops are marching towards Garreg Mach. It is said that they will join forces with Edelgard's army and arrive within two weeks.
9212,Seteth: Two weeks? That is not enough time! It will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then. We must send notice to all surrounding villages at once. We must order the residents of Garreg Mach to flee for their lives.
9213,Shamir: It will be done.
9214,"Rhea: …Professor…listen closely. If our enemy invades the monastery, I will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield. If something happens to me...I am entrusting my sacred duties to you."
9215,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why me?
Choice 2: Sacred duties?"
9216,Choice 1: Why me?
9217,Choice 2: Sacred duties?
9218,"Rhea: You must have guessed it by now. The truth of who you are. Or perhaps I should say, your lost memories are surely beginning to return. I have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you. But the duty is yours and yours alone. Only you can lead the people of Fódlan."
9219,"Seteth: …Rhea, please. You must tell me all that you know. I beg of you."
9220,Rhea: …
9221,Seteth: That one…is the progenitor god. Am I correct?
9222,"Rhea: In a sense. Our dear professor is…a vessel. One who carries the power of the progenitor god within. In time, the vessel will become one with the power contained within, and the progenitor god shall return to this world."
9223,Seteth: I see. I trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment? But I suppose there is no turning back…
9224,"Rhea: I ask that you help our friend…and in doing so, help her. I am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more."
9225,"Seteth: I am sorry, but I cannot do this. I am not certain it is just…"
9226,Rhea: I see. That is a shame.
9227,"Seteth: I understand. As ever, I will take you at your word."
9228,"Flayn: Lady Rhea, Brother, I will do my part as well!"
9229,"Seteth: Flayn! Were you eavesdropping? Regardless, I am glad to hear it. You owe your life to the professor, after all. And in the end, they may prove to be our brethren."
9230,"Rhea: You have my gratitude, Seteth. And you as well, Flayn. As followers of the progenitor god, it is up to us to see our mission through."
9231,Byleth: …
9232,Dimitri: … I'll have that girl's head. Just you wait…
9233,"Claude: The Empire is moving quickly. Edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now. If you really think about it, she must have been planning for this even before you got the Sword of the Creator… Of course she was always a step ahead of us. We were blinded by the ball and the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, and everything else…"
9234,"Ferdinand: Half of the Empire's six great noble families have declared their support for Edelgard. Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard. And my father…he was stripped of his role as prime minister. As as result, House Aegir has lost all of its power, all of its land. We have lost everything. I…I… What do I do?"
9235,"Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing..."
9236,"Caspar: I don't normally have a problem jumping into a fight, but it feels strange going up against my father. We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! I hope he's not part of the group coming to attack Garreg Mach..."
9237,"Bernadetta: What does war with Edelgard mean for us, Professor? And why does she even want that?"
9238,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her.
Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that..."
9239,"Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
9240,"Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
9241,"Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that..."
9242,Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that...
9243,"That's how it always goes, I guess. You never realize something can't be undone until you've done it."
9244,"Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win..."
9245,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Us or her, you mean? (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: You're really worried about Edelgard, aren't you, Professor?
Choice 2: We will not lose.
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out..."
9246,"Choice 1: Us or her, you mean? (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: You're really worried about Edelgard, aren't you, Professor?"
9247,"Dorothea: You're really worried about Edelgard, aren't you, Professor?"
9248,"Choice 2: We will not lose.
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out..."
9249,"Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out..."
9250,"Petra: I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision...no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead."
9251,"Dedue: His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard. For me, that is cause enough to fight."
9252,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why would Dimitri say that?
Dedue: His Highness would not say. But I can think of only one explanation. She must have been involved in the Tragedy of Duscur.
Choice 2: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
Choice 3: You're truly all right with that? (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant."
9253,"Choice 1: Why would Dimitri say that?
Dedue: His Highness would not say. But I can think of only one explanation. She must have been involved in the Tragedy of Duscur."
9254,Dedue: His Highness would not say. But I can think of only one explanation. She must have been involved in the Tragedy of Duscur.
9255,"Choice 2: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now."
9256,Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
9257,"Choice 3: You're truly all right with that? (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant."
9258,Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant.
9259,"Dedue: And if Edelgard was responsible in any way for the Tragedy of Duscur, that is something I cannot ignore. If that is the case, then she is my enemy."
9260,"Felix: That girl's starting an all-out war, isn't she? But an enemy is an enemy, no matter who they are. Don't let compassion for her get in your way."
9261,"Annette: Once the Imperial army reaches the monastery, we'll have no choice but to fight..."
9262,Ashe: What's going to happen to us?
9263,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Everything will be all right. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!
Choice 2: I can't say for sure.
Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
9264,"Choice 1: Everything will be all right. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!"
9265,"Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!"
9266,"Choice 2: I can't say for sure.
Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
9267,"Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
9268,Sylvain: Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it. Why did Edelgard make enemies with the nobles?
9269,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have no idea.
Sylvain: Me either.... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it? (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Choice 2: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
9270,"Choice 1: I have no idea.
Sylvain: Me either.... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it? (Relationship with Sylvain up)"
9271,"Sylvain: Me either.... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it? (Relationship with Sylvain up)"
9272,"Choice 2: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
9273,"Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
9274,"Mercedes: I guess we have no choice but to fight, have we? Oh, but why would Edelgard do something like this? I'm sure we'll be all right though, Professor. The goddess will keep us safe."
9275,"Ingrid: To think that the Flame Emperor was Edelgard all along... Flayn's abduction, Jeralt's murder, the turmoil in Remire Village... Whether or not she was the mastermind behind what happened, it at least seems like she was involved. And yet she was able to remain so composed while she was enrolled in the Officer's Academy."
9276,"Lorenz: The Empire's aggression cannot stand. But if we are going to attack them now, we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success. It goes without saying that I will fight the Imperial army with everything I have, for as long as I am able. But House Gloucester's territory is adjacent to Imperial lands. Let us proceed with caution."
9277,"Raphael: I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys! If the Alliance is in danger, that means my sister's in danger too! There's no way I'm gonna allow that. It doesn't matter how many guys they throw at us, I'll beat 'em all! These muscles aren't just for show! But first, I gotta get some food."
9278,"Ignatz: You know, Professor, I'm glad that I came to the Officers Academy. I feel accepted here. I've learned so much. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much I've grown. So, I will not let the academy be destroyed. It's important to me, and I will protect it!"
9279,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor.
Choice 2: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
9280,"Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)

9283,"Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
9284,"Ignatz: We're gonna win this, Professor!"
9285,"Lysithea: So Edelgard, the one who calls herself the Flame Emperor, was connected to those strange beings. The Imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know. You had better be cautious, Professor. Any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing."
9286,"Marianne: Can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs? I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I..."
9287,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?
Choice 2: We can't win if you run. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!"
9288,"Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?"

9290,"Choice 2: We can't win if you run. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!"
9291,Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!
9292,"Hilda: You'll battle Edelgard, right? Good luck! Me? Oh, I'm going to run away. I have zero interest in dying here, thank you very much."
9293,"Hilda: At times like this, I just feel so anxious, you know? But you'll watch out for me there. Right, Professor?"
9294,Leonie: What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it.
9295,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept."
9296,Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
9297,Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept.
9298,"Leonie: I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you."
9299,"Rhea: How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side. Please try to listen carefully for her voice..."
9300,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I will try. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Choice 2: I can't hear a thing.

Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time."
9303,Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time.
9304,Rhea: May the goddess's voice reach you…
9305,Seteth: We must protect Garreg Mach. Defiling the Holy Tomb was a sacrilege. I will not allow such a thing to happen again. The archbishop has already given you a new responsibility. I want you to rise to that honor.
9306,"Flayn: Professor… War is breaking out again, is it not?"
9307,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time.
Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?"
9308,"Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
9309,"Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
9310,"Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.

9311,Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?
9312,Flayn: I never wanted another war… All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead.
9313,"Alois: Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle. We're depending on your strength, Professor. Crush our enemies!"
9314,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'll try
Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)"
9315,Choice 1: I'll try
9316,Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)
9317,"Alois: Captain, I hope you're watching! We will protect Garreg Mach!"
9318,"Catherine: Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's..."
9319,"Shamir: We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor. To think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses... However hard we fight, I give us a 50 percent chance of winning. The enemy has too many advantages. We must make careful preparations."
9320,"Gilbert: There are always small power struggles, still... It has been hundreds of years since all of Fódlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this... I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should... Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland... To the land of my king."
9321,"Hanneman: The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place… But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet… I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well… And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts… Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!"
9322,"Manuela: The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess… Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe…"
9323,"Cyril: It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all…"
9324,"Gatekeeper: Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive… Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!"
9325,"Knight of Seiros: I cannot believe our negligence allowed the Empire to invade. Edelgard probably gathered her soldiers in Garreg Mach, intending to do this from the start. Soldiers disguised as merchants and pilgrims to avoid suspicion…infiltration the entire area little by little. They couldn't be better prepared. We'll have a tough time winning this one, I'm afraid."
9326,Student: Professor! What actually happened last month? I can't keep up at all. Edelgard is the emperor? And she's declared war against the church? So now we're at war?! WHAT is going on? I really don't understand any of this… What should I do?
9327,"Student: I thought we'd all be really busy with assignments and getting ready for graduation. But now… Now that things have turned out like this, I guess there's nothing to do but fight…"
9328,Monk: Those who serve the church must cast aside all selfish desires and devote themselves fully to their beliefs. But is it right to wield piety as a weapon? I…have never considered such things before. The church… I… I have always done what I thought best to save the people of Fódlan…
9329,"Monk: How dare they threaten the goddess! Such a vile act cannot be forgiven! There is no need to worry, I promise you that. Divine punishment will surely fall upon them. In the days of yore, the goddess would grow angry with such insolent fools and roast them in Ailell…"
9330,"Yuri: So this is how it's turned out. I figured as much, but I didn't anticipate it would happen so soon. If Garreg Mach becomes a battlefield, Abyss will have no choice but to get involved. Everyone here will have no alternative. They've got nowhere else to go."
9331,"Balthus: I could smell a war brewing, and sure enough, here we are. Hmm... If Fódlan falls onto chaos, I wonder if my debts will fall away along with it... Heh, just thinking aloud here. If the Empire wants a fight, let's give 'em one to remember!"
9332,"It shakes me to my core that the Empire would lash out so violently. I shall have to reconsider my intended path towards restoring House Nuvelle. Still, I could not in good conscience fight without speaking to her first..."
9333,"Hapi: Lots of people in Abyss are already struggling to get by. War will make things even harder for us. We're sure to run out of food and other supplies, and there will probably be refugees to take care of. Not to mention what might happen if the Empire takes over and decides to redecorate."
9334,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Aww, guess who was worried about Abyss and came by to check on me. I mean, on us. Isn't that nice? That's just...so nice."
9335,Knight of Seiros: My pleasure. Surely the church can spare one knight to help you watch over this place.
9336,"Abysskeeper: I'm not crying! I'm just...just don't worry about it, OK?! Move it along!"
9337,"Seteth: We have been scouting the makeup of the Imperial army, but much is still unclear. Any information you could provide would be a great help"
9338,"Seteth: Interesting… It's true that a lot more people have been coming and going as of late. Hmm, perhaps we could secure new information if we capture someone from the Imperial army. Thank you. That is quite helpful."
9339,"Alois: Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us. If you can fight, pick up a weapon! Everyone else, hurry up and evacuate! We have the goddess's protection on our side. We have nothing to fear. Victory will be ours!"
9340,"Catherine: Professor, are you ready?"
9341,Byleth: Almost.
9342,"Catherine: Well, hurry up. I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard. Do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are."
9343,"Linhardt: Of course we know, but we can't let her get away. Also, please cease your unwarranted glaring. We don't deserve your judgement."
9344,Ferdinand: My father was removed from his role as prime minister and is still under house arrest in the Imperial capital. As his successor...it is my duty to stop her!
9345,Caspar: The way she's going about all of this is wrong. It's up to us to help her realize that!
9346,"Bernadetta: I won't be following her, but...l won't run away either!"
9347,Dorothea: Edie's going to come at us with all she's got. And that's a lot. That means we need to fight her with all of our might too.
9348,"Petra: She is one who has strength, that has certainty. But we have strength also. We will not be losing!"
9349,Flayn: I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!
9350,"Catherine: You students really have guts, don't you? Though, I suppose I can't call you students anymore. You're now part of our order. You have our support and our gratitude. Professor, I'm counting on you. Go ahead and take the lead."
9351,"Byleth
Choice 1: Leave it to me.
Choice 2: I'll protect the students."
9352,Choice 1: Leave it to me.
9353,Choice 2: I'll protect the students.
9354,"Catherine: These kids...they look up to you. I guess that goes without saying. Just look in their eyes and you can see it. If we all make it through this, let's meet again. Good luck out there!"
9355,Suggested Level: 23
9356,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
9357,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth falls in battle (classic mode), all of your units fall in battle (casual mode), Rhea falls in battle, or the defended location is captured."
9358,Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The enemy is within the walls. They're about to break the defensive line!
9359,"Seteth: Knights, soldiers, students! Defend the front line and the archbishop with your lives until help arrives! Reinforcements are on the way! Hold fast!"
9360,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading!
9361,Seteth: That won't do - the strongholds to the east and west are our rally points for reinforcements. Retake them at once!
9362,"Seteth: Alright, that's one stronghold recaptured. Now, the other!"
9363,Seteth: That's both strongholds! It appears we were right on time.
9364,Seteth: No–the monestary has fallen! We've been defeated...
9365,Rhea: The goddess protects us... what is there to fear rebel swords... This is blasphemy against the goddess! Stop this now!
9366,Rhea: N-no... I cannot fall here...
9367,Randolph: A wonderful chance to earn some recognition! I'll be the one to take down the monastery!
9368,Caspar: Huh. This guy seems real familiar…
9369,Randolph: Y-you dastard! Aren't you… No…
9370,"Caspar: Eh, that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!"
9371,Randolph: I have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight!
9372,"Randolph: Argh! I'm finished. I loathe to say it, but I must retreat..."
9373,Hubert: Lady Edelgard held you in such high esteem.
9374,"Hubert: In the end, however, it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess."
9375,"Hubert: Such a shame. There are people in the Empire you truly care about, too, aren't there? I wonder what will become of them."
9376,"Hubert: What you fail to appreciate is that we have, at our backs, a force you cannot hope to defeat."
9377,Hubert: I can afford to fall back. We still have the advantage.
9378,Death Knight: This battlefield is too chaotic... for us to kill each other upon…
9379,Death Knight: This fight is but a sideshow… to the ravaging of the sacred place that is Garreg Mach…
9380,Death Knight: The time is not right... I will wait for the next opportunity…
9381,Ladislava: I will not allow you to get any closer to Her Majesty!
9382,"Ladislava: My life was changed forever by Her Majesty... Now, I lay it on the line. For the Empire!"
9383,"Ladislava: Lady Edelgard, I'm so sorry! I can't keep going! I must retreat!"
9384,"Edelgard: I wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds. If it were so, I would have done anything to make you my ally…"
9385,"Edelgard: So, House Nuvelle has chosen the path that will lead to its ultimate demise. How pitiable."
9386,"Constance: As you say, I have forfeited my claim on being a noble of the Empire. That is why you must permit me to challenge you in combat, so that I may establish a new House Nuvelle."
9387,Edelgard: As you wish. Let's see if your resolve is a match for my own.
9388,"Edelgard: Think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the Empire... or if you will offer it to us in fealty. And after you've thought it through, if you still wish to fight, I won't stop you. I will simply use the full extent of my power… and crush you."
9389,Edelgard: You will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the Adrestian Empire!
9390,"Edelgard: You fought well. But now, your fight is over. Send in our reserve troops, and give my uncle the signal!"
9391,Rhea: What… is this?!
9392,"Rhea: Everyone here, young and old, is in your hands."
9393,Rhea: No. I will not allow another Red Canyon tragedy to happen here.
9394,Claude: What is going on?
9395,Empire Soldier: What now?

9400,"It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of Fódlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factions–those who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgard’s rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new Fódlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

9404,"In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former Kingdom–Houses Gautier and Fraldarius–struggle to continue the resistance. Cornelia–operating out of the royal palace–has accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.
"
9405,"In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empire’s supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Alliance’s adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.
"
9406,"In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western Fódlan.
"
9407,"In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin…and become a haven for thieves.

Choice 1: It's been a long time. (waves to Seteth)
Seteth: Yes, it has been! But this is no time for casual chatter!
Choice 2: What are you doing here?
Seteth: I was going to ask you the very same thing."

Seteth: I was going to ask you the very same thing."
9469,Seteth: I was going to ask you the very same thing.
9470,"Seteth: After you disappeared five years ago, do you have any idea how dire the church's situation became? Where were you, and what were you doing all of those years?"
9471,Byleth: I was sleeping.
9472,"Seteth: You slept for five years... In that case, I suppose there is nothing more to say. You should know that Rhea also disappeared after the battle at Garreg Mach five years ago. Since then, the knights have been fully devoted to searching for her. They have yet to find a trace."
9473,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Was she captured by the Imperial army?
Choice 2: Was she murdered by the Imperial army?"
9474,Choice 1: Was she captured by the Imperial army?
9475,Choice 2: Was she murdered by the Imperial army?
9476,"Seteth: It is possible. However, the Empire has not made any such statement as of yet. Even if that were the truth, there is no way for us to confirm. We have searched all over, but we have reached an impasse. Unless we do something, our efforts to find Rhea and rebuild the Church will be stalled indefinitely. Our opportunity to strike back is close at hand. Sadly, we are short on military strength. However, now we have you. Do you recall what Rhea told you five years ago? She asked for you to take her place should anything ever happen to her. She entrusted you with leading the people of Fódlan."
9477,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I remember.
Seteth: Then I beg of you, please, heed her words.
Choice 2: I can't do that.
Seteth: I will not accept that. Please... you must lend me your strength."
9478,"Choice 1: I remember.
Seteth: Then I beg of you, please, heed her words."
9479,"Seteth: Then I beg of you, please, heed her words."
9480,"Choice 2: I can't do that.
Seteth: I will not accept that. Please... you must lend me your strength."
9481,Seteth: I will not accept that. Please... you must lend me your strength.
9482,"Seteth: It is up to you to lead us and to defeat the Empire-- no, to defeat Edelgard."
9483,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why me?
Seteth: There is a very good reason...but it is not yet time to divulge it. Just know that without you, we have no hope.
Choice 2: You should lead them.
Seteth: It is not for me to do. You are the only one who can rise to this task. Someday, you will know why that is. Until then, I ask that you trust me.
Choice 3: I don't want to fight Edelgard.
Seteth: What are you saying? She is tormenting all of Fódlan! And you are the only one who can save us! How can you not see that?!"
9484,"Choice 1: Why me?
Seteth: There is a very good reason...but it is not yet time to divulge it. Just know that without you, we have no hope."

9490,"Church Soldier: Sir! Bandits have entered the area! They stole some hidden weapons and ran off! They're heading for the town, so that might be where they're hiding out..."
9491,"Seteth: Vile thieves! Even with the knights gone, I cannot believe they would dare trespass here! This is unforgivable! Come, Professor. Let us give chase!"

9497,Pallardó: What the… Intruders! Protect the goods!
9498,Seteth: Stop the thieves! Retrieve our stolen goods!
9499,Dorothea: We had no place to go so we came back to Garreg Mach. But then -- Huh? Professor?
9500,Caspar: Looks like there's a fight! I'm ready to join the battle!
9501,Petra: It is confirmed that Professor is alive. I will be...cooperating.
9502,"Seteth: What are you doing here?! Never mind, we'll have to talk later! Help us with these thieves!"
9503,"Bernadetta: People? A battle?! Oh, there wasn't supposed to be anyone here! Wait, is that... Professor?!"
9504,"Linhardt: Professor... You're alive after all. Well then, I am quite pleased with my choice to come here."
9505,Ferdinand: Professor?! Never mind... We have to focus on winning this fight!
9506,Seteth: Lend us a hand! Let's beat them back!
9507,"Seteth: If we split our troops in two, we can attack from the north and the south to trap their leader."
9508,"Dorothea: Do you remember our promise from five years ago, Professor? Today's the day."
9509,"Caspar: I'm so glad I get to see you again, Professor!"
9510,Petra: I went back to Brigid once...but I had to be returning to Fódlan. (Relationship with Petra up)
9511,"Ferdinand: Ah, Professor. You have not changed a bit. I am so glad to fight alongside you again."
9512,"Linhardt: So what have you been doing these past five years? Sleeping?! Why, I must say I'm a bit envious."
9513,"Bernadetta: Took all my will to come out here today. But seeing you again, Professor? That's worth a little torture! (Relationship with Bernadetta up)"
9514,Pallardó: No! I'm not the one you want! Gah! I guess I've got no choice.
9515,Pallardó: It isn't looking good for us. Should we retreat?
9516,Seteth: He has some treasure from the monastery too! Do not let him escape!
9517,"Pallardó: Ah, you should yield me a tidy profit!"
9518,Pallardó: I have no longer any reason to be here. Good-bye and be well!
9519,Seteth: Blast -- he got away! We will surely regret failing to recover that treasure...
9520,Pallardó: I thought it would be easy money… Maybe it wasn't…meant to be…
9521,Seteth: That man used to be a merchant here at the monastery. He must have fallen on hard times to take up with those thieves...
9522,Seteth: It seems we were able to expel the bandits who were hiding in Garreg Mach. How fortuitous that you students should gather at the monastery like this...
9523,Dorothea: We made a promise with the professor. That was five years ago to the very day.
9524,Petra: We all gave our promise to be meeting here when the millennium festival arrived.
9525,"Linhardt: Though the one who came up with that plan is not here... Edelgard. Still, how incredible that those present gathered despite the terrible state of things..."
9526,"Caspar: Pfft, the most incredible part of it is that you didn't oversleep and miss the reunion!"
9527,"Seteth: So, that is the reason... Professor. The monastery is safe because of your devoted students. I am now fully convinced you are the only one who can save Fódlan."
9528,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's taking it a bit far.
Seteth: No, not so.
Choice 2: You can count on me.
Seteth: Ah, so you have finally accepted your destiny."
9529,"Choice 1: That's taking it a bit far.
Seteth: No, not so."
9530,"Seteth: No, not so."
9531,"Choice 2: You can count on me.
Seteth: Ah, so you have finally accepted your destiny."
9532,"Seteth: Ah, so you have finally accepted your destiny."
9533,Byleth: What's your reason for being here?
9534,"Seteth: Actually... Well, it would be easier to just show you. Come with me to the Holy Mausoleum. I realize that since you have been slumbering for so long, you have no idea what has transpired in the various territories. Allow me to explain... After the Battle of Garreg Mach, there was a change of regime in the Kingdom. House Blaiddyd suffered a series of brutal massacres, which claimed the lives of Dimitri and Regent Rufus. The Kingdom capital fell and was absorbed into the Empire as the Faerghus Dukedom, which is now under Cornelia's control. Some still resist the Empire. As of now, Rodrigue of House Fraldarius is at the center of such efforts. In the Alliance, Claude leads the faction that opposes the Empire, and Lorenz leads those who have sided with them. The front lines are ever in motion, but the war effort has stagnated overall. In short, both the Kingdom and the Alliance have been swallowed up by the Empire and are on the verge of collapse. We must gather our generals and soldiers under your command and reverse this dire situation."
9535,"Seteth: Flayn, look! The professor has returned to us!"
9536,"Flayn: Hm? What do you mean... Oh! Goodness! It really IS you, Professor! I cannot believe you are still of this world! We were so worried we would never see you again."
9537,Byleth: What are you doing here?
9538,"Flayn: I forgot something important at the Holy Mausoleum... I told my brother I had to go back for it no matter what, and so here I am..."
9539,"Seteth: After we finished here, we were going to continue our search for Rhea. But now that you are here, things have changed. We must not waste this opportunity. We shall send word to the knights scattered all across the land. The time has come for the Knights of Serios to return to action. We are counting on you, Professor!"

9591,"Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor."
9592,"Hanneman: Seteth has told us everything. From here on out, you will have our aid."
9593,"Seteth: I am so grateful that everyone is safe. I am sorry things are moving so rapidly, but there is something we must discuss. Come with me."
9594,Seteth: The time has come to make our true stand against the Empire.
9595,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's win, no matter what.
Choice 2: Let's all work together. (Relationship with Flayn up)

9599,"Seteth: Our base will be Garreg Mach Monastery. The interior is in less than pristine condition, but we should be able to utilize it much the same as we had before."
9600,"Catherine: Surely those Imperial jerks have this place staked out, right? It's a highly strategic location."
9601,"Seteth: It may be an area of importance, but it is far removed from the front lines. Considering the burden of transport, it is possible they are not paying too much attention to it."
9602,Shamir: Nothing escapes the emperor. There must be at least a spy or two.
9603,"Flayn: Professor, what do you think?"

9609,"Seteth: The town and surrounding hamlets are still present, and though far from abundant, the church still has funds at its disposal."
9610,"Flayn: That's true... Professor, I think we can leave expanding our army to my brother. He was always good at negotiating, and I believe he is best suited to the task."
9611,"Ferdinand: In that case, I have a request. Please allow my soldiers to join your ranks as well. House Aegir already tried taking on the emperor. As a result, our territory was stolen from us. As a consequence, I do not have many soldiers left to speak of. But those I have are yours to command."
9612,"Dorothea: I feel like I should tell you that I've been protecting some kids who lost their parents in the war. They're in the town right now, but maybe we can move them to the monastery? I'm sure they'd be happy to chip in however they can."
9613,"Seteth: Hm... Yes, I understand. I will make the necessary arrangements."
9614,"Linhardt: I nabbed some valuables from my house. Father is with the emperor now, so... It's not much, but it's yours."

9616,"Caspar: I've been wandering on my own for five years. I won't go back to that house or my father, that's for sure!"
9617,Seteth: I understand. Leave it to me. No labor is too great if it means saving Fódlan...
9618,"Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more that a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?"

9624,"Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon."
9625,"Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance. Then I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!"
9626,"Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?"
9627,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!

9633,"Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty."

9640,"Sylvain: I left home without telling my father. Did you know that? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. Kind of a scary image, actually. But regardless, I've put my faith in you, Professor. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake."
9641,"Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a while. It's really good to see you again. Gorgeous as ever, might I add. An awful lot has happened in these past five years. There were so many times I wished you were around. I'm glad you're back. Your skills are worth more than a whole army."
9642,"Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away."

9650,"Ingrid: Professor, I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros--instead, uniting with allies from all across Fódlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly... Well..."
9651,"Raphael: Fighting alongside you and everyone else is a dream come true, Professor! And don't worry about my little sis. Right now she's back home helping out with the family business. I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you guys, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!"
9652,"Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but its battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history...would end up like this.

Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So, do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back."
9667,"Seteth: With the return of its knights, Garreg Mach is finally coming back to life. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea."

9674,"Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail."
9675,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Choice 2: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"

9679,"Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
9680,"Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your while demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though, I suppose I haven't changed either right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun."
9681,"Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!"
9682,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain, to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Choice 2: Right, the promise. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!"
9683,"Choice 1: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain, to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold..."

9687,"Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea."
9688,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's fine. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Choice 2: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
9689,"Choice 1: That's fine. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor."
9690,"Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor."

Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
9692,"Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
9693,Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.
9694,"Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta."
9695,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
9696,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again. I promise you that! even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!"
9697,"Soldier: I come from the Empire, but I have no intention of ever returning. This war the emperor instigated has caused nothing but trouble and pain. I want this war to end... And that's why I'm here, fighting with you!"
9698,"Knight of Seiros: During his search for Her Grace, the archbishop, Seteth has visited churches all across the land. It served to demonstrate to the devout across Fódlan that the Church of Seiros is still going strong. As a result, the faithful are not currently in a state of chaos."
9699,"Knight of Seiros: It seems that in the last five years, the monks here have left this place for the town below. However, once they learn of our return, perhaps they'll come back. I hope the monastery can return to normal some day..."
9700,Boy: The town I'd been living in came under attack by the Empire's army... My parents were both caught up in the fighting and killed. I've got no home to go back to anymore... So I guess I may as well stay here.
9701,"Yuri: Well, hello. It's been a while, hasn't it? Are you really so surprised to see me here? I flew here just as soon as I heard you were alive. I care more than you may realize."
9702,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm happy you came. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make my heart flutter a bit.
Choice 2: There's much to be done. Let's work together.
Yuri: Yes. Let's."
9703,"Choice 1: I'm happy you came. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make my heart flutter a bit."

Yuri: Yes. Let's."
9706,Yuri: Yes. Let's.
9707,"Yuri: So long as our efforts are aligned, I'll happily work alongside you."
9708,"Balthus: These past five years have been so chaotic, even the bounty hunters backed off. I kinda miss the chase. I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal."
9709,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and I'll smash it up for ya.
Choice 2: I'm not sure about your motivation...
Balthus: By that, you mean, ""Thank you, Magnanimous King of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome."
9710,"Choice 1: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and I'll smash it up for ya."

9713,"Balthus: By that, you mean, ""Thank you, Magnanimous King of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome."
9714,"Balthus: If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse, think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp."
9715,"Constance: Ahaha! You have the look of someone relieved to see me. Before you ask, yes. My superior spellcraft is yours. It's your reward for waiting so patiently for me."
9716,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you sure?
Constance: I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough. I recommend that you accept my generous offer.
Choice 2: It would help me a lot. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying."
9717,"Choice 1: Are you sure?
Constance: I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough. I recommend that you accept my generous offer."
9718,"Constance: I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough. I recommend that you accept my generous offer."

Constance: Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying."
9720,Constance: Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying.
9721,Constance: But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.
9722,"Hapi: You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long. I thought you might have died. But I didn't have anywhere else to go, so...I stayed here."
9723,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
9724,"Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you."
9725,Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
9726,"Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
9727,Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy.
9728,"Hapi: I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed, we've lost a few people down here."
9729,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years, hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard. That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be. Looks like the Knights of Seiros have returned. I wonder if Mr. Backup is back too..."
9730,Rogue: A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started. People are saying it was the church that used to keep order around here. But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.
9731,"Seteth: We are working to acquire more resources, and would greatly appreciate your help."
9732,"Seteth: Your assistance in collecting resources is most appreciated. It may not be much, but please accept this with my thanks."
9733,"Merchant: I want to start a collection that chronicles the history of Fódlan, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on anything significant. Honestly, it might be easier to excavate an artifact rather than trying to find one for sale..."
9734,"Merchant: Ah, magnificent! Exactly what I was looking for. Clearly I asked the right person for help."
9735,"Soldier: Recently, pirates have been raiding coastal towns in the Sreng Region. People say that they're attacking innocent civilians and sinking merchant ships. Think you can do something about that?"
9736,Soldier: Nice work out there! Some mercenaries heard news of your valiant leadership and have come to the monastery to offer their services.
9737,Soldier: Some soldiers stationed at Fódlan's Locket abandoned their posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks. It would be a real headache for us if they became bandits and started wreaking havoc in the towns.
9738,"Soldier: I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those Fódlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little intervention, they've changed their tune and are back on our side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line."
9739,"Soldier: The fish seem skittish lately... It's said that every five years, in the wake of a storm, a mystery fish appears and eats up all of the other fish in the pond. They call it the Big One. I thought that it was just a legend though."
9740,"Soldier: You got rid of the Big One! Now the other fish can rest easy. Assuming fish rest... Anyway, nice work."
9741,Balthus: It seems some villages out near Fódlan's Throat have been having some trouble with thieves lately. Holst asked for help dealing with the problem. You mind coming along?
9742,"Balthus: Sorry for dragging you along on that, pal. But hey, would you like to meet Holst sometime? I think he's really interested in you. Maybe we all can meet up the next time we're in his neck of the woods?"
9743,"Seteth: Your attention, everyone. The Knights of Seiros and our most trusted allies have gathered. We have rallied our troops for the purpose of stopping the Adrestian Empire's efforts to rule all. We have prepared a new flag to fight under..."
9744,(A flag bearing the Crest of Flames is shown)
9745,"Seteth: Much like the professor, it bears the Crest of Flames. I hope everyone finds this suitable. Beneath this flag, we will bring back peace to the great land of Fódlan!"
9746,(crowd cheers in agreement)
9747,"Flayn: Professor, I'm not sure I understand... Why is the Empire intent on making an enemy of the church?"
9748,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't understand either.
Flayn: Quite perplexing... If the church disappears from Fódlan, I wonder if the Empire thinks it will benefit them in some way? I feel, I feel that it will only confuse the people.
Choice 2: They must oppose the way of the church.
Flayn: What is meant by ""the way of the church""? What do they dislike about it?"
9749,"Choice 1: I don't understand either.
Flayn: Quite perplexing... If the church disappears from Fódlan, I wonder if the Empire thinks it will benefit them in some way? I feel, I feel that it will only confuse the people."
9750,"Flayn: Quite perplexing... If the church disappears from Fódlan, I wonder if the Empire thinks it will benefit them in some way? I feel, I feel that it will only confuse the people."
9751,"Choice 2: They must oppose the way of the church.
Flayn: What is meant by ""the way of the church""? What do they dislike about it?"
9752,"Flayn: What is meant by ""the way of the church""? What do they dislike about it?"
9753,"Seteth: I have no idea what Edelgard was thinking or how she arrived at the decision to raise an army. However, I do have some small insight as to what she is after. She is attempting to destroy the existing social order. That is why the Church of Seiros is first on the list of institutions that must be destroyed. It may very well be her goal to rebuild Fódlan from the ground up..."
9754,"Flayn: I see... But that is only Edelgard's desire, is it not? I cannot imagine that the people of Fódlan would want that for themselves. She may have high ideals, but she certainly lacks any compunction about throwing the world, and its people, into an awful war... It just seems so illogical!"
9755,"Seteth: You have a point, Flayn. I do not believe the people will ever understand her aim. So long as she makes the people suffer, our Knights of Seiros will fight on and strive to protect them. If we do not defeat Edelgard and retake control of this world, Fódlan's future shall be as dark as night."
9756,"Flayn: Thank you, dear Brother. I finally feel I understand what is going on."
9757,"Seteth: I am always happy to answer your questions, Flayn. Is there anything else you wish to ask?"
9758,"Flayn: Well, um... Actually, I have a question for the professor. My brother mentioned that...you slumbered for five years. Where was it that you slept?"
9759,"Byleth:
Choice 1: At the bottom of a valley.
Flayn: The bottom of a valley? In the water? That certainly sounds frigid! I would never choose such a place myself. I am surprised you did not fall ill.
Choice 2: Under a rock.
Flayn: Under a rock... How similar we are! As it were, I took my rest in a casket made of stone.
(Choice 3) I don't know.
Flayn: Oh. Well, I suppose one's first long slumber is difficult to recall..."
9760,"Choice 1: At the bottom of a valley.
Flayn: The bottom of a valley? In the water? That certainly sounds frigid! I would never choose such a place myself. I am surprised you did not fall ill."
9761,Flayn: The bottom of a valley? In the water? That certainly sounds frigid! I would never choose such a place myself. I am surprised you did not fall ill.
9762,"Choice 2: Under a rock.
Flayn: Under a rock... How similar we are! As it were, I took my rest in a casket made of stone."
9763,"Flayn: Under a rock... How similar we are! As it were, I took my rest in a casket made of stone."
9764,"(Choice 3) I don't know.
Flayn: Oh. Well, I suppose one's first long slumber is difficult to recall..."
9765,"Flayn: Oh. Well, I suppose one's first long slumber is difficult to recall..."
9766,Byleth: ...
9767,"Knight of Seiros: Pardon the intrusion, but we must prepare a counterattack! Now! It seems the Imperial Army found out about us entering the monastery!"
9768,Seteth: Hm. That is sooner than expected. They must have been spying on us...
9769,Flayn: I wonder if we can win on our own...
9770,Knight of Seiros: There aren't many of them... It looks like we'll just be facing the ones who were stationed nearby.
9771,"Seteth: Did they move on us too soon? Perhaps if we fight by using the land to our advantage...
Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's proceed carefully.
Seteth: Of course. If we are careful, we will not lose.
Choice 2: Let's destroy them.
Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!"
9772,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's proceed carefully.
Seteth: Of course. If we are careful, we will not lose.
Choice 2: Let's destroy them.
Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!"

9774,"Seteth: Of course. If we are careful, we will not lose."
9775,"Choice 2: Let's destroy them.
Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!"
9776,"Flayn: Yes, I agree. Let us take them out in one fell swoop!"
9777,"Seteth: Never again will those Imperial scoundrels disgrace Garreg Mach with their presence! Onward, Professor!"
9778,Suggested Level: 27
9779,Victory Conditions: Rout the enemy.
9780,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth falls in battle (classic), all of your units fall in battle (casual), or a defended location is captured."
9781,"Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!"
9782,Seteth: Clever tactics are our only hope here. We will use fire to deal with the main enemy force.
9783,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
9784,"Seteth: If we allow them to take the interior, the monastery will be lost. We must drive them back!"
9785,Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
9786,"Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!"
9787,Seteth: Our troops are preparing the attack. Protect them until they reach their destination!
9788,Seteth: Ugh... To think we'd let Garreg Mach fall twice to these rebels...
9789,Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
9790,"Seteth: Watch out, Professor! They're coming for you!"
9791,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
9792,Seteth: Our fire unit was destroyed. The plan has failed...
9793,"Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!"
9794,Seteth: All is prepared. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. Traitors! Repent of your sins and the goddess may yet show you mercy!
9795,Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
9796,Seteth: Now! Begin!
9797,Imperial Soldier 1: Fire! Gyaaaaaah!
9798,Imperial Soldier 2: It burns! Save me!
9799,"Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!"
9800,Seteth: Press the attack! Give them no quarter!
9801,Caspar: You must be Randolph... My uncle.
9802,"Randolph: Caspar?! Yes, indeed... So, I see you have chosen to oppose the Empire. If so, be warned that I won't hesitate. I'll strike you down, even if we're of the same house!"
9803,Caspar: You took the words right outta my mouth! Graaagh!
9804,Randolph: For my house! For justice! I will not be defeated!
9805,Randolph: No... This can't end here...
9806,Seteth: We face a powerful enemy today. But Garreg Mach will remain secure.
9807,Seteth: We drove back the Imperial army. The real fight has only just begun...
9808,"Caspar: I never thought I'd be fighting Randolph... I guess it can't be helped, seeing as how I've left my own territory and all. But...what will I do if my father or brother get involved. I really don't want to face them..."
9809,Byleth: We must stay strong.
9810,"Ferdinand: Too true, Professor. So long as the Empire is our enemy, we cannot avoid fighting those we are acquainted with. Though I suppose I have it easier since my house is no longer on the Empire's side."
9811,"Dorothea: My friends from the opera said they would leave the capital and go west... So, at least I won't be seeing them in battle."
9812,"Linhardt: Hmm, I don't think I care if my own house falls. Let's make it a grand fight...after a grand nap of course..."
9813,"Petra: It does not give me happiness to have the people of Brigid involved...but it is not the time to be thinking of that. If it is a possibility, I will be having their strength."
9814,"Bernadetta: I don't mind at all. Really! I have no friends anyway, and my father hasn't done much to make me care for him. Not that he'd ever step on a battlefield anyway! Oh, but I do wonder how Mother is doing..."
9815,"Seteth: Each of our situations is unique. What we share is companionship and the will to fight as one. Professor, you are the heart of our efforts. We will support you as best we can."
9816,"Seteth: I have a proposal. It would be most difficult to fight the Imperial army with the forces we have now. As such, I believe we should send messengers to whatever lords we can trust in the Kingdom and the Alliance so that we may gain their support. Do you agree?"
9817,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: It is heartening to hear you say that.
Choice 2: It concerns me.
Seteth: It is difficult to know who we can trust, of course. But we cannot just stand idle either."
9818,"Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: It is heartening to hear you say that."
9819,Seteth: It is heartening to hear you say that.
9820,"Choice 2: It concerns me.
Seteth: It is difficult to know who we can trust, of course. But we cannot just stand idle either."
9821,"Seteth: It is difficult to know who we can trust, of course. But we cannot just stand idle either."
9822,"Seteth: If all we do is bide our time, out enemy's main army will come down upon us like a hammer from above."
9823,Shamir: Who are you planning to ask?
9824,"Catherine: Sadly, House Charon is out. We can trust them, but they have no help to offer."
9825,"Alois: Hm, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? Their leader is sure to at least respond.
(Alternatively, if Alois wasn't recruited) Flayn: Oh, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? I recall that their leader was quite exceptional."
9826,"(Alternatively, if Alois wasn't recruited) Flayn: Oh, how about House Daphnel of the Alliance? I recall that their leader was quite exceptional."
9827,"Seteth: Judith, the Hero of Daphnel... Yes, that is a fine suggestion. That territory is on the border of the Kingdom and the Alliance. It has not yet been claimed by the fires of war. If they agree to lend us their troops, out forces will be greatly strengthened. We shall send along a secret messenger at once."

"
9837,"Nothing to report today!
"
9838,"It still gives me difficulty...
"
9839,"He's nowhere to be found.

9840,"Too bad...

9849,"It's kind of funny.
"
9850,"The Valley of Torment is an astute decision.
"
9851,"So much has changed...

9852,"I was unsure what we were going to do...

9861,"It's overwhelming.

"
9864,"Don't let your guard down.
"
9865,"Judith, eh?
"
9866,"So you intend to march into Ailell.
"
9867,"Not what I had in mind.
"
9868,"Please be OK...
"

"
9870,"We refused their offers.

9871,"We've been scraping by.
"
9872,"In response to the resistance army's plea, Judith has agreed to provide soldiers. To meet up with the reinforcements, the resistance army sets out for Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Unbeknownst to them, something else awaits them there...
"
9873,"Seteth: Ah, it's you."
9874,Flayn: We were just talking about Rhea...
9875,Seteth: We have searched for five long years but have not found a trace of her. It is possible that she is sleeping somewhere... Just as you were sleeping all those years.
9876,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is that what you think?
Seteth: That is my current theory, yes.

9883,"Seteth: The messenger we sent to Daphnel returned with a reply. Please, read it at once."
9884,"Judith's voice: I understand your situation. I will help you with whatever strength I have to spare. But there is a problem. Openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the Alliance. Therefore, I will secretly gather troops in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Will your group be able to receive the soldiers in this location? From there, it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the Alliance and the Kingdom."
9885,"Byleth: Ailell, the Valley of Torment..."
9886,"Seteth: Ailell is a deep valley located on the border of the Kingdom and the Alliance. People stay far away. There, we can meet without anyone finding out. It is decided. Make plans to meet up with our reinforcements at once."
9887,"Church Soldier: Ailell, the Valley of Torrment..."
9888,"Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell."
9889,"Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain..."
9890,"Caspar: I didn't think we'd end up fighting Randolph... He's my uncle. Well, not by blood, so... I guess I can handle it."

9897,"Dorothea: Hey, Professor, thanks for your hard work again! Nothing to report today! Was I convincing? Was it like he was standing right in front of you? Some things are the same as they were five years ago, but I guess a lot more has changed..."
9898,"Petra: Since the past, I have learned much of the language of Fódlan. But speaking the Fódlan language still gives me difficulty. I can understand, read, and write with nearly perfection now. But understanding and speaking are...fruits of a different color."

9919,"Ingrid: My family, the Galateas, are an offshoot of the Daphnel family. The family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance. Despite blood relations, the families lived apart from one another, so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged. I'm not so much acquainted with Judith, the head of House Daphnel."

9946,"Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems like an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared."

9955,"Alois: Even though we're getting reinforcements, we should still be prepared for the worst. Never shirk your training, no matter what. To practice, I'm going to chop something up with my sword. Unless you'd like to train together! Care to spar?"

9972,"Soldier: It seems some of our friends believe that if we get those reinforcements, we'll be set for provisions too. But I think it's best not to hold our breath on the food front. With the added headcount from the reinforcements, there will be even more mouths to feed."

9975,"Knight of Seiros: With the Faerghus Dukedom in place, the Kingdom is essentially no more.

I've spent most of the past five years drifting through Alliance Territory. I've only recently returned."
9994,Resident: Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to Abyss pretty frequently. We never dealt with them though. We refused their offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force. It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good. Only then there were beasts all over the place...
9995,"Resident: When the monastery fell from ruin, we lost all hope for support from the church. Most able-bodied folks abandoned Abyss for the surface around that time. Since then, we've been barely scraping by..."

9999,"Anna: Thanks, friend! That's a huge relief. Now I can finally open up shop! I'll be sure to swing by the monastery again, so keep an eye on the schedule and bring lots of gold."
10000,"Girl: When I got home after eating, I realized that the special thing Anna asked me to look after had vanished! Oh, what do I do..."
10001,"Girl: Hey, thanks a lot! From now on, I'll do my absolute best to live up to the standards Anna set for all merchants! Oh, and if I open a shop, I hope you'll pay it a visit or three, Professor!"
10002,Linhardt: I'm overheated and have changed my mind. I'd like to return to my cozy bed now.
10003,Bernadetta: Who knew somewhere so hot existed in Fódlan. I wonder if it's OK to walk everywhere...

10041,Yuri: Do you truly intend to forfeit your life for House Rowe? There's still time to change your mind.
10042,Ashe: I finally understand Lonato. He knew the price of standing for his beliefs...and he paid it gladly. I will do the same.
10043,Yuri: I like you- don't be an idiot. Or maybe I'll just have to smack some sense into you.
10044,"Ashe: I know this is it, but... I don't want to die..."
10045,Ashe: You want to spare me? Why? I'll... I'll do it. I'll join your side. Let me fight for you.
10046,"Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!"
10047,"Gwendal: So. You've chosen to turn your blade against the count. Heh. Never thought I'd see the day, mongrel."
10048,"Yuri: And yet you are seeing it, aren't you? Say what you will. I know your true feelings for me. Sure, you watched my back by order of the count. But you cared too. You were the only one who treated me as an equal."
10049,Gwendal: That is all in the past. This is no time for misplaced sentimentality. I must do what I came here to do.
10050,"Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die... Young ones... I thank you..."
10051,Seteth: That was quite a predicament. But now we can see to the objective we had in mind.
10052,Judith: To think we'd get into a scrap here of all places. We're lucky we all made it out alive.
10053,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long.
Choice 2: I see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
10054,"Choice 1: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long."
10055,"Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long."
10056,"Choice 2: I see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
10057,"Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
10058,Judith: So you're that professor everyone talks about. You're just as Claude described.
10059,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Claude?
Judith: He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy.
Choice 2: That professor everyone talks about?
Judith: You used to teach at the Officers Academy five years back, right? I guess you didn't teach Claude, though. He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy."
10060,"Choice 1: Claude?
Judith: He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy."
10061,Judith: He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy.
10062,"Choice 2: That professor everyone talks about?
Judith: You used to teach at the Officers Academy five years back, right? I guess you didn't teach Claude, though. He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy."
10063,"Judith: You used to teach at the Officers Academy five years back, right? I guess you didn't teach Claude, though. He asked me to help you because you seemed trustworthy."
10064,Seteth: Claude of the Alliance? How did he learn of our plans? We can't underestimate someone like him... There is a reason they call him the Master Tactician. But I suppose we are both fighting against the Empire now. The enemy of our enemy is our ally.
10065,Judith: That's right. I have a letter from him as well.
10066,(image of letter appears)
10067,Judith: It's up to you to decide how to use it.
10068,"Seteth: That is yours, Professor. Please tell me what it says when you see fit."
10069,"Judith: OK, let's wrap up this hand-off of soldiers. Not that I suspect you of anything, but... I must warn you that these are very important soldiers for my territory. Don't treat them like expendable equipment."
10070,(Byleth nods)
10071,"Judith: Oh. By the way, I have some important information. A witness saw Lady Rhea being dragged off by the Imperial Army after the battle five years ago."
10072,Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?
10073,Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
10074,Alois: It seems we chose wisely when decided to fight against the Empire.
10075,Seteth: Thank you for the information. We will rescue her at all costs.
10076,"Seteth: Now that we have reinforcements, it is time to advance against the Empire. And yet, we do not have enough troops to face our enemy's main army head-on. We have no choice but to use our small numbers wisely by taking over key locations as we blaze our way to the Imperial capital."
10077,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's an easy win. (Relationship with Seteth down)
Seteth: Do not indulge in being overly optimistic. It would be our ruin.
Choice 2: It will be a fierce fight.
Seteth: Yes, it will. We must brace ourselves."
10078,"Choice 1: It's an easy win. (Relationship with Seteth down)
Seteth: Do not indulge in being overly optimistic. It would be our ruin."
10079,Seteth: Do not indulge in being overly optimistic. It would be our ruin.
10080,"Choice 2: It will be a fierce fight.
Seteth: Yes, it will. We must brace ourselves."
10081,"Seteth: Yes, it will. We must brace ourselves."
10082,"Seteth: As you know, the Oghma Mountains lie south of Garreg Mach, towards the Empire. In order to enter Empire territory, we must travel around those mountains. There are two possible routes--through the Kingdom to the west, and through the Alliance to the east."
10083,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's go west.
Seteth: The western half of the Kingdom is under the Empire's control. It may be too dangerous to pass through there. I suggest we take the eastern route, for safety.
Choice 2: Let's go east.
Seteth: Yes, that makes sense."
10084,"Choice 1: Let's go west.
Seteth: The western half of the Kingdom is under the Empire's control. It may be too dangerous to pass through there. I suggest we take the eastern route, for safety."
10085,"Seteth: The western half of the Kingdom is under the Empire's control. It may be too dangerous to pass through there. I suggest we take the eastern route, for safety."
10086,"Choice 2: Let's go east.
Seteth: Yes, that makes sense."
10087,"Seteth: Yes, that makes sense."
10088,"Seteth: There are lords in the Alliance who support the Empire, but they are, at least, not completely under their control. Furthermore, you hold a key to the Empire within your grasp."
10089,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Claude's letter?
Seteth: Yes, precisely.
Choice 2: The Sword of the Creator?
Choice 3: My charm?
Seteth: This is no time for tomfoolery. I am referring to the letter from Claude."
10090,"Choice 1: Claude's letter?
Seteth: Yes, precisely."
10091,"Seteth: Yes, precisely."
10092,Choice 2: The Sword of the Creator?
10093,"Choice 3: My charm?
Seteth: This is no time for tomfoolery. I am referring to the letter from Claude."
10094,Seteth: This is no time for tomfoolery. I am referring to the letter from Claude.
10095,(reads Claude's letter)
10096,"Claude's voice: Hey there, Teach. It's been a while, hasn't it? I never dared to imagine you might still be alive. Wonders never cease! I don't know exactly why, but I feel that I can trust you. So I'm going to do just that. To that end, I propose an exchange. You're intending to invade the Empire. That much is clear. And that means your only option is to pass through the east. You'll have to cross the Airmid River, which runs along the border between the Empire and the Alliance. That means you'll need to gain control of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the one closest to Garreg Mach. It just so happens that my family, House Riegan, is in conflict with House Gloucester right now. It would be easy enough for us to eliminate them, but I would prefer that we settle things without it coming to that. Do you see where I'm going with this? We'll act as a distraction and draw House Gloucester away from there. That will allow you to cross through their territory and take the Great Bridge of Myrddin. After you take the bridge from the Imperial army, House Gloucester won't be able to receive their aid. You'll get to cross Myrddin without any trouble, and I'll be able to maintain stability in the Alliance. Not a bad deal, eh? I hope to hear from you soon. Be well, Teach."
10097,"Seteth: The Master Tactician, indeed. Somehow he is already aware of our plan. The conditions are not bad... All is he says it is. If we take the Great Bridge of Myrddin, and House Gloucester bows down to House Riegan... The route from the monastery to the Empire will be much safer for our forces."
10098,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's do it.
Seteth: It seems you are decided. We will send our answer at once.
Choice 2: I'm suspicious.
Seteth: I am afraid we have no choice, considering the circumstances..."
10099,"Choice 1: Let's do it.
Seteth: It seems you are decided. We will send our answer at once."
10100,Seteth: It seems you are decided. We will send our answer at once.

"
10106,"The resistance army, having received reinforcements from House Daphnel in Ailell, is finally ready to unleash its invasion on the Imperial territories.
"
10107,"I won't give in.
"
10108,"I bet they're watching.
"
10109,"The Airmid River sure is big...
"
10110,"Ah, my heart is heavy with all this...
"
10111,"Strange feelings...
"
10112,"This is unsettling...
"
10113,"It's thanks to you...
"
10114,"I ever tell you about Lord Gwendal?
"
10115,"Let's all work together!
"
10116,"Do you remember?
"
10117,"So, that was none other than...
"
10118,"I'm so full!
"
10119,"Next stop, the Great Bridge of Myrddin!
"
10120,"Professor...
"
10121,"Pillars of light...
"
10122,"Professor!
"
10123,"Maybe someday I'll be...
"
10124,"We must defeat the Imperial army.
"
10125,"She reminds me of...much.
"
10126,"Most intriguing...
"
10127,"Need something, Professor?
"
10128,"I wish...
"
10129,"A woman after my own heart.
"
10130,"The Hero shouldn't be taken lightly.
"
10131,"Why'd they take Lady Rhea?
"
10132,"It's hard on everyone...
"
10133,"It won't happen again!
"
10134,"We'll do what we can.
"
10135,"Count Gloucester...
"
10136,"We can trust you, right?
"
10137,"We must hurry.
"
10138,"The Great Bridge of Myrddin...
"
10139,"I thought she'd fight alongside us.
"
10140,"Ugh.
"
10141,"Huh...
"
10142,"At last...
"
10143,"I've never met someone like Judy.
"
10144,"Lots to report, as usual.
"
10145,"I'm glad for it.
"
10146,"The gesture means a lot.
"
10147,"Sights set on Enbarr, the resistance army avoids the Oghma Mountains, choosing instead to move south along the eastern route that passes through the Alliance. To make it safely through the territory of House Gloucester - supporters of the Empire - the army seeks help from the head of House Riegan, Claude. Claude vows to draw away House Gloucester's troops so that the resistance army can advance to the Airmid River - a dividing line between the Alliance and the Empire.
"
10148,"Scene Change
"
10149,"Seteth: The messenger we sent to Claude has returned. It seems he will be initiating the plan immediately. We will advance when House Riegan's forces move out. We will take the Great Bridge of Myrddin with minimal casualties, and in doing so, initiate all-out war with the Empire. We must prepare for battle, Professor."
10150,"What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River. For the sake of my family, I wish we could invade the Empire from there. But I do not have the power to advocate for that. Strategically, Myrddin is more important."
10151,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Someday, we'll take it back. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Choice 2: Taking it back would be difficult.

Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!"
10155,"Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!"
10156,"Since I'm originally from the Empire, it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks. Fine by me. Honestly, I'd bet they're watching my every move to make sure I can be trusted."
10157,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do.
Choice 2: Probably. (Relationship with Linhardt up)

10161,"Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?"
10162,"Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in Fódlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!"
10163,"War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever even finding out."
10164,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sounds like you're learning.
Choice 2: Isn't that a little pessimistic? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)"
10165,Choice 1: Sounds like you're learning.
10166,Choice 2: Isn't that a little pessimistic? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
10167,"Bernadetta:
Oh, that'd be awful--just terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out."
10168,"Oh, that'd be awful--just terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out."
10169,"We're going to invade the Empire...which means we'll be fighting people we know, won't we? If we're attacked by someone we know, or used to think of as a friend, is it permitted to run away?"
10170,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Choice 2: I wouldn't blame you. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
10171,"Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale."

10175,"Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire, Right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy..."
10176,Felix: We have the Empire and Alliance situations under control. The problem is Faerghus. The eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the Dukedom. But I've heard nothing about that conflict as of late. It's strange. I haven't heard much from my father either. I can't help but find this silence unsettling...
10177,"Ashe: It's thanks to you that I'm here now. I owe you, Professor. You saved my life. I swear I'll do all I can to repay that debt."
10178,"Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was gonna die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it."
10179,"Mercedes: Lady Rhea is in the Empire, isn't she? We should hurry up and find her. So many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried... I want to ease their minds as soon as possible, Professor. Let's work together to find her!"
10180,Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
10181,"Byleth:
Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Choice 2: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
10182,"Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)

10186,"Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days..."
10187,"Ingrid: So, that was Judith. Just as I'd heard of her, she was an upstanding person. The same Daphnel blood runs through my veins, and yet I feel as though I am nothing like her. I am but a phantom of what could be..."
10188,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're actually quite alike. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: You think so? Wow, thank you!
Choice 2: True, you do differ.
Ingrid: If only I could be even half of who she is."

10193,"Raphael: Thanks to all that food from Judith, I'm full for once! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?"
10194,"Ignatz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin isn't just a bridge, It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom."
10195,"Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across the river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire."
10196,"Marianne: Legend says that pillars of light fell and ravaged Ailell. I was reminded of that when I saw it... Up, Professor? Do you think those legends are true?"
10197,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's likely.
Marianne: I think so too. I don't know if the goddess really destroyed the valley out of anger, but...
Choice 2: Yes, and it'll likely happen again. (Relationship with Marianne up)

10202,Marianne: There are still so many things we don't understand in this world.
10203,"Hilda: It looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town. I guess they feel safe now that you and the Knights of Seiros have returned. Peddlers have become more common too, so there'll be food and supplies available. After being run-down for all those years, it's really becoming livable again!"
10204,"Leonie: Things would have gotten a lot more interesting if Judith had joined us. I only spoke to her briefly, but I really liked her. I hope someday I can be as strong, kind, and levelheaded as her."
10205,"Seteth: If Rhea really is in the Empire, then we must defeat the Imperial army by any means necessary. The people at large are just as concerned for Rhea's safety as we are. The sooner we can settle all our unease, the better."
10206,"Flayn: Judith is a wonderful person. So strong and confident, as well. Looking upon her, I was sharply reminded of my mother."
10207,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Did she look similar?
Flayn: Not in the slightest. Rather, it is her way of being--her demeanor. Brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.

10212,"Flayn: I...lost my mother, long ago. I miss her desperately."
10213,"Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does you talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating."
10214,"Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?"
10215,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.

10219,"Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
10220,"Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor."
10221,"Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Glad as I am that Judith told us, I wish we had known this five years ago. We spent all that time spread out over Fódlan, searching for the archbishop and you. It was a mistake to abandon the monastery, to leave it in ruins. Now we're paying for that mistake."
10222,"Catherine: I'd heard of the Hero of Daphnel, but that was the first time I've met her in person. She's the head of a prestigious noble family? Just like Claude. The Alliance nobility is so...odd."
10223,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You don't think she acts like a noble?
Choice 2: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? (Relationship with Catherine up)"
10224,Choice 1: You don't think she acts like a noble?
10225,Choice 2: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? (Relationship with Catherine up)
10226,"Catherine: Kind of, but I don't mean that in a bad way. You won't find such big-hearted nobles elsewhere. Plus, Judith can drink with the best of'em! A woman after my own heart."
10227,"Shamir: Five years ago, when the Imperial army attacked Garreg Mach, they moved with incredible speed. But in the middle of all that chaos, she still had operatives watching. The Hero of Daphnel's spy network is impressive. She shouldn't be taken lightly."
10228,"Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was dragged off by the Imperial army? I heard that was true. Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor...they didn't take her to kill her, did they?"
10229,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Choice 2: They probably haven't killed her.
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
10230,"Choice 1: I don't think so.

10234,"Cyril: You gotta help her, Professor. I'm begging ya."
10235,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
10236,"Gatekeeper:  Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Oh! I heard what happened at Ailell. I can't believe Imperial spies have been lurking in Garreg Mach! Under my watch! But I'll make sure no more of 'em get in, trust me!"
10237,"Monk: Hearing that the Knights of Seiros have returned, the monks have also been coming back. We still don't have enough hands here, but we'll use all that we've got to rebuild the monastery. Until the day that Lady Rhea is returned to us, we have to do all we can..."
10238,"Knight of Seiros: Count Gloucester of the Alliance is supposed to be the head of the faction that supports the Empire. That being said, the count himself is an ardent follower of Seiros, and likely not too keen on fighting us. The commoners are also allies of the knights. We should be able to reach Myrddin without incident."
10239,"Soldier: We came from the territory of House Daphnel. It's not easy to leave one's home, but it had to be done. Judith asked us so earnestly, there was no way we could have refused. We can trust you, right? I'd hate to end up just another pointless death..."
10240,"Priest: With life returning to the monastery, the unease of the church's followers is slowly abating. The number of people coming to the town church dwindled over the past five years, but we're seeing a resurgence. To reward and accommodate their devotion, we have to hurry and rebuild the church!"
10241,"Soldier: On the north side of the Great Bridge of Myrddin lies the territory of Acheron of the Alliance, and to the south, the Empire's Bergliez territory. Count Bergliez has held the position of Minster of Military Affairs for the Empire ever since the days of Emperor Ionius. The current emperor seems to have brought the corrupt nobility to heel, but Count Bergliez looks to be an exception."
10242,"Soldier: I was dead certain Judith would fight by our side as well... But since she holds a position within the Alliance, it seems she has no choice but to abstain for now. If the in-fighting within the Alliance came to an end, maybe she'd be able to fight with us..."
10243,"Yuri: Darn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would show up. They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell from way out there. Guess it's been a while since I left House Rowe, so it doesn't bother me much to have to fight them. Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this."
10244,"Balthus: Huh. That lady hasn't changed a bit since I was a kid. Still intimidating as heck. What a woman. Being me, I'm not nervous or anything. I just... I'm not sure how to approach her, that's all. My luck, she'll treat me like I'm still a kid, even though I'm clearly a full-grown adult man. Hm. If that's the angle she takes, maybe I can get a some nice hugs out of this... Huh?! Oh, nothing."
10245,"Constance: Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still the wild palpitations in my chest. I have made myself ready to the extent that I could, but now that the day draws near... I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle. Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands."
10246,"Hapi: I've never met someone like Judy. She's easygoing, but at the same time, tough as nails. I bet she'd be real fun to hang out with."
10247,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I like her too. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: Judy's great. Unlike that other guy, Lord What's-His-Name.
Choice 2: She scares me a little.
Hapi: Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know? Judy's great. Unlike that other guy, Lord What's-His-Name."

10251,"Hapi: Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know? Judy's great. Unlike that other guy, Lord What's-His-Name."
10252,"Hapi: I can't stand people like him--People who think they're always in the right. All he did was make trouble, but he convinced himself it was for a good cause. So infuriating."
10253,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports need to be reported. And for all reportable things, I'm your guy."
10254,"Rogue: Not sure what brought people back up above, but I'm surely glad for it. The dining hall, the greenhouse... they're all ripe for the picking again. Uh, I mean, for them! Good for them!"
10255,"Resident: House Daphnel was kind enough to share their food with us. It may not be much in the grand scheme of things, but the gesture means a lot. The Hero of Daphnel is something else too, isn't she? Balthus seems to be pretty taken with her..."
10256,"Seteth: It seems that the knights' presence has been encouraging to the merchants. It is good that the market is active, but we should make certain that the area is safe for trade."
10257,Seteth: Thank you for looking after the merchants. Their safety is one of the keys to peace and prosperity in the region. You have done us a great service.
10258,"Seteth: This is the Great Bridge of Myrddin, one of the bridges that cuts across the Airmid River between the Empire and the Alliance. Its defenses have been fortified since I last was here. It seems the enemy is sufficiently prepared."
10259,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's end this quickly. (Relationship with Manuela up)"
10260,Choice 1: Let's end this quickly. (Relationship with Manuela up)
10261,"Manuela: That's the idea, Professor. Let's make this quick and painless. So much that it's over before they even know it's started.
Choice 2: Steady now. (Relationship with Hanneman up)"
10262,Choice 2: Steady now. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
10263,"Hanneman: If they are fully equipped, we must prepare ourselves for anything. We must be ready to change our approach in an instant."
10264,"Seteth: Yes, that is most sound. I do not distrust Claude, but there is no guarantee that the other Alliance lords will not move against us. Onward, with caution."
10265,"Ferdinand: After we cross the Great Bridge, the greatest plains in Fódlan will be before us. You do remember, do you not? I speak of Gronder Field, where we fought the Battle of the Eagle and Lion."
10266,"Caspar: The ones defending the Great Bridge... It isn't my father or brother, is it? I really want to finish this battle without seeing them. Especially my father..."
10267,"Linhardt: Yes, I hear your father can fell a bear without even a weapon in hand. When we run into him, I'll be sure to let you take the lead. Family matters, and all."
10268,"Caspar: That's not funny, you jerk!"
10269,Petra: Should we be burning the signal of uprising?
10270,"Dorothea: There's no need for that, Petra. Smoke or no smoke, they'll get the idea. Losing the bridge should be a pretty big clue."
10271,"Bernadetta: Oh no! I can't believe we're actually going to invade! If Edelgard...gets angry... Oh, I get nervous just picturing it! Stop that, imagination! Oh, and if she destroys the monastery with her army, we're all gonna die!"
10272,"Seteth: The hour of questioning has long since passed. I assure you, whatever happens, this will not end as it did five years ago. Back then, the Empire was able to focus its entire army on Garreg Mach. Now their front lines are stretched thin along their borders with both the Kingdom and the Alliance. Their allies have grown in number, but so have their enemies. They should not have too many soldiers they can readily send our way. Now then, let us set forth! This shall be the first step in ending the chaos that has engulfed this realm!"
10273,Suggested Level: 31

10278,"Ladislava: That symbol... It's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!"
10279,"Seteth: That is Ladislava. She has, of late, made quite a name for herself as a general. Be on your guard."
10280,Seteth: We will control this fortress if we can eliminate all the enemies within it.
10281,Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!
10282,Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge form us
10283,Seteth: It appears enemy soldiers are stationed in the fortress. More will come. Stay on your guard!
10284,"Lorenz: I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, have arrived to join the battle in my father's stead! (Lorenz is either unrecruited or alive.)"
10285,Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too! (Lorenz is killed in part 1 in classic mode.)
10286,Ladislava: Thanks for making your way here. Annihilate the enemy with the rest of them!
10287,Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
10288,Acheron: I've got to make her name known to Her Majesty through distinguished service.
10289,"Seteth: That is Acheron, a minor Alliance noble. If he has allied with the Empire, then we must destroy him."
10290,"Ladislava: I can't retreat... Even if it costs me my life, I've got to protect the Great Bridge."
10291,"Lorenz: You're inviting me to join you? But...to abandon House Gloucester... No--I can convince my father. I will help you topple the Empire, I swear it!"
10292,"Seteth: Goddess, please forgive the sins of the enemy leaders and the brave soldiers who followed their orders."
10293,"Seteth: Somehow we managed to capture the Great Bridge of Myrddin. To see the Imperial Army hold its ground until every last soldier fell... That is true dedication. It is clear that Edelgard is not some cruel emperor who holds her people in a vice-like grip. There is something more driving our foes. From here on out, our journey will not be an easy one..."
10294,"Church Soldier: Excuse me, sir! Gilbert is here!"
10295,Seteth: Gilbert?! What was he doing all this time? We had better go and meet with him.
10296,Gilbert: So you've captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin. I'm impressed you were able to break through their defenses.
10297,"Seteth: Save your praise, Gilbert. Let's get to the heart of the matter. Why are you here? Why now?"
10298,"Gilbert: I am once again in the service of Dimitri. He was in hiding in Fraldarius territory, where he was biding his time for a counteroffensive."
10299,Seteth: Dimitri is alive?!
10300,"Gilbert: Yes. He was to be executed in Fhirdiad, but Dedue stepped forward to rescue him. I am here today by command of Dimitri himself. We realize that our enemies are the same...and that it may be advantageous to join forces."
10301,Seteth: I see. I shall hear you out.
10302,"Gilbert: We are preparing to advance against the Empire. Will you join us as we march toward the Imperial capital? If that is too much to ask, then at least allow us to freely cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin."
10303,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We will join you.
Seteth: Hold a moment. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few.
Choice 2: You may cross freely.
Seteth: Agreed. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few."
10304,"Choice 1: We will join you.
Seteth: Hold a moment. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few."
10305,"Seteth: Hold a moment. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few."
10306,"Choice 2: You may cross freely.
Seteth: Agreed. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few."
10307,"Seteth: Agreed. We have just finished a fierce battle, and our forces are few."
10308,"Seteth: To march straight for the main body of the Imperial army and challenge them? It is too soon. I am happy yo allow you safe passage over the bridge, but to lend our aid asks too much of us. Is that not so? If you would be willing to wait a few months, we might be able to offer something more."
10309,Gilbert: I am afraid His Highness is not able to stop his advance...
10310,"Seteth: If that is the case, I am afraid we cannot join you. Please, send our regards to Dimitri."
10311,"Gilbert: I understand. It's unfortunate that we were not able to secure the help of the Knights of Seiros. Still, I'm grateful that we can cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin safely. Thank you for that. This will be a fight to the death. It is highly likely that we will meet our end. I wish you both the best of luck in the battles ahead."
10312,Seteth: And may the goddess protect you as well.

10330,"Any news of Claude?
"
10331,"You gotta be nice to 'em...

10332,"The battle was pretty gruesome.
"
10333,"Now is the time to prove ourselves.
"
10334,"I used to think death meant so little...
"
10335,"One more twist.

10336,"Hope you can keep up...

10368,Seteth: We are in the middle of a military conference. Please calm yourself and tell us what is the matter.
10369,"Church Soldier: Yes, sir! It seems that the Kingdom and Alliance armies clashed with Imperial forces on Gronder Field! Amid the chaos of three armies battling each other out there, the Imperial army was routed! Edelgard sustained heavy wounds and retreated to Enbarr!"
10370,Seteth: Well then! I suppose...
10371,"Church Soldier: Sir! The Kingdom army was also decimated and... His Highness, Dimitri, has been counted among the dead."
10372,Seteth: What?!
10373,"Church Soldier: The Alliance sustained heavy casualties as well. And the whereabouts of their leader, Claude, is currently unknown."
10374,Seteth: Unknown? I...

Choice 2: Dimitri is dead...
Choice 3: Claude is missing..."
10376,Choice 1: Edelgard is injured...
10377,Choice 2: Dimitri is dead...
10378,Choice 3: Claude is missing...
10379,"Seteth: It must have been a brutal fight. To have lost His Highness... How tragic. Our only solace is that Edelgard sustained severe injuries. This is all quite unexpected, but we must find a way to use this situation to our advantage. The Empire's main force has suffered a mighty blow. Edelgard will most certainly avoid the front lines. Now is the time for us to infiltrate the Empire and aim for the capital."
10380,Flayn: But...what will happen to the lords of the old Kingdom and Alliance territories?
10381,Seteth: They have lost many leaders and soldiers. I am sure they must be hard at work rebuilding. We will foster cooperation by aiding them through the local churches. The remaining lords of the Kingdom and Alliance must join together to form one union. And you should be the one to lead them... What do you say?

Choice 1: We should set out.

10387,Choice 1: We should set out.
10388,Choice 2: Let's decide where to invade first. (Relationship with Seteth up)
10389,Seteth: We must choose a place within the Empire that will give us solid defenses for our front line... That will become the foothold for our invasion of the capital. There is one massive fortress that boasts the greatest defenses in the Empire...Fort Merceus. But we will stand no chance if we attack by traditional means. We must gather everyone and devise a plan of attack.
10390," ???: ... It has been a lifetime... Hasn't it, Professor?"
10391,Byleth: (turns with shock on their face) I thought you were dead.
10392,"Dimitri: Yes... I thought so too. I wanted to slice her throat...but I did not get the chance. I let people die, and yet... I still stand. Rodrigue, Gustave, Dedue..."

10404,Byleth: ...
10405,"Seteth: I can't say for certain that you were dreaming, but if someone did come here to see you... That person only wanted you to see their face. Perhaps they wanted you to guide them..."
10406,"Ferdinand: Dimitri, the late prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive."

10410,"Ferdinand: True enough, but I suspect the reason he died is that he could not keep his emotions in check. I see. You are saying you met with Dimitri? But you could not tell if it was reality or a dream. Hm. I wonder what it could mean."
10411,"Linhardt: I'm rather curious to see what stratagem we'll devise to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses..."
10412,"Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days."
10413,"Bernadetta: It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really, hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!"
10414,"Byleth:

Choice 1: Though actors die, the show goes on? (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must be unaffected.

10425,Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.
10426,Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
10427,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why's that?
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.
Choice 2: Because it's like hunting? (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey. Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries."
10428,"Choice 1: Why's that?
Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries."
10429,Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.

10432,Felix: It hasn't sunk in yet. They slaughtered the boar... I can hardly believe it. I thought he was alive all this time. He must have really hated Edelgard to lead such an ill-advised assault. Hmph. No point in feeling sorry for the poor scoundrel now.
10433,Dedue: I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.

Dedue: That's true. I did hear that his body was never found.

Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean (Sylvain says anyway). I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Choice 2: You might be right. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor."
10444,"Choice 1: That's not the best analogy.

10447,"Sylvain: Ha! I knew you'd get it, Professor."
10448,"Sylvain: Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice."
10449,"Mercedes: Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting... And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then..."
10450,Annette: Professor. They tell me my father died at Gronder. Was that... Was that really a fitting end for one such as him? I don't know. I just...don't know.
10451,"Ingrid: I only know what little I overheard. But what I did hear implied that the Empire was involved in the Tragedy of Duscur. If it's true, that may explain why His Highness chose to fight the Empire. Perhaps I should have fought alongside His Highness."
10452,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because...I too, lost someone to that tragedy--the most important person in my world.
Choice 2: Are you having regrets? (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong."
10453,"Choice 1: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because...I too, lost someone to that tragedy--the most important person in my world."
10454,"Ingrid: Because...I too, lost someone to that tragedy--the most important person in my world."
10455,"Choice 2: Are you having regrets? (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong."
10456,Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong.
10457,Ingrid: Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry on the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated.
10458,Lorenz: Fort Merceus is old and strong. It's reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are you certain your plan is sufficient? It seems to be a little simplistic.
10459,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Guess we'll find out. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: That's not terrifically reassuring! Shouldn't you have more faith in your own plans?!
Choice 2: We'll be fine.
Lorenz: I suppose I must take you at your word, mustn't I?"
10460,"Choice 1: Guess we'll find out. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: That's not terrifically reassuring! Shouldn't you have more faith in your own plans?!"

Lorenz: I suppose I must take you at your word, mustn't I?"
10463,"Lorenz: I suppose I must take you at your word, mustn't I?"
10464,"Lorenz: Incidentally, have you heard any news of Claude? I, for one, have a hard time believing he is dead. He was always a clever and tenacious sort."
10465,"Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If you're muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired."
10466,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, ""how""? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Choice 2: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!"
10467,"Choice 1: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, ""how""? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious..."

10470,"Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!"
10471,"Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"
10472,Ignatz: It sounds like the battle at Gronder Field was pretty gruesome. We don't know for certain whether Claude's alive or dead. Maybe he's all right? I wish I could make sure somehow. But it doesn't seem possible now.
10473,"Lysithea: If Claude somehow survived, I imagine he's terribly wounded. All three forces have suffered heavy losses. We're incredibly lucky to have not been involved. This is a perfect and unique opportunity to go on the offense. Now is the time to prove ourselves, Professor."
10474,"Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died... But when I think of all those who died at Gronder, I realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little..."
10475,"Hilda: I like this idea of yours--dressing as Imperial soldiers so they'll let us in. But don't you wish there was one more twist in the plan? Come on, Professor, think! How could we add another wrinkle, hm?"
10476,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can dress you as the emperor. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
Choice 2: We could dress Seteth as a woman.
Hilda: Seteth, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."
10477,"Choice 1: We can dress you as the emperor. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!"
10478,Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
10479,"Choice 2: We could dress Seteth as a woman.
Hilda: Seteth, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."
10480,"Hilda: Seteth, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."
10481,"Hilda: On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer."
10482,"Leonie: Under your leadership, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor."
10483,"Seteth: The battle at Gronder Field certainly took an unexpected turn, did it not? Let us press on, so as not to waste the opportunity. Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. I will make the necessary preparations. Be ready."
10484,Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman war is--how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.
10485,"Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?"
10486,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Choice 2: Fódlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
Choice 3: The Stubborn Old General. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
10487,"Choice 1: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod."
10488,"Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod."
10489,"Choice 2: Fódlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat."
10490,Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
10491,"Choice 3: The Stubborn Old General. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
10492,"Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
10493,"Hanneman: Seems Fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose..."
10494,"Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all. And if I'm honest...sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived."
10495,"Alois: You're quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. In a frontal attack, our losses would be tremendous. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!"
10496,"Byleth:
Choice 1:That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? ""Deceit""? Again?
Choice 2:That's a bad pun. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!"
10497,"Choice 1:That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? ""Deceit""? Again?"

Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!"
10500,"Alois: Ah, rats! You've seen through my cunning punning!"
10501,"Catherine: I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow."
10502,"Shamir: Did you give the ridiculous order to prepare Imperial armor for every one of our troops? I've reached out through all my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough."
10503,"Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see."
10504,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful at least.
Choice 2: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."
10505,"Choice 1: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful at least."
10506,Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful at least.

Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."
10508,"Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."
10509,"Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use."
10510,"Anna: A Class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must've been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?"
10511,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone..."
10512,"Monk: I've come here after getting chased out of the Empire. There's no place for our kind there anymore. But there are still many inside Empire territory who haven't abandoned their faith in the Church of Seiros. I pray that one day, we'll get the chance to rebuild the church within the Empire..."
10513,"Soldier: Doesn't matter how sturdy the keep, if the commander defending it is incompetent, it can fall as easy as anything. That's what they say, at least. I wonder if that applies to Fort Merceus... All I know is if I was the emperor, I'd never in a million years assign an incompetent commander to a fort as important as that one!"
10514,"Knight of Seiros: After that great battle earlier, the balance of power in Fódlan has shifted greatly... But we only stood a chance because we drove the Empire from the Great Bridge of Myrddin. To get revenge for all our fallen friends, we'll have to stake our lives on the fight that lies before us."
10515,"Soldier: Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude... All the house leaders from way back when assembled again at Gronder. I wonder what their thoughts were as they headed out to the battlefield..."
10516,"Priest: According to information we've received from the Eastern Church, the Alliance territories seem to be experiencing intense upheaval. Their leader's well-being is still unclear, and the lords are all questioning each other's intentions. It seems like a difficult time to ask the Alliance for assistance..."
10517,"Churchgoer: I've come to deliver vegetables we harvested in the village to the monastery's dining hall. Because of the season, I couldn't pick that much...but I wanted to help the church out, even just a little bit. We're busily planting seeds, so when things start to grow, I'll be back."
10518,"Soldier: The fish in this pond get fed every day, so they're swimming all lazy and serene... But the only reason they're kept here is so that they can one day be used for food. But the fish don't know that, so they just swim around happily... It's a bit of a miserable thought, but aren't soldiers much the same?"
10519,"Knight of Seiros: I've heard that Gilbert, who used to serve in the Knights of Seiros, fell at Gronder. Apparently he was originally a knight of the Kingdom. And now he's shared Prince Dimitri's fate. Gilbert was an exceptional knight. It's an unspeakable shame..."
10520,"Yuri: If the Empire rallies it's forces and attacks Garreg Mach, I'm not so sure Abyss will be OK... If we're not careful, we'll end up buried in rubble."
10521,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You really think so?
Yuri: Like I said, only if we're not careful. If it comes down to it, I'll protect this place with my dying breath.
Choice 2: I won't let that happen. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Heh heh... Ever the valiant one. But nobody ever knows how a war will turn out. That's part of the deal, you know?"
10522,"Choice 1: You really think so?

10525,"Yuri: Heh heh... Ever the valiant one. But nobody ever knows how a war will turn out. That's part of the deal, you know?"
10526,"Yuri: Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I want to ensure there is still a refuge for people to escape to."
10527,"Balthus: You know, House Albrecht also took part in the Battle of Gronder. That's where my little bro is of course... He's very different from me. A smart one, but just about worthless in a fight. I really hope he's OK..."
10528,"Constance:It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's goals, mind you. But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for her ideals."
10529,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Perhaps not. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: I must keep her example in mind as a chart a new path.
Choice 2: Some ideals are worth fighting for.
Constance: Of course, but I've gone down a different road."

10533,"Constance: Of course, but I've gone down a different road."
10534,Constance: Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!
10535,"Hapi: People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and nobles clashing over territory. Things like that. So before the war, when folks talked about how peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent are you living on?"" I get it now. I few isolated skirmishes here and there are nothing compared to a full-blown war. The one truly peaceful place I've known is the village where I grew up."
10536,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports need to be reported. And for all reportable things, I'm your guy."
10537,Resident: Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?
10538,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No. The men aren't as few as that.
Resident: Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something. (Gives 5 Mythril)
Choice 2: Yes. Easily twice as many women.

10543,"Rogue: I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter down here--nowhere else to go. Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their strongest people to this fight. Count Bergliez in the Empire, Lord Holst in the Alliance... I'm sure the Kingdom's got someone too."
10544,Rogue: What a pain. What an absolute pain...
10545,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What's the Matter?

10550,"Resident: I used to be a rather important person in the church, but...I am in exile for committing a crime. I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed! My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church wasn't putting in enough to rebuild..."
10551,"Soldier: Whenever I think about the next battle, my knees won't stop shaking. I'm scared of getting hurt, or worse... Is there a medicinal herb I can use to calm my nerves?"
10552,"Soldier: It really calms you down if you make a tea out of it. Ah, even the smell is soothing! Thank you so much. Now I feel like I can fight again."
10553,Seteth: We are just about to pass through Gronder Field. We should be in view of Fort Merceus soon. It looks like the battle made quite an impact... The Imperial Army has lost some of its luster. We should soon be able to invade the fort without too much trouble.
10554,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Because of the Alliance and Kingdom's sacrifices...
Seteth: Yes, we must win for them as well.

10561,Choice 1: Disguises?
10562,Choice 2: Infiltrate the fort?
10563,"Seteth: I believe this was your idea, was it not? It is impossible to take Fort Merceus with a frontal assault. We must take it from within. We will infiltrate the fort as Imperial troops and kill the enemy general. All preparations are complete."
10564,"Caspar: According to the scout reports, my father and the others are not inside the fort. It seems they were moved to the front lines of the Kingdom's western region."
10565,Church Soldier: The Death Knight became the general of this fort after the battle at Gronder Field.
10566,Bernadetta: What?! The Death Knight?! I think I'll be taking a break now... You guys go on ahead.
10567,"Petra: Bernadetta, you cannot be hiding on a field. The enemy will be seeing you."
10568,Bernadetta: No place to hide?! I guess... I have no choice but to fight!
10569,"Seteth: The Death Knight... I hear that he is counted among the greatest heroes of the Empire at the moment. We never determined whether or not he was truly Jeritza. So in capturing Merceus, we have encountered another obstacle."
10570,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We've beaten him before. (Relationship with Seteth up.)

10576,Dorothea: That fort has been brought to life on stage for countless operas...
10577,Seteth: Let us commence. We must puncture a hole in the Empire's defenses!
10578,Death Knight: That man/woman approaches... Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours...

10584,Imperial Soldier: Report! A group posing as Imperial soldiers has infiltrated! They seem to be affiliated with the church!
10585,Death Knight: Close the gates. Leave no survivors.
10586,Death Knight: The time is ripe
10587,(escape route revealed)
10588,Seteth: Do not let him get away! Circle around and cut off his retreat!
10589,Death Knight: I have no need of you.

10593,"Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!"
10594,Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
10595,Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again

10597,Death Knight: My true identity has no value.

10599,"Death Knight: If you desire to slay me, follow. The appointed hour is at hand..."
10600,Death Knight: It is coming... Leave now or all of you will die.
10601,Alliance Soldier in Imperial gear: Run! We have to evacuate immediately!
10602,Alliance Infantry Soldier: What just happened here?
10603,"Alliance Armoured Soldier: The fort, it's... It's just... gone."

10610,Seteth: All we can do is retreat to the Great Bridge of Myrddin and assess our situation.
10611,"Manuela: Well now, that marching was nearly as trying as the battle itself."
10612,"Hanneman: We wasted a few days, but now that we're this far back, we should be safe... Or so I believe."
10613,"Catherine: I still can't believe it. The fort was destroyed, just like that..."
10614,Shamir: The Death Knight knew about the attack. Was it the Empire's doing?
10615,Cyril: Guess that means they'd rather destroy the fort than lose it.
10616,"Alois: Whatever the case, we need to get our bearings and decide what we're going to do next."
10617,"Seteth: We all have many questions, but for now, we must focus on our next move."
10618,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's give up.
Seteth: What?! How could... Ah. Yes, I see.
Choice 2: Let's attack the Imperial capital.
Seteth: I wish for that as well, but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan. Hmm... But by the look on your face, I have the feeling you are working out a plan even now.
Choice 3: Let's return to the monastery.
Seteth: What?! If we return to the monastery, then our situation is sure to... Ah. Yes, I see..."
10619,"Choice 1: Let's give up.
Seteth: What?! How could... Ah. Yes, I see."
10620,"Seteth: What?! How could... Ah. Yes, I see."
10621,"Choice 2: Let's attack the Imperial capital.
Seteth: I wish for that as well, but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan. Hmm... But by the look on your face, I have the feeling you are working out a plan even now."
10622,"Seteth: I wish for that as well, but we are sure to fall if we charge in without a plan. Hmm... But by the look on your face, I have the feeling you are working out a plan even now."
10623,"Choice 3: Let's return to the monastery.
Seteth: What?! If we return to the monastery, then our situation is sure to... Ah. Yes, I see..."
10624,"Seteth: What?! If we return to the monastery, then our situation is sure to... Ah. Yes, I see..."
10625,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Now you've got it.
Choice 2: Whatever do you mean?
Seteth: No need to hide your intentions from me."
10626,Choice 1: Now you've got it.
10627,"Choice 2: Whatever do you mean?
Seteth: No need to hide your intentions from me."
10628,Seteth: No need to hide your intentions from me.
10629,"Seteth: So, we make it appear as though we have ceased our invasion by returning to Garreg Mach. Then we divide up our soldiers and infiltrate nearby areas of the capital right under the Empire's nose. Finally, we gather all of the soldiers somewhere we can get to swiftly from Garreg Mach and proceed to invade Enbarr. Is that what you are thinking?"
10630,(Byleth nods)
10631,"Caspar: Are you serious? You know there's no guarantee that we won't be spotted by the enemy, right?"
10632,"Ferdinand: If we fail to intervene, we will be isolated inside the Empire and be...utterly obliterated."
10633,Petra: I will be embracing the nearness of death if I am needing to. With each other!
10634,"Bernadetta: That sounds dangerous...really, incredibly dangerous!"
10635,"Seteth: Make no mistake...if we fail in this plan, there will be no coming back from it. Are you sure about this, Professor?"
10636,Byleth: It's our only hope.
10637,"Seteth: I see. If you are resolved, then I will follow suit. We may be weaker and the terrain may be against us, but all we can do is use our resources the best we can. That, and pray for the blessings of the goddess."

"
10641,"The resistance army successfully takes Fort Merceus. Their victory celebrations are cut short, however, when javelins of light pierce the sky and destroy much of the fort. With nowhere else to go, the resistance army withdraws to Garreg Mach. Under the guise of surrender, they secretly prepare for a surprise attack on the Imperial capital.

"
10644,"We made it here.
"
10645,"Enbarr used to have a different name...
"
10646,"We might lose if he's there...
"
10647,"The capital will be a battleground soon.
"
10648,"Our paths will be colliding...
"
10649,"Bring me my quarry.
"
10650,"Then those things appeared...
"
10651,"Gonna stay calm. Gonna stay focused.
"
10652,"It's been so long...
"
10653,"The capital will be a battlefield...
"
10654,"We must win--no matter the cost.
"
10655,"My first time in the capital...
"
10656,"Wonder if I'll get to see the opera house...
"
10657,"We seem to be finishing up here.
"
10658,"...
"
10659,"If we can win this war...
"
10660,"Aaaah!
"
10661,"Time for revenge.
"
10662,"Are you prepared?
"
10663,"Truly regrettable.
"
10664,"Back in the capital again...
"
10665,"I'm worried about the opera company...
"
10666,"Finally. Am I right, Professor?
"
10667,"Looks like we're nearing the end.
"
10668,"Compared to back then...
"
10669,"Soon we'll be with Lady Rhea again.
"
10670,"According to a merchant...
"
10671,"It's hard on everyone...
"
10672,"The pressure's on!
"
10673,"What to wear...
"
10674,"What was that light in the sky...
"
10675,"All we can do is pray.
"
10676,"It'll be fine... Right?
"
10677,"I pray they're safe.
"
10678,"The canal...
"
10679,"Enbarr is a holy place.
"
10680,"We don't have a choice.
"
10681,"This doesn't feel entirely sane.
"
10682,"If only I still had noble connections...
"
10683,"Who's left?
"
10684,"Now I know...
"
10685,"Those lights...
"
10686,"Please don't tell anyone!
"
10687,"We don't hear a lot.
"
10688,"There are no new quests this month.
"
10689,"The resistance army, having finished preparations for their surprise attack on the Imperial capital, departs Garreg Mach. Along the way, they join forces with ally soldiers who had already secretly entered Empire territory. Together, they storm the streets of Enbarr, giving the Imperial army no time to counterattack.
"
10690,"Seteth: It seems the preparations for our invasion of Enbarr are advancing smoothly. All has been laid out so we can move swiftly to the necessary locations. Until the time comes, please try to keep your spirits up."
10691,Byleth: I understand.
10692,"Seteth: There is something else... I have heard that Rhea is potentially being held captive in the capital. The information could not be confirmed, nor even properly sourced, but even still... We cannot ignore the possibility. Please bear that in mind."
10693,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If it's true, we'll find her.
Seteth: Yes. We must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her.
Choice 2: I don't believe it.
Seteth: Do not say that. To receive any information at all is surely a boon. If it is true, we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her."
10694,"Choice 1: If it's true, we'll find her.
Seteth: Yes. We must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her."
10695,Seteth: Yes. We must not let anything get in the way of rescuing her.
10696,"Choice 2: I don't believe it.
Seteth: Do not say that. To receive any information at all is surely a boon. If it is true, we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her."
10697,"Seteth: Do not say that. To receive any information at all is surely a boon. If it is true, we must not let anything let in the way of rescuing her."
10698,Flayn: We're finally heading to Enbarr. The capital city of the Empire... So many memories there...
10699,Caspar: Oh yeah? So you've been there before?
10700,Flayn: Oh! Um. Yes. Though it was a very long time ago.
10701,Caspar: A very long time? You must have been really young. I'm surprised you remember.
10702,Dorothea: The main stage of the Mittelfrank Opera Company is in the capital... I hope no one from the opera gets swept up in the coming chaos...
10703,Linhardt: There are many buildings straight out of the history books in Enbarr. I hope they remain unharmed...
10704,"Dorothea: You're worried about the buildings? What about the people? You're an odd one, Lin."
10705,Linhardt: I am also worried about the people. I'm sure my father is in a palace in the capital.
10706,"Flayn: Many people reside in Enbarr, so we must take care to avoid needless casualties."
10707,"Bernadetta: I don't think Edelgard cares much for avoiding casualties, so that's probably impossible. I bet we'll be fighting until one side or the other is completely destroyed."
10708,"Petra: Bernie, you should be staying away from thoughts like that. We will be defeating her with our full power. Our enemy has great strength, but we will not be losing!"
10709,"Ferdinand: I could not agree more. Remember, even if our surprise attack works, a force even greater than all of our troops combined awaits us in the capital. Zero casualties is always the goal, but we must not underestimate the situation at hand."
10710,"Flayn: Still, we must not hold ourselves to the same twisted morality that she does. After all, we are here to stop her, not to follow her down her dark path. We all choose to fight back. We are all in this together!"
10711,"Bernadetta: You're right, Flayn. We've got to try our hardest!"
10712,Dorothea: A different path from Edelgard...
10713,Ferdinand: There is no stopping her. The only way to end this is to kill her.
10714,"Petra: Our choice... Flayn, your words are wonderful and full of bravery."
10715,Caspar: Let's go! We can't lose!
10716,Linhardt: The situation is dire...and so I will do what must be done.
10717,"Flayn: I am certain that if we can join our strength, we can win this battle without losing a single soul!"
10718,"Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild Fódlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor..."
10719,"Linhardt: They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another."
10720,Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
10721,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!
Choice 2: It sounds like you're scared. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!"
10722,"Choice 1: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!"
10723,"Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!"
10724,"Choice 2: It sounds like you're scared. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!"
10725,Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
10726,"Caspar: If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make peace with that."
10727,"Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside."
10728,"Dorothea: The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage... Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can't let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town."
10729,"Petra: Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding."
10730,"Felix: The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees."
10731,Ashe: Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus.
10732,"Sylvain: So Enbarr, the capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to the enemy or your own fear."
10733,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me...
Choice 2: We'll get through this together. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?"
10734,"Choice 1: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me..."
10735,"Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me..."
10736,"Choice 2: We'll get through this together. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?"
10737,"Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?"
10738,Mercedes: It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...
10739,"Annette: Enbarr... Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?"
10740,"Ingrid: Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and Fódlan?"
10741,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Peace will reign. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: Peace you say? It sounds so...foreign, so unattainable. But maybe...just maybe.
Choice 2: What would you like to see happen?
Ingrid: My hope is for a world of peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past--the stuff of legends. I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I won't allow for anything else."
10742,"Choice 1: Peace will reign. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: Peace you say? It sounds so...foreign, so unattainable. But maybe...just maybe."
10743,"Ingrid: Peace you say? It sounds so...foreign, so unattainable. But maybe...just maybe."

There is no alternative here. I won't allow for anything else."
10746,"Lorenz: I have been to the Kingdom capital before, but never to the Imperial one. They say it is the biggest city in all Fódlan, so we will no doubt have many civilians to worry about. I hope we can preserve the city. If it is destroyed in the battle, the people will face hardship. I would say we should avoid the use of excessive force, but I suppose that hinges upon the Empire's terms of engagement."
10747,Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?
10748,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Mitreflanc Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Choice 2: Mittelfrank Opera Company. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!
(Choice 3) Mildewplank Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
10749,"Choice 1: Mitreflanc Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
10750,"Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
10751,"Choice 2: Mittelfrank Opera Company. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!"
10752,"Raphael: Ah, that's the one!"
10753,"(Choice 3) Mildewplank Opera Company.
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
10754,"Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
10755,"Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see them perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we can at least see the building?"
10756,"Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how Fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it. On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?"
10757,"Lysithea: Invading the capital and smashing the Empire. I wonder if doing so could really end this war. Care to share your thoughts, Professor?"
10758,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think it'll end the war.
Lysithia: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true.
Choice 2: I don't know. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithia: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge."
10759,"Choice 1: I think it'll end the war.
Lysithia: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true."
10760,Lysithia: You say that with such confidence. I want to believe that it's true.
10761,"Choice 2: I don't know. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithia: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge."
10762,Lysithia: Perhaps you feel similarly to me. The whole mess puts me on edge.
10763,"Lysithia: Although for now, better to focus my efforts on the fight at hand."
10764,"Marianne: So, if we win the war...will you become the ruler of Fódlan?"
10765,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That might be the case. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Choice 2: I don't really know."
10766,Choice 1: That might be the case. (Relationship with Marianne up)
10767,Choice 2: I don't really know.
10768,"Marianne: You seem unsure, so I guess anything is possible. For what it's worth, I think you'd make a good ruler. You could bring peace to the land..."
10769,"Hilda: Fighting in the capital? Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine."
10770,"Leonie: We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace."
10771,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think you're right. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: Who can say for sure?"
10772,Choice 1: I think you're right. (Relationship with Leonie up)
10773,Choice 2: Who can say for sure?
10774,"Leonie: Monica killed Captain Jeralt for the Flame Emperor, and the Flame Emperor was Edelgard. I know that the future of all Fódlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!"
10775,"Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?"
10776,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: Excellent
Choice 2: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."
10777,"Choice 1: I am. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: Excellent"
10778,Seteth: Excellent
10779,"Choice 2: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."
10780,"Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."
10781,Seteth: The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.
10782,"Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in a church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable."
10783,"Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the darned place ever since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined."
10784,"Manuela: In the opera, actors came and went all the time. But the people behind the scenes would stay forever. I'll bet I'd know a few of them now, even after all these years. I wonder if they've left the capital. I certainly hope so..."
10785,"Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. I don't know what comes next. But we can sort out those details later."
10786,Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
10787,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Probably (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings."
10788,"Choice 1: Probably (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings."
10789,Choice 1: Probably (Relationship with Catherine up)
10790,Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
10791,Choice 2: I doubt it.
10792,Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
10793,"Catherine: Lady Rhea's not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you."
10794,"Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. Their final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. I guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs, all things considered."
10795,"Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?"
10796,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll meet her for sure. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Choice 2: We don't know for sure."
10797,Choice 1: We'll meet her for sure. (Relationship with Cyril up)
10798,Choice 2: We don't know for sure.
10799,Cyril: I just gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.
10800,"Balthus: According to a merchant who just came from the Alliance, my little bro made it home in one piece. But House Albrecht lost a lot of troops. So did the nearby lords. Things are real bad over there. If we don't stop the Empire soon, there won't be anyone left to help fight them off."
10801,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
10802,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! ME! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!"
10803,"Soldier: Some of my soldier friends departed for Empire territory a few days ago. They wore trader clothes and hid their weapons in their luggage so that even if they encounter patrols, they won't arouse suspicion. Another squad dressed as traveling artists. It's like a game of dress-up, but with lives at stake."
10804,"Churchgoer: Just recently, the fish in the pond suddenly started thrashing around like mad. I didn't know what was going on, and then I saw something gleaming in the southeastern sky. It happened right when you were out on campaign. I wonder what it could have been..."
10805,"Priest: Ever since the Empire declared war on the church, we have lost all contact with the priests and monks who were in the Imperial capital. I expect there's nothing we can do but pray for their safety, but realistically, it's probably too late."
10806,"Knight of Seiros: We're forming small units and slowly sneaking into the Empire's territory. That allows us to conceal ourselves along the path of the main army's progress, so that by the time we reach the capital, we can all join forces again. However, if any of the units are discovered before we can rendezvous, the whole plan is a bust. I'm sure it will work out though. The Empire seems to think we've abandoned our plans to invade, so they're likely not keeping as close a watch."
10807,"Soldier: I'm from the Empire, myself, and I still have some relatives in Enbarr. I hope they get out in time, but I've no way of contacting them... I guess all I can do is pray they're not harmed."
10808,"Monk: Did you know? A magnificent canal flows through downtown Enbarr. It's said to have been constructed under the guidance of Saint Seiros before the Empire was even formed. Ever since, that canal has been a major lifeline for the capital's development. And now this is how the Empire repays it... Truly, no good deed goes unpunished."
10809,"Monk: Enbarr is where the divine Seiros, sent by the goddess, first appeared before mankind. Saint Seiros then worked countless miracles there, and offered guidance to the people. That's why Enbarr is considered a holy place for the Church of Seiros."
10810,"Knight of Seiros The information about Lady Rhea being held in the Imperial capital came from an Imperial soldier at Merceus? We can't discount the possibility that the enemy's feeding us fake information on purpose... Still, we can only move forward. It's all on you, professor."
10811,"Yuri: Feels like a death wish, attacking the Imperial capital like this. You don't really think we're going to beat the Empire with these paltry forces, do you?"
10812,"Byleth:

Yuri: Heh heh! Is that so? Oh, how I love your resolve.
Choice 2:I don't know...
Yuri: You've chosen your path...now own it. If you can't stand up to me, you certainly can't stand up to the Empire."

10816,"Yuri: You've chosen your path...now own it. If you can't stand up to me, you certainly can't stand up to the Empire."
10817,Constance: Is it true what they say? That the archbishop is a captive of the Empire? I've never heard of anything so brash in all the Empire's long history. It is vexing that Lady Edelgard's true motives elude me. If only I still had noble connections to draw on... The loss of my house has proven to be a thorn in my side again and again.
10818,"Hapi: The Kingdom and the Alliance both came out of the last fight looking battered and broken. If the Empire is wiped out too, then who's left to run the joint? I guess the next leader of Fódlan could be...you. I'd be really psyched about that."
10819,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Remember that battle six years ago? Oh... Um, I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight who watched over Abyss with me for a while? I've been on the hunt for his whereabouts and... I finally found out what happened to him. My friend...is no longer with us. Dead. Figured as much, but now I know for sure. I did get to meet his big sister, at least. I'll never have the chance to thank him for our time together...but maybe I can find a way to help out his sister instead. Bet he would have liked that."
10820,"Hermit: Those lights that came down on Merceus...I might have seen them before, here at Garreg Mach. They looked like they'd rain down right on top of us, but at the last moment, they veered off... I think they crashed into Ailell. It must have been the goddess's blessing that protected us."
10821,"Resident: Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here. I'm in hiding from the army. I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home. Justice, ambition--what does any of that matter if you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?"
10822,"Resident: I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff. There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five years on... It's just a fact of life. What? there have been lots of battles on the surface recently? I haven't heard! See what I mean?"
10823,"Seteth: There it is. The greatest city in all of Fódlan... Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Deep within are the palace grounds, where the emperor resides. If Rhea is being kept here, she must be within the palace... We shall tear through the city streets, capture the palace, and kill Edelgard at last."
10824,"Shamir: If the enemy spots us, they'll call back any troops deployed in other areas. We have no leeway here."
10825,"Cyril: Lady Rhea, please be safe."
10826,"Seteth: Now, we must organize our reserve troops and invade Enbarr!"

10832,Seteth: It appears that Hubert and the Death Knight are in command of the Empire's forces in the city. We've not the time to deal with them one by one. Split up and take both on at once!
10833,Imperial Soldier: It's here! The Crest of Flames banner! There! On the other side of the canal!
10834,"Hubert: Uninvited guests, I see. Heh. Let's ensure they receive a warm welcome. Ready the artillery. Prepare to attack. Rocks, arrows, magic--rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Defend the heavy weapons until they arrive."
10835,Flayn: That church... It looks familiar. I believe that is where my parents first met.
10836,Seteth: Ah--that church. I've such memories of that place. From a time before I was Seteth.
10837,Manuela: Has it really been so long since I was in that opera house? Couldn't have imagined any of this back then.
10838,Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.
10839,Hubert: It's almost a shame to kill you. Not even death will make you consequential.
10840,Hubert: I should have disposed of you a long time ago. I will rectify that failure here.
10841,"Hubert: Running into you in the capital like this-I have to say, it's almost sentimental."
10842,Ferdinand: Hubert. She must leave.
10843,Hubert: You really think you can make her?
10844,Ferdinand: It does not matter what I think. Those are my orders.
10845,Hubert: We must place our faith... in Her Majesty... Her victory is everything...
10846,Death Knight: So much has been taken... It is not even. Time to kill...(If the Death Knight was not defeated)
10847,"Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!"
10848,Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
10849,"Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face."
10850,"Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!"
10851,Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
10852,Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!
10853,Mercedes: I came to get you. Let's return together...Emile.
10854,Death Knight: Leave. The place of your death is not here...
10855,"Seteth: We have finally made it. I am sure that Edelgard is hiding in the palace, awaiting our arrival..."
10856,Flayn: Who is that? Is that not Dedue?!
10857,Dedue: I heard knights had arrived. I came here to find you.
10858,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How long have you been in Enbarr?
Dedue: I arrived not long after the battle at Gronder Field. I am here to kill Edelgard.

10859,"Choice 1: How long have you been in Enbarr?

Dedue: I'm waiting for a chance to kill Edelgard. I have not yet been blessed with the opportunity."
10862,Dedue: I'm waiting for a chance to kill Edelgard. I have not yet been blessed with the opportunity.
10863,Flayn: Will you now fight alongside us?
10864,"Dedue: We fight for different objectives. I swore to offer Edelgard's head to his Highness. But... Should I fail, I will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you. This is the information I have gathered during my time in hiding here. It includes details about the inside of the castle. There's more. The archbishop is being held in the palace. I do not know the exact location."
10865,Seteth: Indeed! Just as we suspected!
10866,Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire!
10867,Dedue: I've done what I came here to do. Farewell.
10868,Flayn: Wait a moment!
10869,Flayn: He is gone. I believe we should make our way there as well!

10879,"Seteth: She is one of your students. I understand your desire for a path to peace. But she will never bend to our will. You do understand that, do you not? We have no choice but to kill her."
10880,Ferdinand: We have already killed Hubert. Now is no time to hesitate.
10881,"Caspar: She has it coming! After all, she started this war!"
10882,"Bernadetta: Someone has to stop her, and that someone is us!"
10883,"Linhardt: As her former classmates, I feel we owe it to her to try talking it out."

10887,"Alois: In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!"

10894,"Edelgard: They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of the war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!"
10895,"Seteth: The throne room is tightly locked. But wherever there are locks, there are also keys."
10896,Dedue: So close... Must press on...
10897,Imperial Soldier: Infiltrators! Kill them!
10898,Seteth: Block off the stairwells! Stop their reinforcements from getting through!
10899,Seteth: Well done! Their reinforcements are cut off.
10900,Edelgard: Clever tactic. It's going to be difficult to turn the tables now.
10901,"Dedue: I cannot vanquish her alone. So I will join you in this battle. But if I fall, leave me. My only wish is for Edelgard's head."
10902,"Edelgard: So you're another of the goddess's vanguard. You don't have a shred of self-awareness, do you? Come at me, so that I may put you out of your misery!"
10903,Edelgard: This has nothing do to with where you were born. That we are fighting now is only a result of the choices you've made. So I'm going to give that the response it deserves. I will crush you with everything I have!
10904,"Edelgard: Professor... I suppose you think you can defeat me. Is that right? But I will never give up. Even if my arms and legs failed me, I would still find a way to move forward. I will smash that false goddess and her minion into the ground! I will fight to free this world from her vile grasp!"
10905,Flayn: Edelgard! Please! Release Rhea... Release Fódlan!
10906,"Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!"
10907,Edelgard: Lysithea. You and I are so alike. We could have walked the same path.
10908,Lysithea: We're alike? You don't mean to tell me... It can't be!
10909,"Edelgard: Yet now, we are at a crossroads. There's no turning back. Must we fight each other for the things we believe in!"
10910,"Lysithea: That's exactly what's going to happen. And I will defeat you, Edelgard."
10911,Seteth: Edelgard! Return Rhea! Release your grip on Fódlan!
10912,"Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people"
10913,Constance: What use are words? We are both set on our path.
10914,Edelgard: How predictable. But so be it. I will now show you my true power!
10915,Edelgard: It looks as though... my path... will end here.
10916,Edelgard: My teacher... claim your victory.
10917,Edelgard: Strike me down. You must!
10918,"Edelgard: Even now... across this land, people are killing each other. If you do not act now, this conflict... will go on forever."
10919,Edelgard: Your path... lies across my grave. It is time for you to find the courage to walk it.
10920,Edelgard: If I must fall... let it be by your hand.
10921,Edelgard: I wanted... to walk with you...
10922,"Seteth: At last, it is over... Now we must find Rhea."
10923,Flayn: Professor! Brother! I have a letter. The Imperial general asked me to deliver this to my instructor.
10924,"Seteth: Who is it from? Hurry up, Professor. Read it at once."
10925,"Ferdinand: It is from...Hubert? Though he has left this world, he is reaching out through this letter..."
10926,"Hubert's voice: If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas."
10927,"Seteth: What Hubert has written here... I cannot... No, I know it must be true. And if that is the case, then all else makes sense now. I must speak with Rhea. It seems our battle is not over just yet. Those who slither in the dark... We must kill every last one of them, or Fódlan will never again know peace."
10928,Flayn: They are allies of Monica and Tomas... Correct? The ones who were after my blood. And also the ones who destroyed Fort Merceus with that mysterious light...
10929,Seteth: We shall discuss this more after we have rescued Rhea.
10930,Rhea: You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?
10931,"Rhea: Seteth, Flayn... You are here as well... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me."
10932,Seteth: Rhea... I am overjoyed that you are unharmed. I could not stand losing another of our kind.
10933,Rhea: Yes... I am reminded of the past... of reuniting in Enbarr...
10934,"Seteth: It is truly nostalgic. I would love nothing more than to lose ourselves in memories of the old days, but... I must tell you something, Rhea. We have received incredible news, albeit from the Empire. They have told us the identity of our enemy. Those who slither in the dark... It is time for us to stop hiding the truth about the goddess—the progenitor god. The truth about us. It is time for us to tell the people everything."
10935,Rhea: Those who slither in the dark...
10936,"Flayn: We are told they despise the children of the goddess, as well as those who live above ground. They are planning something horrible."
10937,Rhea: ...
10938,"Seteth: Please, tell the professor everything about these vile people. There must be things that only you know."
10939,Rhea: I understand. Dear child... I will now tell you all that I know. It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of Fódlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis...
10940,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The King of Liberation...
Choice 2: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator..."

10943,"Seteth: Nemesis, the King of Liberation... The man who received the Sword of the Creator from the goddess and became a hero. However..."
10944,"Rhea: Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator."
10945,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In Zanado?
Seteth: The Red Canyon. We journeyed there five years ago. Do you recall?
Choice 2: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Rhea: The legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods...is false. That story was created after the fact."
10946,"Choice 1: In Zanado?
Seteth: The Red Canyon. We journeyed there five years ago. Do you recall?"
10947,Seteth: The Red Canyon. We journeyed there five years ago. Do you recall?
10948,"Choice 2: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Rhea: The legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods...is false. That story was created after the fact."
10949,Rhea: The legend that the goddess gifted him the sword so that he could fight the wicked gods...is false. That story was created after the fact.
10950,"Rhea: I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to Fódlan... A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own..."
10951,"Seteth: It was surmised that someone was collaborating with Nemesis, and there was a massive investigation to uncover who it was. But the truth was never discovered. I am now certain that his accomplices were Those who slither in the dark. And this time, they have utilized the imperial army to send Fódlan back into the flames of war..."
10952,"Flayn: So, Edelgard has made a temporary alliance with them in order to achieve her own aims... Professor, we must journey to Shambhala and stop them!"

10979,"Seteth: The Empire has been defeated, and we have rescued Rhea. But still, the flames of war burn on. We journey to Shambhala, where those who slither in the dark reside."
10980,Flayn: We know nothing of the place or what we can expect to find there.
10981,"Seteth: What Flayn says is true. If we are to prevail, we must be prepared for any eventuality before we advance."
10982,Rhea: I will accompany you.
10983,"Seteth: What?! No! That would be far too dangerous! Your long confinement weakened you greatly, did it not?"
10984,Rhea: Those people have opposed us since ancient times. I wish to learn the truth about them for myself.
10985,"Seteth: I...I understand. I will not stop you, but please take care not to overexert yourself."
10986,"Bernadetta: What?! But she's been hiding away so long! She shouldn't just up and go somewhere scary. Trust me, it's a bad idea!"
10987,"Linhardt: Bernadetta, ""hiding away"" seems a poor description for someone who was imprisoned."
10988,Ferdinand: We must be careful not to put undue stress on Lady Rhea.
10989,"Caspar: If the going gets tough, we'll have to carry her on our backs and make a run for it!"
10990,"Dorothea: You think you can carry her? Um, maybe someone else should do that part..."
10991,"Petra: No matter what enemies are appearing, we will be protecting her. We will be winning!"
10992,"Flayn: If we work together, I am certain all will be well..."
10993,"Seteth: The ones we are soon to face have eluded us for a long time. There is much to fear... We must all proceed with utmost caution, lest we fall prey to one of their traps."
10994,"Ferdinand: The history of the Empire spans 1185 years. And just like that, it ends. But the Hresvelg legacy could live on... When Edelgard assumed power, there were no other rightful heirs. She said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by the virtue of merit, not blood. And she truly meant what she said. At any rate... I feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart. Who knows if it can ever be filled?"
10995,"Linhardt: As history proves, everything comes to an end eventually. I knew that all along, but it still came as a surprise. Those who slither in the dark... It's all so fascinating and strange. They must certainly have a long history of their own. And when they fall, that will come quickly too. Don't you think? Heh, that almost sounded like a prophecy there. Am I spooking you yet?"
10996,"Caspar: He's dead... My father's dead... I'm OK though. Really. I was ready for it. He was a general in the Imperial army, after all. Minister of Military Affairs... He gave his own life so the Empire's soldiers wouldn't have to lose theirs. That's a fight that only he could take on. He was such a tough guy. I fought side by side with you this whole time. But did I ever get any stronger? Will I ever be as strong as my father?"
10997,"Bernadetta: With Edelgard gone, maybe Fódlan will finally find some peace. That's all well and good, but, um... She was also the one to put my father under house arrest, so now he's been released, and he's taken charge of House Varley. I can't handle it! I can't deal with him! Please, you have to do something!"

11000,Choice 2: We can put him back under arrest.
11001,Bernadetta: Thank you so much!
11002,"Dorothea: So, the moment we defeat Edie, the nobles cozy up to the Alliance and the Church... That lot really does think only of themselves, and no one else. But then there's Count Bergliez. He used to be Minister of Military Affairs... He sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter... When I heard that... I don't know... that simple act of humanity... I couldn't help it. I burst into tears. You know Count Bergliez is Caspar's father, right? I can't even imagine how Caspar must feel about it."
11003,Petra: The Empire has broken in... in smithereens. Now it is possible for me to go back to Brigid. But... I cannot choose that choice. The time is still too soon for that. We must be stopping the evil for everyone in Fódlan. We will be fighting until the end of it!
11004,"Felix: I thought that after the Empire fell, the boar might finally be avenged... But something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows - an organization behind the Empire. We'll have to take care of them if the boar... if Dimitri is to rest in peace."
11005,"Ashe: I've only ever done what I thought was just. I've got no regrets, but sometimes I do wonder if I've done the right thing. Was all this really for the best? Sorry - thinking about the end of the war makes me reconsider all kinds of things. But it's not over yet, is it? I need to steel myself for the next battle."
11006,"Sylvain: This war might be over but not war in general. Human beings thrive on conflict. We can't get enough of it. I don't know when, but you know someday another war will begin."

11012,Sylvain: War may always come back but so will peace. And peace is what we fight for.
11013,Mercedes: Lady Rhea still seems weak... but at least she's safe now. I'm praying that she'll be well as soon as possible. Goddess... I beg you... Protect Lady Rhea!
11014,"Annette: Finally, that awful war is over. Everyone lost something, and everyone had to make sacrifices... But maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now. Let's hurry to Shambhala, Professor! We have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war."
11015,"Ingrid: Is it really prudent to bring Lady Rhea on our upcoming expedition? It would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous, considering how long she was confined..."

11041,"Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark... It seems we'll finally discover their true form. I get the sense that they're in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child. I wouldn't be surprised if Edelgard was subjected to them too. There's no telling what their true motives are. But whatever their motives, what they have done is unforgivable. They must be exterminated."
11042,"Marianne: I thought the war would end with Edelgard's defeat... But that wasn't the case. This may be premature, but I'm feeling a little relieved. I'll have to consider what I'll do with myself and where I'll go when this war is finally over... I don't have an answer yet... Let's make sure the next battle puts an end to this war. That way we can all move forward!"
11043,"Hilda: ""Shambhala"" it was called, right? Scary that it's so close to the House Goneril territories. Who'd have thought all those creeps were living under my nose? I was hoping my big brother would help us in the next battle. But he says that I can represent House Goneril without his help. That I have it in me. I'm glad he recognizes that I have some ability. Still, I wish he wasn't leaving it all to me."

11050,"Seteth: Rhea is sleeping right now. If it is not absolutely urgent, please do not disturb her rest. The long confinement took its toll on her health. Truthfully, she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all - to say nothing of a military expedition. To make matters worse, we are now facing a very old enemy. One that has conspired against us since time out of mind. Please proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling."
11051,"Flayn: I am so glad that Rhea is unharmed. My brother continues to worry about her, however. Of course, I am worried myself. I cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state... I hope she will rest now and leave it up to you and my brother to see things through."
11052,"Hanneman: A mysterious organization, slithering in the dark of Fódlan... Like something out of a midnight tale. It appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the Empire. After the fall of Enbarr, they've remained well concealed... That said, I would keep an eye on Edelgard's uncle, Lord Arundel. Something about him sits ill with me."
11053,"Manuela: Professor! I just got word from the opera company. I don't know if everyone survived, but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival. They even asked if I'd consider making a return to the stage someday... I suspect I may refuse though. We're at the dawn of something new. No reason to look backwards, eh?"
11054,"Alois: You've done it. You did it. You crushed the Empire, and rescued Lady Rhea. I'm sure the captain is proud of you right now. As am I, of course! I'm as proud as if I'd done it myself!"

11059,"Catherine: We rescued Lady Rhea! I can hardly express my joy. But now we know about a new foe, who intends to bring her harm. In time, we'll realize the peaceful world that Lady Rhea has always hoped for. I'll have to keep that in mind when I'm fighting."
11060,Shamir: We saved Rhea and the Empire has crumbled. The Kingdom may as well be finished too. The reasons for me to remain in Fódlan are fading.

11066,"Cyril: Lady Rhea's back! Lady Rhea's back! I'm so happy! But... things aren't gonna be like they used to be any time soon, are they? There's still folks out there that want us all dead, and Lady Rhea still hasn't regained her strength yet. Speaking of which, Professor, please don't ask too much of her right now, OK?"
11067,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that. Everyone did sterling work! I really thought we'd know peace after that battle. But we're not quite there yet, huh?"
11068,Soldier: I thought that taking the Empire's capital would bring an end to this war... How naive of me. I'll have to write to my family and tell them I'll be gone a while longer.
11069,"Priest: Lady Rhea's return has already been proclaimed to all the churches in all parts of Fódlan... They are also being informed by order of Seteth that visitations are very restricted for the time being. It makes sense. Otherwise, pilgrims would come from all over Fódlan and overwhelm the monastery."
11070,Soldier: Dedue saw to it that Edelgard was destroyed before he departed. His expression once his mission was over... was a bit lonely. I don't know where he went off to after that. Maybe he returned home to Duscur.
11071,"Soldier:I can still see Dedue's struggle when I close my eyes... I don't know why he was so bent on destroying Edelgard... Now that we've completed our mission, I can only pray that his soul is accepted into heaven to rest in peace."
11072,"Churchgoer: So Lady Rhea was all right after all! Well done bringing her back safely! Finally, us true believers may breathe easy again. Simply magnificent! Hm? You're saying the fight isn't over yet?"
11073,"Knight of Seiros: We finally got Lady Rhea back from the Empire and fulfilled our mission. I wish we could afford for her to have a good, long rest... But that just isn't possible."
11074,"Soldier: We won against the Imperial army! I still can't believe it! But I guess we still have some enemies left. I'm not well informed, but I have plenty of fighting spirit!"
11075,"Churchgoer: I heard that Lady Rhea's back! But why hasn't she shown herself to everyone yet? Oh, she's convalescing? Fair enough. She was in captivity for a long time. I pray she feels better soon."
11076,"Monk: Professor! My most heartfelt thanks and congratulations on Lady Rhea's safe return! With your magnificent achievements, maybe you'll join the ranks of the saints one day... I'm sure when the monastery is rebuilt, they'll make a proper statue of you. All majestic and shiny and tall. Oh, I just know they will!"
11077,"Monk: We have succeeded in rescuing Lady Rhea, but Seteth's countenance remains clouded. When will peaceful days return to this monastery? That time feels so distant..."
11078,"Knight of Seiros: Fighting against enemies whose true nature is unknown is honestly really scary. Still... If there's a force in this world that clearly means us harm, we have no choice but to fight back. With our own hands, we'll safeguard Fódlan's future!"

If that's what it takes to achieve peace, count me and my muscles in. This might be my last chance to literally save the world with my strength. Not gonna let that pass me by."

11093,"Hapi: Sounds like there were shenanigans happening behind the scenes in the Empire. I think war was basically inevitable no matter what Eddy did, with those creeps pulling the strings. Come to think of it, I wonder if the lady who kidnapped me was... Never mind. Not worth mentioning."
11094,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear we conquered the Imperial Capital...but the war's still not over? Not sure how much sense that makes, but then, making sense of things isn't my job. Look out for yourself in the next battle. Got it? I'll have lots more things to report by then. That's a promise. In the meantime, I'll be cheering you on."
11095,"Rogue: Nothing tastes better than a drink to celebrate the fall of the Empire! You know... Fraldarius, one of the 10 Elites, is a distant ancestor of mine. Even if the Kingdom as we know it no longer exists, there's a poetic justice in taking the Empire down."
11096,"Thief: I've got a message for ya...from a dead man. The Emperor was keeping the archbishop alive as insurance against those who slither in the dark. ""When you go to Shambhala,"" the message says, ""take the archbishop with you."""
11097,Flayn: To think there is such a vast space hidden beneath the ground. How very creepy.
11098,"Linhardt: Hmm, the atmosphere here is very different from the Holy Mausoleum or the Holy Tomb. Look at the shapes and the light..."
11099,"Caspar: It's too strange... It's all really old, but you get the feeling that it's also...new? I don't understand it."

11101,"Dorothea: I hate the look of things in here. Is this some kind of city? I would never, ever live here."
11102,Bernadetta: Living underground...all safe and isolated... It sounds really... Um! Really awful!
11103,Ferdinand: An underground city hiding those who slither in the dark. I would not mind finishing up here and returning to the surface with haste.
11104,Seteth: Let us search for a way to descend further still. We should survey our surroundings carefully.

11111,Byleth: Why me?
11112,"Rhea: They are aware that you can use the Sword of the Creator. Your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon Nemesis. That is why I must protect you, no matter what. Even if I must die to do so..."
11113,Byleth: I don't understand.
11114,"Rhea: Somewhere in your heart, I believe you do understand. You must at least have your suspicions. There is something I have not yet told you, dear child... I swear to illuminate you once this awful battle has concluded. And at the same time... I will offer my apologies to you. I must, because...when you learn the truth, you will also learn what you are, and how you were born into this world. It will be a hard truth to hear.

As if in Response, priests and knights who are directly related to Rhea by blood change into White Beasts themselves. Facing this unexpected threat, the resistance army prepares for its final battle to save Fódlan.
"
11191,"A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. Rhea's wild rampage was put to an end, averting what could have the greatest crisis in the history of Fódlan After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. The Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance—all political structures that had once shaped the continent—were gone. A unified nation began to take shape under the watchful eye of the Church of Seiros. The church's new leader became a champion of the people, working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction. Just as Saint Seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past, Fódlan's new ruler embraced their role as mother of all life and arbiter of every soul.

11198,Seteth: What? You already knew Rhea's true identity?
11199,"Byleth: Thinking back, I suppose so."
11200,"Seteth: I see. In the past the children of the goddess were all able to change their appearance, just like the Immaculate One. I lost that power long ago, but it seems Rhea has not."
11201,Byleth: You're one of the children of the goddess?
11202,"Seteth: Is it not obvious? Flayn and I both are. We have protected Garreg Mach, and all of Fódlan, for a very long time. But now... the light of Rhea's life is on the verge of disappearing from this world. It is flickering... I do not know if she can be saved. Even if she is, I wonder if she will remain unchanged..."
11203,Flayn: Professor. Are you able to carry on Rhea's work. As the protector of Fódlan and as leader of the people who live here... You must defend the people. Guide them and teach them. Join their hearts and spread peace across the whole of the land.
11204,Seteth: It is not as though you must become the archbishop. But Fódlan needs leadership it is up to you to govern this war-torn land.
11205,Byleth: I...
11206,Seteth: You need not reply right this moment. We will strive to heal Rhea as best we can.

11229,"Bernadetta: Phew... It's all over, Professor. Though I am worried about Lady Rhea... But still, Fódlan is united, and those terrible people lurking in the dark have finally been destroyed. Looks like it's the dawn of a wonderful new era...of blissful seclusion for Bernie!"
11230,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That won't do.

Choice 1: We did lose a lot.
Dorothea: Yes, we certainly did. But we managed to keep a great many things safe, as well.

Choice 1: I'm not sure.
Felix: You shouldn't need that long to decide. Make up your mind. Well, if you do choose to lead, I might like to work for you. But first, I'll go back to the old Faerghus territory. Where my father and my old friends once lived. I need to pay respects, put flowers on their graves.

11282,"Ingrid: Can it really be? Are we truly at peace? To think that my days will not be spent debating war tactics and preparing for battles. It doesn't quite feel real. Now that we are finally at peace, I'm not quite sure what to do with myself."
11283,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Just take it easy.

11289,"Lorenz: The day is ours, Professor. And this victory will ensure our names are immortalized in history. Or perhaps this is but the opening chapter in the tale they will write of our glory.

11345,"Hanneman: Shambhala... An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Strange phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?"

11361,"Shamir:The war's finally over... I have to admit, even I got a little emotional. Rhea's condition doesn't look good. There's nothing to do now but wait. More importantly, are you serious about becoming Fódlan's new ruler?"

But without a royal family in place, they can't seem to reach any sort of agreement, and so the work can't progress. A lot of territory in the old Empire doesn't even have any lords right now, so there are concerns about peace and prosperity breaking down in large areas... It is the duty of the victor to restore order. We must rebuild and reunite as soon as we can!"
11376,"Monk: Once Lady Rhea is fully recovered, she will resume her role as the archbishop of the church. In which case, I do believe you would be the obvious choice for the ruler of the new royal bloodline..."
11377,"Churchgoer: Just when I thought bringing the Empire down would end the war, you had to fight where? Against whom? The noble Knights of Seiros won't tell us commoners any meaningful details. But at least that's the end of the fighting, right? Thanks for riding it out all this time!"
11378,"Soldier: This last series of battles was swift, but vicious. Myrddin, Gronder, Merceus... Many of our allies lost their lives in those battles. But now, we've finally avenged our fallen friends."
11379,"Soldier: I don't think anybody would bat an eye if it was Seteth who ascended the throne. But really, I think we can all agree that the role of tough-but-fair second-in-command suits him best."
11380,"Priest: The most important thing we can do now is to pour all of our efforts into rebuilding the church and the monastery. We've relied on Lady Rhea and Seteth up till now, but after all this, we'll need to do our part too. The church may even need to go through some changes to catch up with the times."
11381,"Churchgoer: Lady Rhea was injured?! How could such a thing happen? Wasn't she supposed to be resting? I can't believe she'd put herself in danger by going into battle in that state... Oh, Goddess... Please save Lady Rhea..."
11382,"Soldier: I've gotta write a letter to my family. They're waiting in my old hometown. I've gotta tell them I'll be coming home soon! I mean, what else could possibly happen?"
11383,"Knight of Seiros: Everyone in the Knights of Seiros is eagerly awaiting your ascension to the throne, Professor. With the ability and virtue you've shown, you've demonstrated all the qualities the leader of a united Fódlan needs. If you're still wavering, we hope you will make your mind up soon."
11384,"Monk: I've heard that you'll take over as the ruler of this new land. Is that true? And here I thought you'd take over for Lady Rhea as archbishop... We'll be lonely here in the monastery if you leave. Oh, hey, why don't we make Garreg Mach the new capital?"
11385,"Yuri: The war's over...for now. We need to think ahead to our next steps. And here you are, the new chosen leader of the land. Though, judging by your expression, you don't seem too enthused."
11386,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you think I'm suited to it? (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: It's hard to say how a region under your rule may turn out. But it'll be interesting to watch it unfold.
Choice 2: Please take my place, Yuri.
Yuri: Heh heh! Very funny. You know elevating the lord of the underground to such rulership wouldn't exactly be well received."

11392,"Balthus: War is over, pal. It's time to relax! Grab some drinks and let loose! Nothing makes a drink taste better than sharing it with a buddy who's fought at your side. Throw in some war stories, and you've got yourself a party."

11399,"Balthus: I was planning to ask some lovely lady to join me, but... Well, let's be honest. Who's more deserving of me than you?"
11400,"Constance: Ahaha! Thanks to my tireless efforts, the war is at an end. But the work of achieving my dream has only begun! House Nuvelle's name shall ring out once more!"

11406,Constance: I'm already deep into several promising avenues of research. Hm-hm-hm!
11407,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. War is over! And it's all thanks to you. That's no small feat, and I bet it took a lot of hard work. On behalf of the world, thank you! On a personal note...I'm, uh, chewing on an idea. Marriage. I'm thinking of getting hitched! If I do... I may have to move up top. The idea of leaving my post is terrifying, to be honest. Not sure what a life up top would even look like. But for her, I'll figure it out. She's worth it."
11408,"Magic Wielder: So you've managed to make it all the way to the end. For once, it seems the stars were wrong. My reading of the stars predicted that, during the war, you would fall to your death. But that was five years ago. Perhaps the prediction was true for you then somehow."
11409,"Jeralt: Sorry... It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her."
11410,Byleth: (Someone I love...)
11411,"Rhea: Sweet child... You have finally come... I am so happy. It does my heart well to see you here, safe and sound."
11412,"Seteth: Have you made your decision, professor? Thankfully, Rhea has survived her trying ordeal. However... There is no telling how much longer her light will continue to shine."
11413,"Flayn: Professor, have you decided? Will you become the next ruler of Fódlan?"
11414,Byleth: ...
11415,"Rhea: Before I hear your answer, I shall fulfill the promise I made to you. You will know the truth about your identity... I will hold nothing back. I... created you. And within you is the crest stone of the progenitor god... I hid the crest stone within your heart in order to revive her. Sweet child... I am sorry. I wanted to see her... see my mother... even if it meant doing that which is forbidden."
11416,Byleth: What does it all mean?
11417,"Rhea: I thought that I could regain all I had lost, if only I could revive my mother... And so I tried to bring her back by creating a body, and then burying a crest stone within it. A young woman I created... my twelfth try after much heartache... was a failure. She grew up lacking the conscience of the progenitor God and fell in love with the captain of the Knights of Seiros. In time, she became pregnant... but she and the child were not able to survive the birth. The child she bore was not breathing, and she herself was in grave danger. The new mother pleaded with me to take the crest stone of the progenitor god from her own body and place it within the baby. If I had done nothing, both mother and child would have died. And so I granted her final wish. As she had hoped, the baby started breathing again... The new life was saved. Your life, sweet child."
11418,Byleth: ...
11419,"Rhea: Well before that, I had saved Jeralt's life using the power of my blood. That means you are the child of a mother born of the progenitor God's crest stone and a father who carried my own blood. I knew, deep in my heart, that you would be capable of housing the conscience of the progenitor god. I was right... And yet, she merely gifted her power to you and then disappeared once more. My dearest wish did not come true… but here you are. You alone wield the power of the progenitor God. And now, I must ask you to use that power to save this world. You must..."
11420,Rhea: What... No... Arrgh!
11421,Seteth: Rhea?! Rhea!
11422,"Flayn: What is wrong? Please calm yourself, Rhea!"
11423,Rhea: GRAAARGH!
11424,Seteth: Is the power of the crest taking over her body? Why is this happening?!
11425,"Knight of Seiros: Seteth! It's terrible! White beasts have appeared all over Garreg Mach! It's hard to believe, but there have been reports that the priests and Knights have been changing form."
11426,Seteth: White beasts... Are they the ones Rhea shared her blood and stones with?
11427,Church Soldier: Seteth! Demonic beasts are heading this way!
11428,"Seteth: They are after Rhea... Professor, our situation is dire. If we do nothing, Fódlan will be destroyed by a rampaging Immaculate One and these ""children"" of hers. There is only one way to stop this. We... we must... Damn it! We have no choice but to kill the Immaculate One... to kill Rhea!"

11432,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
11433,(Classic Mode) Byleth falls in battle.
11434,"Seteth: It is kept secret, but there is a certain rite that all initiates to high office in the church must undergo. In this rite, one pledges to serve the goddess and in return, receives a Crest Stone fragment and blood. The ones who have transformed alongside Rhea just now are the ones who have accepted those gifts. They will shield Rhea--the Immaculate One, I should say--with their very lives. But if we do not strike her down, Fódlan will have no future. To arms!"
11435,"Seteth: Surrounded already, it seems. The White Beasts are those in whom Rhea's blood flows strongest. Until we get rid of them, we will not be able to so much as touch Rhea."
11436,Caspar: Damn. After all that's happened...why do we have to kill Lady Rhea?
11437,Bernadetta: Isn't the fighting already over?! Why do we have to do this to Lady Rhea?!
11438,"Ferdinand: ""The Immaculate One."" We cannot afford to lose here, whoever our foe may be!"
11439,Seteth: Stop! Any damage to the Immaculate One will only be transferred to those beasts.
11440,Petra: It is seeming that my understanding of Fódlan tradition is...insufficient. What is happening?
11441,Seteth: It is too dangerous to approach her now. Capture the southern stronghold first to seal the beasts away!
11442,"Seteth: They're coming one by one from the southern stronghold. If we do not capture it, there will be more."
11443,Seteth: Let us turn our attention to the Immaculate One.
11444,Dorothea: This is it. The final battle.
11445,The Immaculate One: Graaaargh!
11446,Seteth: Rhea?! Not even I have seen this form!
11447,"Linhardt: Well, that's something, isn't it? A shame we must kill her. Consider the research potential..."
11448,Seteth: I will inherit the pride of Nabatea. Rest in peace by Sothis's side!
11449,Flayn: Rhea... How tragic. But there is no time to waste. She must be stopped!
11450,"Catherine: Lady Rhea... With my sword, I will put an end to your suffering."
11451,"Cyril: This is me, paying ya back. No matter what, I'll stop Lady Rhea!"
11452,The Immaculate One: Graaargh...
11453,Seteth: Rhea! Please!
11454,"Rhea: You're here, Mother..."
11455,"Together, the people of Fódlan relish the beauty of the brilliant moon overhead as another year ends. They recall sad partings and new acquaintances alike, but each person must still walk their chosen path alone. With each day, the presence of spring grows stronger and yet a lone moon still haunts the sky. A silent reminder, perhaps, of some inescapable truth...

"
11505,"In Imperial Year 1181, the New Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial Army. But amidst the chaos of battle, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of Fódlan has begun.
"
11506,Rhea: Unforgivable! I cannot believe that the Adrestian Empire would embark on such a violent course of action.
11507,Seteth: The fault is my own. I failed to see the wickedness within Edelgard's heart.
11508,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?
Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
11509,"Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
11510,"Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
11511,"Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
11512,"Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
11513,Seteth: Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know. Perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the Church of Seiros...
11514,Rhea: Adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle. To injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten. We must stop the Empire...and quickly.
11515,"Shamir: I have returned, Rhea."
11516,"Rhea: Welcome back, Shamir. Were you able to discern the Empire's movements?"
11517,Shamir: Their main troops are marching towards Garreg Mach. It is said that they will join forces with Edelgard's army and arrive within two weeks.
11518,Seteth: Two weeks? That is not enough time! It will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then. We must send notice to all surrounding villages at once. We must order the residents of Garreg Mach to flee for their lives.
11519,Shamir: It will be done.
11520,"Rhea: ...Professor...listen closely. If our enemy invades the monastery, I will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield. If something happens to me...I am entrusting my sacred duties to you."
11521,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why me?
Choice 2: Sacred duties?"
11522,Choice 1: Why me?
11523,Choice 2: Sacred duties?
11524,"Rhea: You must have guessed it by now. The truth of who you are. Or perhaps I should say, your lost memories are surely beginning to return. I have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you. But the duty is yours and yours alone. Only you can lead the people of Fódlan."
11525,"Seteth: ...Rhea, please. You must tell me all that you know. I beg of you."
11526,Rhea: ...
11527,Seteth: That one...is the progenitor god. Am I correct?
11528,"Rhea: In a sense. Our dear professor is...a vessel. One who carries the power of the progenitor god within. In time, the vessel will become one with the power contained within, and the progenitor god shall return to this world."
11529,Seteth: I see. I trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment? But I suppose there is no turning back...
11530,"Rhea: I ask that you help our friend...and in doing so, help her. I am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more."
11531,"Seteth: I am sorry, but I cannot do this. I am not certain it is just..."
11532,Rhea: I see. That is a shame.
11533,"Seteth: I understand. As ever, I will take you at your word."
11534,Flayn: Lady Rhea! Brother! I will do my part as well!
11535,"Seteth: Flayn! Were you eavesdropping? Regardless, I am glad to hear it. You owe your life to the professor, after all. And in the end, they may prove to be our brethren."
11536,"Rhea: You have my gratitude, Seteth. And you as well, Flayn. As followers of the progenitor god, it is up to us to see our mission through."
11537,Byleth: ...
11538,Dimitri: ... I'll have that girl's head. Just you wait...
11539,"Claude: The Empire is moving quickly. Edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now. If you really think about it, she must have been planning for this even before you got the Sword of the Creator... Of course she was always a step ahead of us. We were blinded by the ball and the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, and everything else..."
11540,"Ferdinand: Half of the Empire's six great noble families have declared their support for Edelgard. Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard. And my father...he was stripped of his role as prime minister. As as result, House Aegir has lost all of its power, all of its land. We have lost everything. I...I... What do I do?"
11541,"Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing..."
11542,"Caspar: I don't normally have a problem jumping into a fight, but it feels strange going up against my father. We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! I hope he's not part of the group coming to attack Garreg Mach..."
11543,"Bernadetta: What does war with Edelgard mean for us, Professor? And why does she even want that?"
11544,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her.
Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that..."
11545,"Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
11546,"Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
11547,"Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that..."
11548,Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that...
11549,"That's how it always goes, I guess. You never realize something can't be undone until you've done it."
11550,"Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win..."
11551,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Us or her, you mean?
Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?
Choice 2: We will not lose. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out..."
11552,"Choice 1: Us or her, you mean?
Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?"
11553,Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?

11555,"Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out..."
11556,Petra: I am owing big debts to Duke Gerth of the Empire. He is the Minister of Affairs that are Foreign. He is a friend of Edelgard. He is to her side. What should I be doing?
11557,"Petra: I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision...no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead."
11558,"Dedue: His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard. For me, that is cause enough to fight."
11559,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
Choice 2: You're truly all right with that? (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant."
11560,"Choice 1: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now."
11561,Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.

11563,Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant.
11564,"Dedue: And if Edelgard was responsible in any way for the Tragedy of Duscur, that is something I cannot ignore. If that is the case, then she is my enemy."
11565,"Felix: You saw it too, didn't you? The boar's true nature. He's hidden his desire for revenge pretty well. But now it's stirred up. Well, regardless. That girl's starting an all-out war, isn't she? But an enemy is an enemy, no matter who they are. Don't let compassion for her get in your way."
11566,"Annette: Once the Imperial army reaches the monastery, we'll have no choice but to fight..."

Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
11572,"Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
11573,Sylvain: Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it. Why did Edelgard make enemies with the nobles?
11574,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have no idea. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Me either... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?
Choice 2: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
11575,"Choice 1: I have no idea. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Me either... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?"
11576,"Sylvain: Me either... Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?"

11578,"Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
11579,Sylvain: I hope this all gets sorted out quickly and safely. I'm worried about my father.
11580,"Mercedes: I guess we have no choice but to fight, have we? Oh, but why would Edelgard do something like this? I'm sure we'll be all right though, Professor. The goddess will keep us safe."
11581,"Ingrid: I've known His Highness since I was a child, but I've never seen that side of him before. He seemed like a completely different person than the one I know..."
11582,"Lorenz: The Empire's aggression cannot stand. But if we are going to attack them now, we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success. It goes without saying that I will fight the Imperial army with everything I have, for as long as I am able. But House Gloucester's territory is adjacent to Imperial lands. Let us proceed with caution."
11583,"Raphael: I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys! If the Alliance is in danger, that means my sister's in danger too! There's no way I'm gonna allow that. It doesn't matter how many guys they throw at us, I'll beat 'em all! These muscles aren't just for show! But first, I gotta get some food."
11584,"Ignatz: You know, Professor, I'm glad that I came to the Officers Academy. I feel accepted here. I've learned so much. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much I've grown. So, I will not let the academy be destroyed. It's important to me, and I will protect it!"
11585,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor.
Choice 2: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
11586,"Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor."
11587,"Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor."
11588,"Choice 2: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
11589,"Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
11590,"Ignatz: We're gonna win this, Professor!"
11591,"Lysithea: So Edelgard, the one who calls herself the Flame Emperor, was connected to those strange beings. The Imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know. You had better be cautious, Professor. Any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing."
11592,"Marianne: Can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs? I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I..."
11593,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?
Choice 2: We can't win if you run. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!"
11594,"Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?"
11595,"Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?"
11596,"Choice 2: We can't win if you run. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!"
11597,Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!
11598,"Hilda: You'll battle Edelgard, right? Good luck! Me? Oh, I'm going to run away. I have zero interest in dying here, thank you very much."
11599,"Hilda: At times like this, I just feel so anxious, you know? But you'll watch out for me there. Right, Professor?"
11600,Leonie: What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it.
11601,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept."
11602,Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
11603,Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept.
11604,"Leonie: I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you."
11605,"Rhea: How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side. Please try to listen carefully for her voice..."
11606,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I will try. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Choice 2: I can't hear a thing.
Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time."
11607,Choice 1: I will try. (Relationship with Rhea up)
11608,"Choice 2: I can't hear a thing.
Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time."
11609,Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time.
11610,Rhea: May the goddess's voice reach you...
11611,Seteth: We must protect Garreg Mach. Defiling the Holy Tomb was a sacrilege. I will not allow such a thing to happen again. The archbishop has already given you a new responsibility. I want you to rise to that honor.
11612,"Flayn: Professor... War is breaking out again, is it not?"
11613,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time.
Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?"
11614,"Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
11615,"Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
11616,"Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?"
11617,Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?
11618,Flayn: I never wanted another war... All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead.
11619,"Alois: Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle. We're depending on your strength, Professor. Crush our enemies!"
11620,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'll try
Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)"
11621,Choice 1: I'll try
11622,Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)
11623,"Alois: Captain, I hope you're watching! We will protect Garreg Mach!"
11624,"Catherine: Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's..."
11625,"Shamir: We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor. To think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses... However hard we fight, I give us a 50 percent chance of winning. The enemy has too many advantages. We must make careful preparations."
11626,"Gilbert: There are always small power struggles, still... It has been hundreds of years since all of Fódlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this... I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should... Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland... To the land of my king."
11627,"Hanneman: The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place... But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet... I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well... And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts... Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!"
11628,"Manuela: The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess... Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe..."
11629,"Cyril: It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all..."
11630,Anna: I can't believe the Empire raised an army... Even I couldn't have guessed it. War is profitable...but dangerous. I really don't like seeing people I care about out there mixed up in all this.
11631,"Gatekeeper: Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive... Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!"
11632,"Knight of Seiros: I cannot believe our negligence allowed the Empire to invade. Edelgard probably gathered her soldiers in Garreg Mach, intending to do this from the start. Soldiers disguised as merchants and pilgrims to avoid suspicion...infiltration the entire area little by little. They couldn't be better prepared. We'll have a tough time winning this one, I'm afraid."
11633,Student: Professor! What actually happened last month? I can't keep up at all. Edelgard is the emperor? And she's declared war against the church? So now we're at war?! WHAT is going on? I really don't understand any of this... What should I do?
11634,"Student: I thought we'd all be really busy with assignments and getting ready for graduation. But now... Now that things have turned out like this, I guess there's nothing to do but fight..."
11635,Monk: Those who serve the church must cast aside all selfish desires and devote themselves fully to their beliefs. But is it right to wield piety as a weapon? I...have never considered such things before. The church... I... I have always done what I thought best to save the people of Fódlan...
11636,"Monk: How dare they threaten the goddess! Such a vile act cannot be forgiven! There is no need to worry, I promise you that. Divine punishment will surely fall upon them. In the days of yore, the goddess would grow angry with such insolent fools and roast them in Ailell..."
11637,"Yuri: So this is how it's turned out. I figured as much, but I didn't anticipate it would happen so soon. If Garreg Mach becomes a battlefield, Abyss will have no choice but to get involved. Everyone here will have no alternative. They've got nowhere else to go."
11638,"Balthus: I could smell a war brewing, and sure enough, here we are. Hmm... If Fódlan falls onto chaos, I wonder if my debts will fall away along with it... Heh, just thinking aloud here. If the Empire wants a fight, let's give 'em one to remember!"
11639,It shakes me to my core that the Empire would lash out so violently. I shall have to reconsider my intended path towards restoring House Nuvelle.
11640,"Hapi: People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and nobles clashing over territory. Things like that. So before the war, when folks talked about how peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent are you living on?"" I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there are nothing compared to a full-blown war. The one truly peaceful place I've known was the village where I grew up."
11641,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Aww, guess who was worried about Abyss and came by to check on me. I mean, on us. Isn't that nice? That's just...so nice."
11642,Knight of Seiros: My pleasure. Surely the church can spare one knight to help you watch over this place.
11643,"Abysskeeper: I'm not crying! I'm just...just don't worry about it, OK?! Move it along!"
11644,"Rogue: War's actually coming, isn't it? Unbelievable. Imperial troops in Garreg Mach? It's gonna be wild. Whatever happens won't affect us down here in Abyss, though... Will it?"
11645,"Magic Wielder: This might be our last chance to get out of here. I'm leaving Garreg Mach. You should too. Protect the students? Have you got a death wish?! All right, all right. Uh, take this...and try not to get killed."
11646,"Seteth: We have been scouting the makeup of the Imperial army, but much is still unclear. Any information you could provide would be a great help"
11647,"Seteth: Interesting… It's true that a lot more people have been coming and going as of late. Hmm, perhaps we could secure new information if we capture someone from the Imperial army. Thank you. That is quite helpful."
11648,"Alois: Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us. If you can fight, pick up a weapon! Everyone else, hurry up and evacuate! We have the goddess's protection on our side. We have nothing to fear. Victory will be ours!"
11649,Catherine: Professor. Are you ready?
11650,Byleth: Almost.
11651,"Catherine: Well, hurry up. I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard. Do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are."
11652,Dimitri: They're here. At long last.
11653,Felix: It seems this will be a battle to remember. About time.
11654,"Ashe: I'll never give up, no matter how outnumbered we are. I'll fight to the very end!"
11655,"Sylvain: Hm, I should have made a move on the Imperial princess before things got this far. It could have changed everything."
11656,Mercedes: We have the goddess's divine protection on our side. All that's left to do is to try our best.
11657,"Annette: All we can do is fight as best as we can. Though...if I'm being honest, I'm really scared right now..."
11658,"Ingrid: We can't just hand over the Kingdom and the monastery. We'll stop her, no matter what it takes!"
11659,"Dedue: Your Highness, you do not seem...well."
11660,"Dimitri: (In an insane tone) (chuckles deliriously) Unwell, you say? What's gotten into you? Nothing could be further from the truth. I'm so happy I can hardly contain myself. My father, my stepmother, my dear friends? They want her head. They want her life! They've whispered as much to me. And the chance to answer their pleas has arrived, at long last!
Choice 1: Don't lose control out there.
Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) I'm always in control, Professor! And I'll stay in control until I have the pleasure of killing that woman!
Choice 2: Don't act rashly. We're all in this together.
Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) Of course, of course! But don't mistake my intentions. Edelgard will die by my hand, and mine alone."
11661,"Choice 1: Don't lose control out there.
Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) I'm always in control, Professor! And I'll stay in control until I have the pleasure of killing that woman!"
11662,"Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) I'm always in control, Professor! And I'll stay in control until I have the pleasure of killing that woman!"
11663,"Choice 2: Don't act rashly. We're all in this together.
Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) Of course, of course! But don't mistake my intentions. Edelgard will die by my hand, and mine alone."
11664,"Dimitri: (in a maniacal tone) (Laughs dementedly) Of course, of course! But don't mistake my intentions. Edelgard will die by my hand, and mine alone."
11665,"Dimitri: Let's move, Professor. Even if it costs me my life, I won't rest until I've crushed her skull in my bare hands!"
11666,Suggested Level: 23
11667,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
11668,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle (classic mode), all of your units fall in battle (casual mode), Rhea falls in battle, or the defended location is captured."
11669,Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The enemy is within the walls. They're about to break the defensive line!
11670,Dedue: The archbishop and the defensive line both require our assistance. We must protect them until reinforcements get here.
11671,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading!
11672,Dedue: We must retake the strongholds to the east and west so our reinforcements can get through.
11673,Dedue: One stronghold secured.
11674,"Dedue: Both strongholds secured, with time to spare."
11675,"Catherine: I'm here, and I've brought reinforcements! Don't worry--we'll protect the monastery! (if Catherine was not recruited)"
11676,Shamir: I brought reinforcements. I'll send them to the front line. (if Shamir was not recruited)
11677,Dedue: They have taken the monastery. We have lost...
11678,Rhea: The goddess protects us... what is there to fear rebel swords... This is blasphemy against the goddess! Stop this now!
11679,Rhea: N-no... I cannot fall here...
11680,Randolph: A wonderful chance to earn some recognition! I'll be the one to take down the monastery!
11681,Caspar: Huh. This guy seems real familiar...
11682,Randolph: Y-you dastard! Aren't you... No...
11683,"Caspar: Eh, that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!"
11684,Randolph: I have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight!
11685,"Randolph: Argh! I'm finished. I'm loathe to say it, but I must retreat..."
11686,"Hubert: Lady Edelgard held you in such high esteem. In the end, however, it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess."
11687,"Hubert: Such a shame. There are people in the Empire you truly care about, too, aren't there? I wonder what will become of them."
11688,"Hubert: What you fail to appreciate is that we have, at our backs, a force you cannot hope to defeat."
11689,Hubert: I can afford to fall back. We still have the advantage.
11690,Death Knight: This battlefield is too chaotic... for us to kill each other upon...
11691,Death Knight: This fight is but a sideshow... to the ravaging of the sacred place that is Garreg Mach...
11692,Death Knight: The time is not right... I will wait for the next opportunity...
11693,Ladislava: I will not allow you to get any closer to Her Majesty!
11694,"Ladislava: My life was changed forever by Her Majesty... Now, I lay it on the line. For the Empire!"
11695,"Ladislava: Lady Edelgard, I'm so sorry! I can't keep going! I must retreat!"
11696,"Edelgard: I wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds. If it were so, I would have done anything to make you my ally..."
11697,"Dimitri: You're late. I... We are all tired of waiting. Now, let's separate that sick head from your neck, shall we?"
11698,Edelgard: Heh. You never were one for patience.
11699,"Edelgard: So, House Nuvelle has chosen the path that will lead to its ultimate demise. How pitiable."
11700,"Constance: As you say, I have forfeited my claim on being a noble of the Empire. That is why you must permit me to challenge you in combat, that I may establish a new House Nuvelle."
11701,Edelgard: As you wish. Let's see if your resolve is a match for my own.
11702,"Edelgard: Think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the Empire... or if you will offer it to us in fealty. And after you've thought it through, if you still wish to fight, I won't stop you. I will simply use the full extent of my power... and crush you."
11703,Edelgard: You will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the Adrestian Empire!
11704,"Edelgard: You fought well. But now, your fight is over. Send in our reserve troops! And give my uncle the signal!"
11705,Rhea: What... is this?!
11706,"Rhea: Everyone here, young and old, is in your hands."
11707,Rhea: No. I will not allow another Red Canyon tragedy to happen here.
11708,Claude: What is going on?
11709,Empire Soldier: What now?

11714,"It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at
Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of Fódlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factions–those who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgard's rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new Fódlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

11718,"In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former Kingdom–Houses Gautier and Fraldarius–struggle to continue the resistance. Cornelia–operating out of the royal palace–has accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.
"
11719,"In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empire’s supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Alliance’s adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.
"
11720,"In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western Fódlan.
"
11721,"In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin…and become a haven for thieves.

Like so much rain, a pool of blood has fallen to the ground… As spears and arrows pierce the earth, it weeps. And even now…it weeps. In order to survive, they kill.

11746,"Villager: Uh, yeah, that’s what I said. But with the war and the archbishop still missing and all… I doubt there’s a soul to be found who has enough blessings worth counting. Hey! Slow down, will ya? Where do you think you’re going?"
11747,Byleth: The monastery.
11748,"Villager: Are you crazy?! I told ya! They say thieves are running amok up there, and there’s plenty of other dangers too. I heard a rumor that Imperial troops went up there to investigate and got slaughtered. Every last one! Come on, I promise I won’t say you’re a coward. Just forget about going anywhere near the monastery."
11749,"Villager: You just remember I tried to stop you, got it? It’s not on my conscience if you wind up dead!"
11750,"Byleth:
Choice 1: My students are waiting for me.

11755,Dimitri: I should have known...that one day...you would be haunting me as well.
11756,"Dimitri: You... What must I do to be rid of you? I will kill that woman, I swear it. Do not look upon me with scorn in your eyes!"

Choice 2: Everything will be OK."
11758,Choice 1: What are you talking about?
11759,Choice 2: Everything will be OK.
11760,Dimitri: ... You... It can't be! You're alive?! Hmph. If that is the case... That can only mean you are another Imperial spy. Did you come here to kill me? Answer the question.
11761,Byleth: Of course not.
11762,Dimitri: Ungh...
11763,Byleth: I'm glad you're safe.
11764,Dimitri: Am I?
11765,Dimitri: ...
11766,Byleth: What have you been doing the last five years?
11767,"Dimitri: I have been dead, more or less."
11768,Byleth: Why do you say that?
11769,"Dimitri: What do you hope to gain, asking me that? There are more important matters at hand..."
11770,Byleth: ...
11771,"Dimitri: Do you not smell them? Filthy rats. Everywhere. And traces of those who were here long ago. And thieves, crawling from the woodwork, attracted by the promise of treasure. Heh… Since the monastery fell, order in the area fell right along with it. You must have seen the state of the town near Garreg Mach on your way here. Vile thieves run rampant. They pillage and loot to their heart’s content. I must kill them. Every last one. It’s time to hunt down their nest."
11772,Byleth: What do you plan to do?
11773,Dimitri: I told you. I will kill them all.

11779,"Dimitri: Someone must put a stop to this cycle of the strong trampling the weak. Or do you condone their actions? Do you believe that the pillaging and slaughtering those rats live for is justified?! It is reprehensible, and they must be put down! I intend to give them a taste of the pain they have inflicted on others. Even if it means becoming a rat myself. I swore to at least do that much… I will not let them down…"

11793,Dimitri: Shall we go rat hunting? Don't let a single vermin escape!
11794,Gilbert: His Highness! And... Professor? We must speak later.
11795,"Ashe: I know it's been five years, but I never expected the monastery to end up like this."
11796,Mercedes: Oh! I haven't seen any of you in such a long time! I'm so glad to see you're alive.
11797,"Annette: We'll help out from here! It's over, thieves!"
11798,Dimitri: Why... Why are you here?
11799,Sylvain: The monastery has become a nest of thieves.
11800,Ingrid: Professor! You're alive after all! But first things first–let's defeat these thieves.
11801,Felix: I'll lend a hand. We'll catch up later.
11802,Dimitri: Listen up. We must end this quickly.
11803,Dimitri: There are openings to the north and south. We'll split into two and tear them apart.
11804,Ashe: We promised five years ago we'd meet here and now!
11805,Mercedes: Getting to see you and everyone else again makes having to leave my family feel less difficult.
11806,"Annette: Long time no see, Professor! I always knew in my heart that we'd meet again!"
11807,"Sylvain: Where have you been the last five years? I was worried about you, and then I was just sad."
11808,"Sylvain: Professor! Has it really been five years? You're as pretty as ever, and that's the only thing that matters."
11809,"Ingrid: I'm glad we could meet again, Professor. It'll be nice to fight alongside each other. Just like old times."
11810,Felix: Fancy meeting you here. A welcome surprise.
11811,Pallardó: No! I'm not the one you want! Gah! I guess I've got no choice.
11812,Pallardó: It isn't looking good for us. Should we retreat?
11813,"Dimitri: You didn't plan on letting him get away, did you?"
11814,"Pallardó: Ah, you should yield me a tidy profit!"
11815,Pallardó: I have no longer any reason to be here. Good-bye and be well!
11816,"Dimitri: Damn it, we failed to kill him..."
11817,Pallardó: I thought it would be easy money... Maybe it wasn't...meant to be...
11818,Dimitri: ...
11819,Ingrid: Your Highness! Professor! I'm so glad you're both safe...
11820,Dimitri: Why are you here?
11821,Ashe: Did you forget? We all made a promise here on this very day five years ago.
11822,"Mercedes: Dimitri, weren't you the one who asked that we all meet up here?"
11823,"Annette: Don't be silly! Of course you remember our promise. That's why you and the professor are here, right?"
11824,Gilbert: Your Highness... I have been following news of your whereabouts for a while now. I am relieved to have finally found you.
11825,"Dimitri: Do not call me that. I am not a prince, but a walking corpse."
11826,Byleth: Why would you say that?
11827,"Gilbert: That is what we all believed, but it is not so. I can see with my own eyes that you are alive, Your Highness. But the jail cells in Fhirdiad are as solid as they come. How did you manage to…"
11828,Dimitri: Dedue.
11829,Byleth: What happened?
11830,Dimitri: He's dead. He died in my place.
11831,"Gilbert: I see. We will be sure to honor his loyalty, Your Highness. As for the state of the Kingdom, the lords from the western regions have declared their fealty to the Empire, starting with House Rowe. Cornelia’s band of traitors now refers to Kingdom territory as the Faerghus Dukedom. They’ve made Fhirdiad their stronghold as they continue to invade the eastern region."
11832,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Traitors?
Gilbert: There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time.
Choice 2: Cornelia?
Gilbert: She is a mage who has served in the royal family for more than 20 years. There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time."
11833,"Choice 1: Traitors?
Gilbert: There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time."
11834,Gilbert: There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time.
11835,"Choice 2: Cornelia?
Gilbert: She is a mage who has served in the royal family for more than 20 years. There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time."
11836,Gilbert: She is a mage who has served in the royal family for more than 20 years. There is much to tell you. I will explain everything in time.
11837,"Sylvain: Well, it’s not like all of the Kingdom’s lords have sided with the Empire. There are plenty of houses, like mine and Felix’s, that remain stubbornly opposed."
11838,"Gilbert: Your Highness. Please allow us to take up arms at your side once more. What we need more than anything isn’t soldiers, money or supplies. We need the legitimate heir of Faerghus to overthrow the Empire and reclaim the Kingdom! Such is your duty. It is yours alone to bear and well worth fighting for. Only you can gather our troops and lead us back into the light."
11839,"Byleth: You are still needed, Dimitri."
11840,"Dimitri: I see. So, you all agree that we must fight back. And you see how that woman…how the Empire cannot be forgiven. That we must wipe them all out until not a single one of them remains…"
11841,"Annette: Wipe them all out? Umm, I don’t think any of us here are suggesting anything that extreme…"
11842,Gilbert: … Professor… There is something I would like to ask you. Please join me inside the monastery.
11843,"Gilbert: To think you survived under all that rubble for the past five years... I suppose stranger things have happened, odd as that is to admit. There is still much I would like to ask you... But I think that's enough for now."
11844,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is Rhea safe?
Choice 2: Where are the Knights of Seiros?"
11845,Choice 1: Is Rhea safe?
11846,Choice 2: Where are the Knights of Seiros?
11847,"Gilbert: On that day five years ago, during the battle with the Imperial army, Lady Rhea went missing. Since then, the Knights of Seiros have continued searching for her…and for you. I hear they have yet to find any promising leads. As the Empire has yet to release a statement, it’s hard to imagine that she has perished. And yet… Ah, never mind. Once news of your survival gets out, everyone will flock back to the monastery."
11848,Byleth: What happened to the Kingdom?
11849,"Gilbert: After that battle, a certain...incident took place in Fhirdiad. Rufus, who was serving as king regent, was murdered. I was once a knight in service of the royal family… I resigned from the Knights of Seiros, and returned to serve the Kingdom. However…"
11850,Gilbert: This is madness! You truly claim that His Highness is the one who killed Rufus?
11851,"Cornelia: Oh, but it’s true. The only one who could slip past the bodyguards and kill so efficiently is the young prince. You can’t deny it."
11852,Gilbert: Rufus is Prince Dimitri’s uncle! His Highness is incapable of such an atrocious crime as murdering his own blood!
11853,"Cornelia: Ah, but they were never very close, were they? It’s a well-known fact amongst former retainers. There are even rumors that Rufus was originally involved in the Tragedy of Duscur… Perhaps His Highness believed those rumors and murdered Rufus in a fit of rage. But I’m afraid none of that matters now."
11854,Gilbert: Cornelia. Do not tell me that you...
11855,"Cornelia: The decision has been made. His Highness will pay for his crime with his head. His sentence will be carried out the day after tomorrow. On that day, the royal bloodline will come to an end. All you have left to do is sit back and watch, you senile old fool. Watch as the Kingdom you love falls to ashes."
11856,"Gilbert: It was soon after announced that his sentence had been carried out. With His Highness’s death, the royal bloodline of House Blaiddyd was erased from this world. True to her word, all we could do was watch as she tore the Kingdom apart before our eyes. Since the execution and the prince’s corpse were concealed from the public, there have always been those who believed His Highness was still alive… As for myself, I only began to hope three years ago, when I chanced upon some compelling rumors…"
11857,Byleth: What rumors?
11858,"Gilbert: An Imperial platoon attacked without warning. Incident after incident of Imperial generals being slaughtered in Kingdom territory. It is said that each died in such a brutal, gruesome way that…it is hard to imagine they were killed by human hands. I followed the rumors to location after location. Eventually, I had seen enough. I knew the rumors were true. Finally, after a half decade of torment, it happened. I found him… I fear his deep hatred, and the weight of his solitude, have consumed him for far too long… We must bring him back from the edge on which he stands. To that end, I must speak with His Highness. I imagine it will not be a quick or easy conversation. I pray that he is of a mind to speak of such things. I am certain that my words will… Never mind. What must be done, must be done. I would wager that you are weary after the day’s events. Perhaps you should take this opportunity to get some rest."

11913,"Alois: Ah, thank the goddess... I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you."
11914,Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
11915,Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But...I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
11916,"Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor."

11927,"Gilbert: We'll make Garreg Mach our base, and prepare to make our stand against the Empire. There is a fair amount of damage, but we will at least have shelter from the wind and rain."
11928,"Catherine: Surely those Imperial jerks have this place staked out, right? It's a highly strategic location."
11929,"Gilbert: While it may be a strategic location, it's too far from the front lines to be worthy of notice at the moment. This area is inconvenient as far as transport time is concerned, so it's of little importance to their war effort."
11930,"Seteth: Even so, nothing slips past the emperor. It is safe to assume she at least has this place under surveillance."
11931,Gilbert: Professor... What do you think about making this place our base?

11939,"Sylvain: She's right. In fact, why don't we all join forces and clean this place up a bit?"
11940,"Annette: Ooh, yeah! That's a great idea! And it'll give us time to reminisce about all the good old days at the academy. I can't wait!"
11941,Dimitri: How carefree of you.
11942,"Ashe: It may sound trivial, but... Well, I think it's a good idea..."

11952,Mercedes: I feel so bad for him... Would it help if I brewed him a nice pot of tea?

11970,"Sylvain: Hey, Professor. It's been a while. It's really good to see you again. Gorgeous as ever, might I add. An awful lot has happened in these past five years. There were so many times I wished you were around. I'm glad you're back. Your skills are worth more than a whole army."

11978,Mercedes: Oh! I should invite Dimitri to come along as well. Though I don't suppose he'll want to join in...
11979,"Annette: Now that I think about it, His Highness was right. We probably don't have time to waste on cleaning... Maybe I wasn't taking the situation seriously enough. After all, the Imperial army could be showing up at any time! I was just so happy to see you again. And everyone else too. Maybe I got carried away."

11985,"Ingrid: These past five years, many Kingdom houses have become vassals of the Empire. The major houses of Fraldarius, Gautier, Charon, and my own family, Galatea, remain loyal... But the lords of the minor domains in the west have almost entirely defected. After all the royal family has done for them, they respond with betrayal. And to think they have the gall to call themselves nobles. But we still have His Highness, and you, Professor. I'm sure we can take back the Kingdom's lands."
11986,"Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life. I have turned my blade against her now. I cannot go back on that decision. Professor... Do you think I chose the wrong path?"
11987,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not at all.
Choice 2: We'll find out soon enough. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)"

11990,Ferdinand: You are right...
11991,"Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather impressed by how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon."
11992,"Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and the Alliance. Then I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!"
11993,"Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?"
11994,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry.
Bernadetta: Oh! Forget you heard anything!
Choice 2: Hear what? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)

11999,"Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history."
12000,"Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be...difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means that common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will...ah, will turn. I have certainty."
12001,Raphael: The Alliance is such a mess. How are we supposed to know where's safe and where's not? I should probably just move my little sis and grandpa to Garreg Mach. At least I could keep working on becoming a proper knight without having to worry about them! I gotta find them a house once things calm down a bit!
12002,"Ignatz: Oh, Professor! Seeing everyone together again, it's like I'm in a dream. I feel like it's time for me to forge my own path and find my own place in this world."
12003,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What about your family? Are they OK?
Ignatz: Yes. They're in the Alliance, but they're merchants, so they have the means to escape if need be.
Choice 2: How does your father feel about all this? (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I sent him a letter. I'm still waiting on a reply, but I don't think he'd object to my being here. It'll be valuable for him, having someone outside the Alliance to keep him abreast of new information."

12008,"Lysithea: I should probably keep things to myself, but in all honesty... What matters to me, more than anything, is ensuring a peaceful, quiet future for my parents. I don't care about the Kingdom. I simply want to remove the threat of the Empire. Because of this, Dimitri's fixation on Edelgard is convenient to me. I fight for my own reasons and no others."
12009,"Marianne: Professor... Is there any reason for me to remain here? I want to be useful, of course, but I'm not sure anyone needs me."
12010,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Then why did you stay?

12015,"Hilda: Garreg Mach is a mess. So is Dimitri, honestly. If not for you arriving, Professor, I'd be heading home about now. Though staying here is still more appealing than living with my big brother."
12016,"Leonie: I'm so glad I found you here, Professor. Now I don't have to worry about what to do with myself. Captain Jeralt told me to look out for you, after all. So now my purpose is clear. I'll do everything I can to protect you!"
12017,"Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It is a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea."

12024,"Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail."
12025,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)

12031,"Gilbert: We have given a proper burial to the Imperial soldiers kills in the monastery. The ones who were sent to investigate the thieves. Already, rumors spread that they were utterly annihilated. So regardless of whether there are spies observing us, the Imperial army will know of this soon enough. Your Highness...Dimitri... How could you be so reckless?"

Choice 1: That's fine. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.

12043,"Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
12044,Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.
12045,"Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back."
12046,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
12047,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again. I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!"
12048,"Soldier: In the Alliance, the lords have been at odds, so peace and prosperity have declined there as well. In particular, bandits have been appearing in large numbers near the Great Bridge of Myrddin. Rumor has it that the domain's lord, someone by the name of Acheron, is a completely ineffectual leader..."
12049,"Knight of Seiros: During the millennium festival, the leaders of all territories were supposed to gather together and pledge perpetual peace. But now that hope has been dashed, thanks to the emperor's actions. The Alliance is also divided on the subject of the Empire, so internal conflicts are a regular occurrence."
12050,"Knight of Seiros: During the search for Her Grace, the archbishop, Seteth has visited churches all across the land. It served to demonstrate to the devout across Fódlan that the Church of Seiros is still going strong. As a result, the faithful are not currently in a state of chaos."
12051,"Knight of Seiros: It seems that in the last five years, the monks here have left this place for the town below. However, once they learn of our return, perhaps they'll come back. I hope the monastery can return to normal some day..."
12052,"Yuri: You've been snoozing awhile, so allow me to fill you in. There's a madman roaming Faerghus. Imperial troops entering Kingdom settlements are destroyed seemingly overnight. Townspeople on the front lines are terrified, and yet they simultaneously treat this as though he's some sort of hero blazing through the land. Can't imagine their surprise when they realized it was their own prince."
12053,"Balthus: These past five years have been so chaotic, even the bounty hunters backed off. I kinda miss the chase. I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal."
12054,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Balthus up)

12059,"Balthus: If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse, think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp."

12061,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you sure?
Constance: I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough. I recommend that you accept my generous offer.

12065,Constance: Your quick acceptance of the truth is gratifying.
12066,Constance: But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.
12067,"Hapi: You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long. I thought you might have died. But I didn't have anywhere else to go, so...I stayed here."
12068,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
12069,"Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you."
12070,Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
12071,"Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
12072,Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy.
12073,"Hapi: I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed, we've lost a few people down here."
12074,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years, hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard. That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in and day out. Not like I have anywhere else to be. Seems to me things are pretty tough up top, anyhow. These days, it's probably cozier down here than it is up there. How's that for a change of pace?"
12075,Rogue: A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started. People are saying it was the church that used to keep order around here. But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.
12076,"Gilbert: Professor, might I ask you to help us secure resources?"
12077,"Gilbert: I thank you for procuring resources. This isn't much, but please accept it along with my gratitude"
12078,"Soldier: The fish seem skittish lately... It's said that every five years, in the wake of a storm, a mystery fish appears and eats up all of the other fish in the pond. They call it the Big One. I thought that it was just a legend though."
12079,"Soldier: You got rid of the Big One! Now the other fish can rest easy. Assuming fish rest... Anyway, nice work."
12080,Soldier: Some soldiers stationed at Fódlan's Locket abandoned their posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks. It would be a real headache for us if they became bandits and started wreaking havoc in the towns.
12081,"Soldier: I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those Fódlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little intervention, they've changed their tune and are back on our side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line."
12082,"Soldier: Recently, pirates have been raiding coastal towns in the Sreng Region. People say that they're attacking innocent civilians and sinking merchant ships. Think you can do something about that?"
12083,Soldier: Nice work out there! Some mercenaries heard news of your valiant leadership and have come to the monastery to offer their services.
12084,"Merchant: I want to start a collection that chronicles the history of Fódlan, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on anything significant. Honestly, it might be easier to excavate an artifact rather than trying to find one for sale..."
12085,"Merchant: Ah, magnificent! Exactly what I was looking for. Clearly I asked the right person for help."
12086,Balthus: It seems some villages out near Fódlan's Throat have been having some trouble with thieves lately. Holst asked for help dealing with the problem. You mind coming along?
12087,"Balthus: Sorry for dragging you along on that, pal. But hey, would you like to meet Holst sometime? I think he's really interested in you. Maybe we all can meet up the next time we're in his neck of the woods?"
12088,"Hapi: A fortune-teller recently set up shop in Abyss. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, why not drop by?"
12089,"Hapi: So you talked to the wayseer. huh? That kinda thing's not really for me. If she told me something good, I'd get my hopes up, and if she told me something bad, I'd get upset. But I'm glad you got something out of it."
12090,Scholar: It seems a list of rare books that the Church of Seiros does not make publicly available has turned up in Abyss. If you could somehow get your hands on that list...
12091,"Scholar: Thank you. Here, I've made a copy. Perhaps the books included in the list will be of use to you as well. I wonder what you'll find if you search the archives in Abyss..."
12092,Dimitri: You're wrong.
12093,Byleth: ...
12094,"Dimitri: It's not like that, Glenn. I swear it. Any love I once had for my stepsister...has been tossed aside. Only hatred remains. If I could tear that woman to shreds right this very moment, I would. I don't care if she's the emperor. It's no different than killing anyone else. So I beg you...all of you... Do not worry about my resolve. Please, Father... And you too, Stepmother... Do not gaze at me with that look in your eyes... I will bring you her head soon. And when I do, you may finally rest in peace. I know it... Yes, I know it..."

12100,Choice 1: I came to check on you.
12101,Choice 2: Everyone is worried about you.
12102,Dimitri: I see. We should make haste and prepare to move out at once. I must kill her as soon as possible...
12103,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That would be rash.
Dimitri: (turns towards Byleth) I don't have time to leisurely set up camp like the rest of you fools!
Choice 2: We must first prepare.
Dimitri: (turns towards Byleth) We have no time to leisurely set up camp. If I must, I will go by myself."

12107,"Dimitri: (turns towards Byleth) We have no time to leisurely set up camp. If I must, I will go by myself."
12108,"Gilbert: Pardon the interruption. We must prepare a counterattack at once. The Imperial army has caught wind of our position. It would seem they were patrolling this place, after all."
12109,"Dimitri: The Imperial army, is it? Well, well. Hehehe..."
12110,Gilbert: Your Highness... I ask that you please refrain from reckless behavior in battle.
12111,Randolph: It would seem the report that the Knights of Seiros have returned was accurate. This is going to take some effort.
12112,Fleche: Brother... I heard a rumor that there is a vicious murderer among our enemies.
12113,"Randolph: Who knows if there's any truth to it. Thought I admit we have lost some soldiers recently. Whether he's among them or not, taking on the Knights of Seiros is extremely dangerous. You're not ready for the front lines, Fleche. Stay in the back and support us from there. Understood?"
12114,Fleche: No! I want to stay with you! I have to–
12115,"Randolph: I need you to understand, Fleche. I will come back. I promise."
12116,"Fleche: Fine. I trust you, Brother. Please...be safe."
12117,"Randolph: All units, prepare to attack!"
12118,Suggested Level: 27
12119,Victory Conditions: Rout the enemy.
12120,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle (classic), all of your units fall in battle (casual), or a defended location is captured."
12121,"Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!"
12122,Gilbert: There are more enemies than expected. Attacking with fire would prove most useful here.
12123,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
12124,"Gilbert: If they reach the interior, we won't be able to protect the monastery. Drive them back!"
12125,Gilbert: It is our duty to give these soldiers to their destination. Stay alert. An attack may come at any time.
12126,Gilbert: Damn! We couldn't protect the monastery. We must accept defeat.
12127,Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
12128,Dimitri: Professor! Get down!
12129,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
12130,Gilbert: The fire attack unit has been destroyed. Our plan has failed.
12131,"Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!"
12132,"Gilbert: Fire attack is ready. Now to draw the enemy's attention. So many units, and you still can't defeat us... The Empire's generals are not as formidable as I'd heard."
12133,Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
12134,Gilbert: Now!
12135,Imperial soldier: Fire! Gyaaaaaah!
12136,"Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!"
12137,Gilbert: Chase them down! Leave none standing. Eliminate them before they can regroup.
12138,"Randolph: A one-eyed demon... So, it's you. You're the one who's been going around killing the Imperial troops!"
12139,Dimitri: What is it to you?
12140,"Randolph: You bastard! Life is worthless to you, isn't it?!"
12141,"Dimitri: Ha! You took the words from my mouth, general!"
12142,Caspar: You must be Randolph... My uncle.
12143,"Randolph: Caspar?! Yes, indeed... So, I see you have chosen to oppose the Empire. If so, be warned that I won't hesitate. I'll strike you down, even if we're of the same house!"
12144,Caspar: You took the words right outta my mouth! Graaagh!
12145,Randolph: For my house! For justice! I will not be defeated!
12146,Randolph: No... This can't end here...
12147,Dimitri: Capture him.
12148,"Gilbert: A terrible battle, yet Garreg Mach still stands. Your Highness?"
12149,Randolph: I have family waiting for me... Please. I can't die here...
12150,"Dimitri: A beast of your depravity, prattling on about family? How amusing."
12151,Randolph: As though you could understand...such a thing as love... You heartless monster!
12152,"Dimitri: You are a monster too, General. You have just yet to realize it. A monster who thinks he's a man...despicable. As a general, you must have killed countless souls without a shred of mercy. Do you still remember the sound of them begging, just as you're begging now? Or, now that your life is at its end, will you hold to the lie that your hands are not stained red with blood?"
12153,Randolph: This...this is war. I did what I had to for the Empire...for the people...for my family!
12154,"Dimitri: So, you are piling up corpses for the people and for your family. And I am doing the same for the salvation of the dead... After all is said and done, we are both murderers. Both stained. Both monsters."
12155,Randolph: You're wrong!
12156,"Dimitri: Am I? I can smell the rotting flesh upon your hands even now, General."
12157,Randolph: Enough! That's enough!
12158,"Dimitri: I won't kill you right away, my fellow monster. Unless you object to watching your friends die. One...by...one. If so, I will do you the service of removing your eyes first so that–"
12159,"Randolph: Gaaah! Fleche... Please, forgive me..."
12160,Dimitri: ... What is the meaning of this?
12161,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I couldn't bear to watch.
Dimitri: Hah...hahahaha! A grievous error, Professor!
Choice 2: I miss the Dimitri I once knew.
Dimitri: The Dimitri you once knew is dead. All that remains is the repulsive, blood-stained monster you see before you."
12162,"Choice 1: I couldn't bear to watch.
Dimitri: Hah...hahahaha! A grievous error, Professor!"
12163,"Dimitri: Hah...hahahaha! A grievous error, Professor!"
12164,"Choice 2: I miss the Dimitri I once knew.
Dimitri: The Dimitri you once knew is dead. All that remains is the repulsive, blood-stained monster you see before you."
12165,"Dimitri: The Dimitri you once knew is dead. All that remains is the repulsive, blood-stained monster you see before you."
12166,"Dimitri: If you do not approve of what I have become, then kill me. If you insist that you cannot...then I will continue to use you and your friends until the flesh falls from your bones."
12167,"Gilbert: We managed to repel the Imperial army, but we remain divided on our next course of action. I anticipate a second and third wave of attack... With our current forces, we'll have our hands full just defending."
12168,Sylvain: It's a miracle we managed to repel the Imperial army with the few units and resources we do have.
12169,Annette: We should probably contact Rodrigue right away to request backup.
12170,"Gilbert: Rodrigue is in a difficult position, as he has suffered invasions by the Dukedom. But there are troops who share in our cause gathering the heart of Fraldarius territory. If we can arrange for them to join us, our forces will grow considerably."
12171,"Dimitri: Fraldarius... So, Rodrigue is still alive, is he?"
12172,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We met five years ago.
Dimitri: So you did.
Choice 2: That name sounds familiar.
Dimitri: You met Rodrigue when he visited the monastery during Miklan's rebellion."
12173,"Choice 1: We met five years ago.
Dimitri: So you did."
12174,Dimitri: So you did.
12175,"Choice 2: That name sounds familiar.
Dimitri: You met Rodrigue when he visited the monastery during Miklan's rebellion."
12176,Dimitri: You met Rodrigue when he visited the monastery during Miklan's rebellion.
12177,Felix: I wonder what my old man will say when he sees you now. That spectacle alone will be worth the trip.
12178,Dimitri: Hmph.
12179,"Gilbert: I've already sent word with our fastest messenger informing Rodrigue that His Highness is alive. But we'd do well to send another in case anything happens to the first. With the current state of things, we'll be completely helpless without his support. Your Highness, may I ask what your next plan of attack is? Should we dispatch our troops to the Kingdom capital or to the Imperial capital?"
12180,"Dimitri: We will take the Imperial capital. There, I will kill her. We end the war and chase away the lingering regrets of the dead. Nothing could be more to the point."
12181,"Annette: Uh, that may be true, but don't forget that your people need our help right now..."
12182,Ingrid: Your Highness... I hate them too. But the citizens of Fhirdiad have long awaited your return.
12183,Sylvain: Just give it up already. Wasting time thinking about stuff like that will only dull your blade.
12184,Ashe: Defeating Edelgard would put an end to the war. That would benefit the Kingdom as well...
12185,"Mercedes: We still need to look for Lady Rhea, so I agree that we should get to Enbarr as fast as possible."
12186,"Seteth: Professor... Whatever you decide, we shall follow."
12187,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's take back Fhirdiad, the Kingdom Capital.
Dimitri: You were entrusted with leading the church. One would think the logical step is to march to Enbarr. If Lady Rhea is being held prisoner in the Empire, we don't have time to waste taking back Fhirdiad. Can you deny it?
Byleth: ...
Choice 2: Let's take down Enbarr, the Imperial Capital.
Dimitri: Yes... It is the only way."

12241,Dimitri: You made it.
12242,Felix: We received a reply from my father. You should read it too.
12243,"Rodrigue's voice: Gilbert has filled me in on the details. He tells me you are in immediate need to additional troops. I would like to say that I will gather reinforcements and send them to the monastery at once... However, I cannot afford to leave the front lines for that long. Would you be willing to meet us south of Fraldarius territory in Ailell, the Valley of Torment? Ailell is halfway between the monastery and our territory. There, I will deliver the soldiers you require."
12244,Byleth: The Valley of Torment...
12245,Gilbert: Ailell lies on the border between Kingdom territory and Alliance territory. Humans dare not approach that place.
12246,"Dimitri: He's right. In Ailell, we can meet up with them without our enemy ever finding out."
12247,"Felix: Once my old man delivers his soldiers to us, then our war against the Empire can finally begin."
12248,"Gilbert: The path ahead will be a difficult one, Your Highness. Deadly, in all likelihood..."
12249,"Dimitri: True. But what's the point in wavering now? Father, Stepmother, Glenn, and even Dedue... I am certain this will bring them great joy. I know if I can just offer them Edelgard's head... I just know it..."

12253,"Byleth:

Felix: That's just biological circumstance. We may have the same blood, but we've nothing else in common.

12258,"Ashe: The Kingdom capital or the Imperial capital? I don't know which is the right way. If we tried to take on the Empire like this, would we really stand a chance? With House Fraldarius under attack, they probably can't spare many soldiers. On the other hand, if we did manage to take the Imperial capital, the war would be over. Hmm... I'm no good at thinking through this kind of complicated stuff."
12259,"Sylvain: Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Aw, man... I really do not want to go there."
12260,"Byleth:

12265,"Mercedes: I don't know about everyone else, but heading to the Empire seems like a good idea to me. The search for Lady Rhea will be so much easier if we can just get the Empire out of the way. I suppose Dimitri might still pose a problem though. He seems so fixated on the Imperial capital, but... I get the feeling he's not even sure what he wants anymore."
12266,"Annette: If we can take back the Kingdom, we'll recover our soldiers. And some food and supplies too, I bet. Most importantly of all, there are people in the Kingdom waiting for our help. Even His Highness understands that. I'm sure of it. Yet he wants to take on the Empire despite all that... Do you think...he just doesn't care about anything other than fighting Edelgard anymore?"
12267,"Byleth:

12271,Annette: He wasn't always like this. What happened...
12272,"Ingrid: It is imperative that we regroup with those who continue to resist. Most importantly, we must join up with the Fraldarius family. If we do, our ability to reclaim the Kingdom capital is ensured. We should aim for this outcome rather than focusing our efforts on the Imperial capital. This seems to me the best strategy at present. But I feel what His Highness feels--his hatred, his anger--so keenly, as if it were my own. So I find it difficult to oppose his wishes."
12273,"Ferdinand: Some day we will take the Imperial capital. It is odd to think that I will be invading the very city that I once called home. Ah, that is still a ways off. I will prepare for our journey to Ailell."
12274,"Linhardt: I never do get used to the sight of blood. It always makes me feel as if I might faint. I suppose I've told you that though, yes? I've no idea how you cope with it. I hope this war ends soon. I dislike being lightheaded because other people are bleeding everywhere. Though the thought of working hard for it does sound like quite a pain..."

12348,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is everyone setting out on a big campaign? Not exactly? Ah, so you're meeting up with the reinforcements. Well, you can leave guarding this place to me! I'll keep an eye out for anything suspicious!"
12349,"Kingdom Knight: It seems Arianrhod, one of the Kingdom's sturdiest fortress cities, has fallen to the Empire. It looks like Count Rowe didn't resist, and switched sides to the Empire straight away. Repaying all that the royal family has done for him with betrayal... How shameful."
12350,"Soldier: It seems some of our friends believe that if we get those reinforcements, we'll be set for provisions too... But I think it's best not to hold our breath on the food front. With the added headcount from the reinforcements, there will be even more mouths to feed."
12351,"Soldier: To the north of Garreg Mach lie the territories of the Charon and Galatea houses, former lords of the Kingdom. Even though their territory is being nibbled at by the Empire, they are still clinging to their neutrality. Since they only display enough force to defend their borders, I suppose the Empire has no incentive to attack them with any real strength."
12352,"Monk: I have lived inconspicuously these past five years, so as to not be discovered by the Empire. To be able to finally return to the monastery again is overwhelming... I hope that our brothers and sisters who ran far away will also return one day."
12353,"Yuri: The Valley of Torment, huh? I see your angle, but don't let your guard down. Any movement about their borders, and the lords of the Kingdom will react swiftly. Don't underestimate them. Keep your focus on a positive outcome. There's a lot to gain and a lot to lose."
12354,Balthus: I wonder how many soldiers that Rodrigue guy will lend us... Not that it matters much. Taking on the whole damn Empire... Not even I would bet on those odds.
12355,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even a small chance is worth fighting for.
Balthus: Now you're talkin', pal. I love a nice, reckless gamble. Oof, now I'm excited!
Choice 2: We'll give it our all. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Well, yeah. If we don't, we'll die a terrible death. I've survived this long. I refuse to give up now."
12356,"Choice 1: Even a small chance is worth fighting for.
Balthus: Now you're talkin', pal. I love a nice, reckless gamble. Oof, now I'm excited!"
12357,"Balthus: Now you're talkin', pal. I love a nice, reckless gamble. Oof, now I'm excited!"
12358,"Choice 2: We'll give it our all. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Well, yeah. If we don't, we'll die a terrible death. I've survived this long. I refuse to give up now."
12359,"Balthus: Well, yeah. If we don't, we'll die a terrible death. I've survived this long. I refuse to give up now."
12360,"Balthus: You know... Win or lose, I guess it's not worth betting on. Who would I collect from after the war's over?"
12361,"Constance: So you intend to march into Ailell. Frankly, I want no part of it. Surely, such an uneventful journey won't require my presence."
12362,"Byleth:
Choice 1: So you're staying here?
Constance: And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable.
Choice 2: I'll need you with us. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots."
12363,"Choice 1: So you're staying here?
Constance: And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable."
12364,Constance: And miss my share of the glory? Unacceptable.
12365,"Choice 2: I'll need you with us. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots."
12366,Constance: You will? Then...I shall don my marching boots.
12367,Constance: Though I would ask that we at least consider marching only under cover of night.
12368,"Hapi: The Valley of Torment... Isn't that the place where it's scorching hot year-round? You know, I've always wanted to see the world. That's why I left my village. And here I am, traveling to all these interesting new places...to kill people. Not what I had in mind. Maybe I'll find some time to admire the scenery. Though people might get mad I'm not taking this silly war seriously... Oops, that was close. Almost sighed."
12369,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports need to be reported. And for all reportable things, I'm your guy."
12370,Resident: Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to Abyss pretty frequently. We never dealt with them though. We refused their offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force. It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good. Only then there were beasts all over the place...
12371,"Resident: When the monastery fell to ruin, we lost all hope for support from the church. Most able-bodied folks abandoned Abyss for the surface around that time. Since then, we've been barely scraping by..."
12372,"Merchant: Don't tell anyone, but...I'm actually an Almyran merchant. I'm looking to export some goods from Fódlan and sell them back in my homeland. If you help me out, I'll reward you handsomely."
12373,"Merchant: Thanks for helping me out. Here's your reward. It's a stuffed Nader bear! Cute, right?! This toy is incredibly popular with Almyran children these days. Feel free to show it off, but don't tell anyone where you got it from."
12374,"Anna: It's gone! Gone, I say! I can't do business without it... Hey, you! Get it back for me, and I'll cut you the deal of your life!"
12375,"Anna: Thanks, friend! That's a huge relief. Now I can finally open up shop! I'll be sure to swing by the monastery again, so keep an eye on the schedule and bring lots of gold."
12376,Gilbert: This valley isn't a place I'd care to return to . . .
12377,"Ingrid: After the chilliness of Faerghus, I can't seem to adjust to this extreme heat."
12378,"Sylvain: Historically, there have been battles whose outcomes were determined in part by the climate. You can't argue that this heat isn't a factor."
12379,"Ingrid: In conditions like these, who knows what will become of our morale . . ."
12380,"Gilbert: Professor, be honest. How are you holding up?"
12381,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm at my limit.
Gilbert: Don't overexert yourself. Perhaps it would be best to take breaks as we proceed.
Choice 2: I never imagined it would be like this...
Gilbert: Monks once used this area as an ascetic training ground because of the intense environment."
12382,"Choice 1: I'm at my limit.
Gilbert: Don't overexert yourself. Perhaps it would be best to take breaks as we proceed."
12383,Gilbert: Don't overexert yourself. Perhaps it would be best to take breaks as we proceed.
12384,"Choice 2: I never imagined it would be like this...
Gilbert: Monks once used this area as an ascetic training ground because of the intense environment."
12385,Gilbert: Monks once used this area as an ascetic training ground because of the intense environment.
12386,Gilbert: They say Ailell was born of the goddess's rage...
12387,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Her rage?
Choice 2: I hadn't heard that before."
12388,Choice 1: Her rage?
12389,Choice 2: I hadn't heard that before.
12390,"Gilbert: If you believe the legends, this valley is evidence of the goddess's judgement...passed on humanity for its corruption. The forest that once covered the surrounding area was burnt to ash by a pillar of light that descended from the heavens. That legend fueled belief in a place of torment between our world and the next...where one's sins are purified in the cleansing flames."
12391,Dimitri: Nonsense. Sins are not so easily washed away.
12392,Gilbert: Indeed ... And there are no accounts of such a place in scripture. Yet those who cannot face their own sins have no choice but to cling to the idea.
12393,Dimitri: ...
12394,"Mercedes: Ugh, I just don't think I can take this heat anymore. I think I'm starting to see things... Near those mountains over there.... Is it just me, or is there a group of people gathered there?"
12395,Gilbert: No... It would seem you are not hallucinating after all.
12396,"Are those Rodrigue's soldiers? No, but their banner is that of... No! It can't be..."
12397,Dimitri: That is House Rowe's banner. They curried favor with that witch and sold out Faerghus.
12398,Gilbert: We messed up. There must have been a spy among us... Will you have us meet them in battle or wait for Rodrigue to arrive?
12399,Dimitri: There is only one option. How kind of them to save us the trouble of killing them later.
12400,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Aren't they your former allies?
Dimitri: Never call those traitors our allies again.
Choice 2: They sold out the Kingdom, right?
Dimitri: I will not repeat myself."
12401,"Choice 1: Aren't they your former allies?
Dimitri: Never call those traitors our allies again."
12402,Dimitri: Never call those traitors our allies again.
12403,"Choice 2: They sold out the Kingdom, right?
Dimitri: I will not repeat myself."
12404,Dimitri: I will not repeat myself.
12405,Dimitri: That banner belongs to the Gray Lion. It's a waste of breath to exchange words with one such as him.
12406,Gilbert: His Highness is correct. He is not an opponent whom we can expect to negotiate with. Everyone! Prepare for the attack!
12407,Suggested Level: 29
12408,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
12409,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
12410,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
12411,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle.
12412,"Gwendal: The Valley of Torment . . . Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course . . ."
12413,"Gilbert: That man, who raises the Lion's flag? Lord Gwendal. He is an elder knight who serves House Rowe. Gwendal would, without thought, fight any battle if ordered. There is no chance of negotiating with him."
12414,Gilbert: Ailell is a deadly place. Flames burst from the ground with no warning. Sane people usually avoid it.
12415,"Dimitri: So, the flames of torment burn your sins, your life, your everything. If you wish to spare yourself the goddess's wrath, tread lightly."
12416,Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!
12417,Rodrigue: So Cornelia has planted spies even inside Garreg Mach.
12418,Gwendal: The Shield of Faerghus has appeared! We can expect more out of him than the young ones.
12419,"Rodrigue: To meet you in a place like this... No, that won't do. I'll leave the talking until after the battle. Here's a small souvenir for you. Put it to good use. (Receive Sword of Moralta)"
12420,"Gwendel: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendel, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!"
12421,Dimitri: The man praised as a lion is degraded to a mere traitor's underling.
12422,"Gwendel: A traitor's underling? That's upsetting, Your Highness. I am and always have been a knight of House Rowe."
12423,Dimitri: How dare you? You are nothing but a lowly beast scavenging for scraps. You have forgotten the dignity of knighthood.
12424,"Gwendel: I may be lowly, but this beast is loyal to his master."
12425,Dimitri: Ha! Then I had better kill a pet and deliver its head to that master . . .
12426,"Gwendal: So. You've chosen to turn your blade against the count. Heh. Never thought I'd see the day, mongrel."
12427,"Yuri: And yet you are seeing it, aren't you? Say what you will. I know your true feelings for me. Sure, you watched my back by order of the count. But you cared too. You were the only one who treated me as an equal."
12428,Gwendal: That is all in the past. This is no time for misplaced sentimentality. I must do what I came here to do.
12429,"Gwendel: Ah, so I have found a place to die . . . Young ones . . . I thank you . . ."
12430,Gilbert: It is the way of knights to follow their master's orders without argument. Lord Gwendel was a good man.
12431,Dimitri: Now he's just a corpse. Let's go. Rodrigue is waiting for us.
12432,"Rodrigue: It's been too long, Your Highness. But try to temper your joy, will you? This is a war, after all."
12433,Dimitri: To say such a thing at a time like this. You have not changed one bit.
12434,"Rodrigue: Don't let looks deceive you. I've had a rough go of it ever since I crossed blades with those traitors in Fhirdiad. When I heard you'd been executed, I rushed there as fast as I could, blind with fury. When I got there, I was fed some garbage about not being able to see your body. The next thing I knew, I was gripping my blade and... Gilbert, you have done well to locate His Highness. I am truly grateful."
12435,"Rodrigue: And you... I have you to thank, as well."
12436,"Byleth:
Choice 1: As his professor, it was my duty.
Choice 2: We were all fortunate."
12437,"Choice 1: As his professor, it was my duty."
12438,Choice 2: We were all fortunate.
12439,"Rodrigue: Well, we are in your debt. I will repay you for this someday, I swear it. And you, Felix... You have also done well to bring His Highness here."
12440,Felix: Hmph.
12441,"Dimitri: Tell us all you know, Rodrigue."
12442,"Rodrigue: I'm afraid there's not much to tell. You are aware that the western region of the Kingdom was taken by the Empire, correct?"
12443,"Dimitri: Yes, so I have heard. They are now calling it the Faerghus Dukedom or some nonsense."
12444,"Rodrigue: If you know that much, then the rest won't take long. Enemy or not, it's undeniable that Cornelia's plan was nothing short of genius. After seizing power, she invited the Imperial army to Fhirdiad. There, she reorganized her troops and then sent soldiers to hunt me down. Because of that, we were forced to act defensively. And now we're being forced into a difficult battle. She's been controlling the situation all along."
12445,Dimitri: So that's been the witch's plan from the start. I should have killed her ages ago.
12446,"Rodrigue: Your Highness... Fhirdiad is in a terrible state right now. The tyranny is unbearable, and so the rebellions are endless. Refugees starve to death in the streets. If I may speak freely, Your Highness... We should change course for Fhirdiad and take down those traitors before we embark to Enbarr."
12447,Dimitri: There's no time for that. We must annihilate Enbarr before all else.
12448,"Rodrigue: Think this through. I understand wanting to destroy the Empire and the emperor. I want that so much it hurts. But which is more important, the dead or the living?"
12449,Dimitri: (angrily) SILENCE.
12450,"Rodrigue: No, Dimitri, you will hear me out."
12451,Dimitri: Are you asking me...asking the dead...to forgive that woman?
12452,"Rodrigue: No, I would not ask that of you. What I am asking is that you allow us to prioritize the Kingdom capital over the Imperial capital for now. As Lambert's close and trusted friend, I am confident that he would have advised the same."
12453,"Dimitri: Do not dare to put words in the mouth of the dead. They are your words alone, even if you borrowed their lips. Until I offer up that woman's head, Father will remain a slave to his lingering regret and hatred... Even now, he suffers. It is ceaseless. As we waste time with idle chatter, his suffering continues!"
12454,"Rodrigue: (sighs) You are my king. Our king. Wherever you lead, we will follow. But Your Highness... There are those who take up their sword in the name of revenge, and yet along the way, lose the strength and composure to follow through... You would do well to bear that in mind."
12455,Dimitri: ...
12456,"Rodrigue: Ah, I nearly forgot. Take this, Your Highness. The time has come for it to be wielded by its true master."
12457,Dimitri: Areadbhar... The Hero's Relic once wielded by my father.
12458,Rodrigue: The very same. I managed to steal it back from one of Cornelia's underlings in Fhirdiad.
12459,"Felix: Understated as ever, Father. It must have been a true struggle to get it back."
12460,"Dimitri: I... I am grateful, my friend."
12461,"Rodrigue: Gilbert, Professor. May I request something of you? I wish to fight at your side."
12462,"Felix: Senile already, old man? Who will protect our territory?"
12463,"Rodrigue: I expected it would come to this, so I left those matters to my younger brother. He has my complete faith. I must keep my promise to our fallen king...to my dear friend."
12464,Byleth: What promise?
12465,"Rodrigue: A very old one. I swore it nearly 10 years ago. Now then, Your Highness. Let's destroy the Empire together. My men and I will spare no effort. I pray that you are right...and that this will save the Kingdom."
12466,Rodrigue: Our orders are to capture Enbarr by striking the enemy stronghold directly... How familiar are you with the geography of Fódlan?
12467,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Very familiar.
Rodrigue: Then you must be aware that the Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains, right?
(Byleth nods)
Choice 2: Not very familiar.
Rodrigue: The Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains."
12468,"Choice 1: Very familiar.
Rodrigue: Then you must be aware that the Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains, right?
(Byleth nods)"
12469,"Rodrigue: Then you must be aware that the Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains, right?"
12470,(Byleth nods)
12471,"Choice 2: Not very familiar.
Rodrigue: The Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains."
12472,Rodrigue: The Kingdom and the Empire are separated by the impassable Oghma Mountains.
12473,Rodrigue: Legend has it that Saint Seiros once crossed over those mountains to fight against the Fell King Nemesis... But don't fool yourself. Leading an army over such steep mountains would be near impossible.
12474,"Gilbert: In order to infiltrate the Empire, we have no choice but to go around the mountains, either to the east or to the west."
12475,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's go east.
Rodrigue: Yes, I agree.
Choice 2: Let's go west.
Gilbert: Hmm. I believe that may be difficult. After all, the western region of the Kingdom is already loyal to the Empire. Perhaps we should consider going east...using the route that passes through Alliance territory."
12476,"Choice 1: Let's go east.
Rodrigue: Yes, I agree."
12477,"Rodrigue: Yes, I agree."
12478,"Choice 2: Let's go west.
Gilbert: Hmm. I believe that may be difficult. After all, the western region of the Kingdom is already loyal to the Empire. Perhaps we should consider going east...using the route that passes through Alliance territory."
12479,"Gilbert: Hmm. I believe that may be difficult. After all, the western region of the Kingdom is already loyal to the Empire. Perhaps we should consider going east...using the route that passes through Alliance territory."
12480,"Rodrigue: The Alliance is currently split in two. Those who stand with the Empire and those who are against it. Leading the Imperial faction is House Gloucester, while House Riegan leads those who oppose. We should take advantage of their internal conflict and proceed east along the mountains until we reach the Great Bridge of Myrddin in Alliance territory."
12481,Byleth: Why there?
12482,"Gilbert: The Airmid River divides Alliance and Empire territory. There are many large bridges that cross it. However, the Great Bridge of Myrddin is by far the largest, and it is also the closest to the monastery. I believe you crossed that bridge five years ago on your journey to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion."
12483,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's risky...
Rodrigue: I'm afraid we have no other option. This is our only hope.
Choice 2: What if the Empire and the Alliance both attack?
Gilbert: I'm afraid it's a possibility. But it's still more practical than passing through the west."
12484,"Choice 1: It's risky...
Rodrigue: I'm afraid we have no other option. This is our only hope."
12485,Rodrigue: I'm afraid we have no other option. This is our only hope.
12486,"Choice 2: What if the Empire and the Alliance both attack?
Gilbert: I'm afraid it's a possibility. But it's still more practical than passing through the west."
12487,Gilbert: I'm afraid it's a possibility. But it's still more practical than passing through the west.
12488,Rodrigue: Perhaps our next move should be to contact House Riegan and request their cooperation...
12489,Byleth: Do you think they'll help us?
12490,"Rodrigue: Claude of House Riegan is the leader of the Alliance and is firmly against the Empire. They are the enemy of our enemy... In other words, hopefully a friend."
12491,Dimitri: Are you suggesting that we ask House Riegan to engage the Gloucester soldiers?
12492,"Gilbert: I am. If we take the bridge, then House Gloucester will no longer be able to receive help from the Empire. There's no way a man as wise as Claude would refuse our request."
12493,Rodrigue: And once we manage to capture the Great Bridge and gain a foothold into the Empire...
12494,Dimitri: Then we cross Gronder Field and head south toward Enbarr.
12495,"Ashe: But if we get attacked from both sides, we'll have to fight people from the Alliance, won't we?"
12496,"Mercedes: Speaking of House Gloucester, I wonder how Lorenz is holding up..."
12497,"Annette: If we meet him again, it will probably be as enemies. To be honest, I'd rather avoid seeing him altogether."
12498,"Dimitri: If you do not wish to kill familiar faces, do not tarry over the corpses of the dead."
12499,Felix: Hmph. Good advice.
12500,Dimitri: Prepare yourselves. It is time to steel your souls for the task at hand.

"
12546,"I'm glad for it.
"
12547,"Do you know what's going on?
"
12548,"Intent on the Imperial Capital, the Kingdom army goes around the Oghma Mountains and marches through Alliance territory as they continue south. But this route takes them through the territory of House Gloucester--Imperial supporters--so they request help from Claude, the leader of House Riegan. Claude agrees to to distract House Gloucester's soldiers, and the Kingdom army marches onward toward the Great Bridge of Myrddin to cross the Airmid River, which separates the Alliance and the Empire.
"
12549,"Rodrigue: Even though it's in ruins, in some strange way, this monastery never truly changes, does it? I studied at the Officers Academy when I was young. Those memories come rushing back whenever I return. What are you doing at this hour, anyway?"
12550,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I couldn't sleep.

12555,Rodrigue: Perhaps you'll allow me to join you...
12556,Byleth: (nods)
12557,Rodrigue: Much appreciated.
12558,"Rodrigue: (sighs). I keep recalling my eldest son... He was quite gifted. In fact, he was appointed a knight at the age of 15. I still vividly remember the day he was granted a sword from His Majesty..."
12559,Byleth: Your son... Isn't he...
12560,"Rodrigue: Dead. He was killed nine years ago in Duscur. All that returned of him that day were his sword and his armor... After it happened, I said something horrible to Felix. He's hated me ever since...and I don't blame him. No matter how much you grieve, the dead will never return. No magic in the world can bring them back. That's why their memory clings to the living like a curse. The more they were loved, the tighter their hold, and the more suffering they cause... I fear I am not a strong enough man to scold His Highness for his foolishness."
12561,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Someone must.
Rodrigue: Right you are... As adults, it is our responsibility to scold him and help him find his way again, but really... I'm just a failure of a man. (sighs)

Rodrigue: Right you are... As adults, it is our responsibility to scold him and help him find his way again, but really... I'm just a failure of a man. (sighs)"
12563,"Rodrigue: Right you are... As adults, it is our responsibility to scold him and help him find his way again, but really... I'm just a failure of a man. (sighs)"
12564,"Choice 2: I know how you feel...
Rodrigue: Since this war began, we've seen countless generals, soldiers, and citizens die. It never gets easier. (sighs)"
12565,"Rodrigue: Since this war began, we've seen countless generals, soldiers, and citizens die. It never gets easier. (sighs)"
12566,"Rodrigue: Professor... I entrust the young prince, and the future of Faerghus, to you."
12567,"Byleth:
Choice 1: This is unexpected...
Rodrigue: I suppose that was a dramatic way of putting it. My apologies.
Choice 2: I won't let you down.
Rodrigue: You're a brave one, aren't you? One worthy of leading the Church of Seiros, I daresay."
12568,"Choice 1: This is unexpected...
Rodrigue: I suppose that was a dramatic way of putting it. My apologies."
12569,Rodrigue: I suppose that was a dramatic way of putting it. My apologies.
12570,"Choice 2: I won't let you down.
Rodrigue: You're a brave one, aren't you? One worthy of leading the Church of Seiros, I daresay."
12571,"Rodrigue: You're a brave one, aren't you? One worthy of leading the Church of Seiros, I daresay."
12572,"Rodrigue: You should know that I have no intention of insisting that you take back Fhirdiad. All I ask is that you continue to rein in Dimitri's manic desire for revenge. Now then... we have received House Riegan's consent. All that's left is for us to depart. If we make it through Gloucester Territory and across the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in Empire territory. You are not afraid, are you?"
12573,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A little.
Rodrigue: Ha! No need to worry. Don't you underestimate the power of my soldiers.
Choice 2: I don't feel anything.
Rodrigue: Yes.Such is war..."
12574,"Choice 1: A little.
Rodrigue: Ha! No need to worry. Don't you underestimate the power of my soldiers."
12575,Rodrigue: Ha! No need to worry. Don't you underestimate the power of my soldiers.
12576,"Choice 2: I don't feel anything.
Rodrigue: Yes.Such is war..."
12577,Rodrigue: Yes.Such is war...
12578,"Rodrigue: I'm glad you were the one to lead the Blue Lion House, Professor. I mean that..."
12579,"Dimitri: If you stand in my way, I will strike you down."
12580,"Felix: Leaving the house in my uncle's hands? What is the old man thinking? I always knew my father was mad, but this time he's gone too far."
12581,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: My uncle is a reliable man. But still.
Choice 2: I'm actually grateful to him.
Felix: Easy for you to say. You hardly know the man."
12582,"Choice 1: I agree. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: My uncle is a reliable man. But still."
12583,Felix: My uncle is a reliable man. But still.
12584,"Choice 2: I'm actually grateful to him.
Felix: Easy for you to say. You hardly know the man."
12585,Felix: Easy for you to say. You hardly know the man.
12586,Felix: Only a fool would abandon his own territory.
12587,"Ashe: The area around Castle Gaspard, where I was living, is under the control of House Rowe, who have submitted to the Empire. If I hadn't come to Garreg Mach, I might have ended up as your enemy at Ailell. That thought makes me really happy to be here now. I don't think I would have been able to handle facing all of you in battle."
12588,"Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was gonna die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it."
12589,"Mercedes: It looks like we're all set with food supplies, thanks to Lord Rodrigue! We have more soldiers to feed now, so we'll still need to ration... But I think we have enough extra to make some tasty treats! I'll go scout the pantry."
12590,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That would be wonderful. (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: We can enjoy it together over some tea!
Choice 2: We shouldn't be wasteful...
Mercedes: That's true, but it's important to indulge every now and again. It's been so difficult lately and everyone is worn out. We won't be able to go on if we don't treat ourselves!"
12591,"Choice 1: That would be wonderful. (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: We can enjoy it together over some tea!"
12592,Mercedes: We can enjoy it together over some tea!
12593,"Choice 2: We shouldn't be wasteful...

12594,"Mercedes: That's true, but it's important to indulge every now and again. It's been so difficult lately and everyone is worn out. We won't be able to go on if we don't treat ourselves!"
12595,Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
12596,"Byleth:
Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Choice 2: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
12597,"Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies..."
12598,"Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies..."
12599,"Choice 2: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
12600,"Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
12601,"Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days..."
12602,"Ingrid: Just like House Fraldarius, House Galatea is currently being invaded by the Dukedom. My family is not as wealthy as most others, so we are incapable of sparing resources or reinforcements. I'm sorry. It's just so frustrating, not being able to do anything to help."
12603,"Ferdinand: What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River. For the sake of my family, I wish we could invade the Empire from there. But I do not have the power to advocate for that. Strategically, Myrddin is more important."
12604,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Someday, we'll take it back. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!
Choice 2: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!"
12605,"Choice 1: Someday, we'll take it back. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!"
12606,"Ferdinand: Thank you, Professor. I will not give in. Not until I have restored my noble pride!"
12607,"Choice 2: Taking it back would be difficult.
Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!"
12608,"Ferdinand: Yes, I know it would be difficult, but I will not give in!"
12609,"Linhardt: Since I'm originally from the Empire, it seems no one trusts me with any important tasks. Fine by me. Honestly, I'd bet they're watching my every move to make sure I can be trusted."
12610,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do.
Choice 2: Probably. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?"
12611,"Choice 1: I'm sure they're not...
Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do."
12612,"Linhardt: If I were in charge, it's what I would do."
12613,"Choice 2: Probably. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?"
12614,"Linhardt: I knew it. War makes people crazy, huh?"
12615,"Caspar: The Airmid River separates the Empire and Alliance. It's the largest river in Fódlan. Sometimes it'll flood when there's lots of rain, but... At least the land gets some extra water!"
12616,"Bernadetta: War isn't kind to you if you're a recluse. By the time you realize what's going on, you're already under attack. And if you're off by yourself, you can get killed with no one ever finding out."
12617,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sounds like you're learning.
Choice 2: I highly doubt that would happen. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)"
12618,Choice 1: Sounds like you're learning.
12619,Choice 2: I highly doubt that would happen. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
12620,"Bernadetta: Oh, that'd be awful--just terrible! OK, Professor, I get it. I know I'll have to come out."
12621,"Dorothea: We're going to invade the Empire...which means we'll be fighting people we know, won't we? If we're attacked by someone we know, or used to think of as a friend, is it permitted to run away?"
12622,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Choice 2: I wouldn't blame you. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
12623,"Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale."
12624,Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
12625,"Choice 2: I wouldn't blame you. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
12626,"Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
12627,"Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire. Right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy."
12628,"Raphael: I finally got to eat a full meal for the first time in forever, and it's all thanks to Lord Rodrigue! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?"
12629,"Ignatz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin isn't just a bridge. It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom."
12630,"Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across a river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire."
12631,Marianne: My adoptive father is planning on supporting the Riegan family in the upcoming operation. He says it's the perfect opportunity to get both the Alliance and the Kingdom on his side. He even insisted that I promote the good name of House Edmund to the people of the Kingdom.
12632,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Have you managed to do that?
Marianne: No... I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
Choice 2: Do you really need to promote them? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: He'll see right through me if I lie, so I can't ignore the request..."
12633,"Choice 1: Have you managed to do that?
Marianne: No... I'm not very good at this sort of thing."
12634,Marianne: No... I'm not very good at this sort of thing.
12635,"Choice 2: Do you really need to promote them? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: He'll see right through me if I lie, so I can't ignore the request..."
12636,"Marianne: He'll see right through me if I lie, so I can't ignore the request..."
12637,"Marianne: But I suppose I did just tell you, so that must count for something."
12638,"Hilda: Claude says he's on our side. I know everything will be fine if we leave it to him! He may act like a layabout, but he's actually smart. And although Claude isn't honest about some things, you can trust him when it counts."
12639,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're not calming my nerves.
Hilda: No, I'm sure it'll be fine! That's just my gut feeling, but still.
Choice 2: Yeah, I'm not worried. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Yeah, he'll do us proud! That's just my gut feeling, but still."
12640,"Choice 1: You're not calming my nerves.
Hilda: No, I'm sure it'll be fine! That's just my gut feeling, but still."
12641,"Hilda: No, I'm sure it'll be fine! That's just my gut feeling, but still."
12642,"Choice 2: Yeah, I'm not worried. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Yeah, he'll do us proud! That's just my gut feeling, but still."
12643,"Hilda: Yeah, he'll do us proud! That's just my gut feeling, but still."
12644,"Leonie: Lord Rodrigue seems reliable. But even with his help, aren't we still a little shorthanded? We can probably make it to the Great Bridge of Myrddin. But beyond that, I don't know. Don't let Dimitri push you too much, Professor. It'll shorten your life for sure."
12645,"Seteth: So, the renowed Shield of Faerghus is now on our side. That is quite reassuring. Not only will he provide valuable support in battle, but he has also brought us much-needed supplies. We cannot grow complacent, however. We must take the Imperial capital as soon as possible."
12646,"Flayn: Being here brings back all manner of memories. The days I spent studying here with you and everyone else--those days were so special to me. They truly were some of the warmest days of my life. I hold them dear in my heart. And now, to be forced to fight with those I was once so close to, my friends... It is most saddening."
12647,"Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does your talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating."
12648,"Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for...someone to talk to?"
12649,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Choice 2: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
12650,"Choice 1: Yes. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."
12651,"Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."
12652,"Choice 2: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
12653,"Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
12654,"Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor."
12655,"Gilbert: House Fraldarius is a military house. They swore fealty to the royal family at the Kingdom's founding. The current family head, Lord Rodrigue, was raised like a brother to the former king. He harbors a loyalty that goes beyond mere duty. Perhaps that is why he was willing to lend us his aid."
12656,"Alois: I thought House Fraldarius had an invasion of their own to worry about. I'm impressed Lord Rodrigue was willing to provide us all these reinforcements and supplies. The knights' morale is really boosted, seeing as they have had their first good meal in a while. Let's hope we can keep this up, and take down the Great Bridge of Myrddin!"
12657,Catherine: Gwendal made the ultimate sacrifice in service of House Rowe. I understand that feeling. I'd do anything for Lady Rhea.
12658,"Byleth:
Choice 1: But--
Catherine: You think we should have stopped him. You might be right about that.
Choice 2: I understand it too. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: I'm surprised. I didn't peg you as the kind of person to say that sort of thing."
12659,"Choice 1: But--
Catherine: You think we should have stopped him. You might be right about that."
12660,Catherine: You think we should have stopped him. You might be right about that.
12661,"Choice 2: I understand it too. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: I'm surprised. I didn't peg you as the kind of person to say that sort of thing."
12662,Catherine: I'm surprised. I didn't peg you as the kind of person to say that sort of thing.
12663,"Catherine: At any rate, it's up to the individual how to demonstrate loyalty."
12664,"Shamir: So, House Riegan accepted. I knew the leader of the Alliance wouldn't refuse. Still, we can't let our guard down. There's no telling when he'll turn on us. If we advance through the Alliance into the Empire, our chances for reconnaissance will be limited. I just hope it goes according to plan."
12665,"Cyril: Lady Rhea must be so scared. We gotta find her quick as we can. We got reinforcements from the Kingdom people now, right? Then we oughta be able to go save her!"
12666,"Rodrigue: Even after all these decades, the academy hasn't changed a bit. I remember it well, even now. I used to sneak out of lectures with Lambert almost every day... I suppose this is not the time for an old man's nostalgia. We have received approval from House Riegan. We should set out as soon as you're ready."
12667,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Lord Rodrigue is revered by all as the Shield of Faerghus. I was imagining a more stern-faced fellow, but he's actually quite friendly. Shocking! I heard that he recently spent the night drinking in the dining hall with soldiers from the church..."
12668,"Kingdom Knight: Lord Gwendal was pretty tough. If only he'd been on our side, he would have been a great ally. But it was Lord Gwendal himself who made the decision to throw his lot in with the Empire alongside his liege. I will neither pity him nor mourn for him. It would be an insult to his honor. To follow the path of justice, as long as life endures. That is the duty of a knight of Faerghus."
12669,"Knight of Seiros: Do you really think it's a good idea to trust Claude? If you let yourself get taken in by his silver tongue, you might wind up regretting it... The thing is, ah... Five years ago, I was taken in by his tricks myself... I was given a long and grueling lecture by my unit leader that day... Urge. The memory of it is still too painful..."
12670,"Merchant: I've been away from Garreg Mach for a while, but I came back when I heard the rumors of what you were doing. The scars of five years ago may still be raw, but it's nice to be back. Anyway, I'm going to start up business here again, so I look forward to your patronage!"
12671,"Kingdom Knight: From the outset, House Riegan and House Gloucester have been fighting over leadership of the Alliance. Then this war comes along...and their opinions are split about whether to ally with the Empire or not. Their existing enmity only worsened, leading them to full-on conflict with one another. However, the leader of the Alliance is a very shrewd man... It's difficult to predict what he'll do at this point."
12672,"Soldier: On the north side of the Great Bridge of Myrddin lies the territory of Acheron of the Alliance, and to the south, the Empire's Bergliez territory. Count Bergliez has held the position of Minister of Military Affairs for the Empire ever since the days of Emperor Ionius. The current emperor seems to have brought the corrupt nobility to heel, but Count Bergliez looks to be an exception."
12673,"Soldier: We were raised by Lord Rodrigue himself to be the elite of the elite. Even if our enemy is the Empire's vast army, we can overcome the difference in numbers. The one thing that could prove to be a problem is if our food and supplies don't hold up. If we attack the Imperial capital before the Kingdom capital, we'll have to be swift if we want to prevail."
12674,"Yuri: Damn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would show up. They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell from way out there. Guess it's been awhile since I've left House Rowe, so it doesn't bother me much to have to fight them. Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this."
12675,"Balthus: I hear Claude's gonna fight the good fight with us. Heh, not a bad ally to have, that one. Something about him is untrustworthy, but from what I hear, he's a man who keeps his promises."
12676,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you two on friendly terms? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Eh, sort of? We're both Alliance nobility, and we've crossed paths a handful of times these past five years.
Choice 2: Are you sure you don't mind?
Balthus: It's fine by me. At least until we pass the Great Bridge, he'll be valuable from a tactical standpoint."
12677,"Choice 1: Are you two on friendly terms? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Eh, sort of? We're both Alliance nobility, and we've crossed paths a handful of times these past five years."
12678,"Balthus: Eh, sort of? We're both Alliance nobility, and we've crossed paths a handful of times these past five years."
12679,"Choice 2: Are you sure you don't mind?
Balthus: It's fine by me. At least until we pass the Great Bridge, he'll be valuable from a tactical standpoint."
12680,"Balthus: It's fine by me. At least until we pass the Great Bridge, he'll be valuable from a tactical standpoint."
12681,Balthus: I honestly have no idea what will happen after we cross the bridge...
12682,"Constance: Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still the wild palpitations in my chest. I have made myself ready to the extent that I could, but now that the day draws near... I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle. However, if we succeed in defeating the Empire and rebuilding the Kingdom, I may yet achieve my dream."
12683,"Hapi: That sorcerer who runs the Kingdom capital... Cornelia's her name, yeah? The woman who kidnapped me was called that too. But it's probably just a coincidence. Super common name. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Cornelia. Right?"
12684,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Some Kingdom noble called Rodrigue has been footing the bill to feed the people of Garreg Mach. Feeding the hungry with his own gold... Just, wow! Even the folks down here have been getting a share of the provisions. Needless to say, this Rodrigue guy is popular these days. We're all very grateful."
12685,Rogue: I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter down here--nowhere else to go. Be careful up there. All sides are brining their strongest people to this fight.
12686,"Rogue: Not sure what brought people back up above, but I'm glad for it. The dining hall, the greenhouse... They're all ripe for the picking again. Uh, I mean, for them! Good for them!"
12687,"Resident: I heard the Kingdom fell. If that's true, why are there Kingdom soldiers right above us? Do you know what's going on?"
12688,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Kingdom hasn't fallen yet.
Choice 2: The prince is putting it back together."
12689,Choice 1: The Kingdom hasn't fallen yet.
12690,Choice 2: The prince is putting it back together.
12691,Resident: Is that so? Sounds like a good business opportunity. Thanks for the tip. Time to rake in some gold.
12692,"Gilbert: It seems that, despite the danger, the merchant traffic continues to increase. We should take action, before there is an incident."
12693,"Gilbert: I'm happy that you moved quickly. Now the merchants will be safe. Since we will be using this area as a base, it's critical that we secure it as best we can."
12694,"Girl: When I got home after eating, I realized that the special thing Anna asked me to look after had vanished! Oh, what do I do..."
12695,"Girl: Hey, thanks a lot! From now on, I'll do my absolute best to live up to the standards Anna set for all merchants! Oh, and if I open a shop, I hope you'll pay it a visit or three, Professor!"
12696,"Gilbert: Our scout has returned. As expected, there are quite a few Imperial soldiers stationed there."
12697,"Dimitri: I see. So the enemy has prepared for our arrival... It matters not. I will kill them all, whether they are one or one hundred."
12698,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's not necessary.
Choice 2: Don't say such things..."
12699,Choice 1: That's not necessary.
12700,Choice 2: Don't say such things...
12701,"Dimitri: What would you do, if you saw the people who stole everything from you? If you saw them right before your eyes, living carefree lives and feeling no guilt. Would you feel nothing? Do nothing? Five years ago... Did you not deem the woman who killed Jeralt to be unforgivable? I am most certain that you did. You couldn't let her get away with her crime, so you took up your sword in pursuit."
12702,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're wrong.
Dimitri: I think not. We're the same, you and I.
Choice 2: You're right.
Dimitri: Precisely my point. We're the same, you and I."
12703,"Choice 1: You're wrong.
Dimitri: I think not. We're the same, you and I."
12704,"Dimitri: I think not. We're the same, you and I."

Dimitri: Precisely my point. We're the same, you and I."
12706,"Dimitri: Precisely my point. We're the same, you and I."
12707,Felix: You're wasting your time. There's nothing to be gained from exchanging words with a boar that has lost its mind.
12708,Gilbert: Felix...
12709,Felix: This is war. Every last one of us has lost someone we care for. But we choose to suppress our anger and go right on living. Do you know why?
12710,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Because we've given up.
Felix: Revenge can't bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately such a thing isn't possible. Hanging onto your anger, like the boar here, is futile.
Choice 2: Because it's pointless.
Felix: That's right. All the boar is accomplishing is stacking up more corpses."
12711,"Choice 1: Because we've given up.
Felix: Revenge can't bring the dead back to life. Unfortunately such a thing isn't possible. Hanging onto your anger, like the boar here, is futile."

12714,Felix: That's right. All the boar is accomplishing is stacking up more corpses.
12715,"Dimitri: Tell me, Felix... If the dead are beyond reach, is it not also pointless to mourn or even bury those who are lost?"
12716,"Felix: Ha. That mind of yours. I'm done here. Remember, Professor. It's not compassion for this fool that has brought our army so far. There are those of us who despise the Empire, and those who side with the church. If we keep running down this path, it's only a matter of time before the ground beneath us collapses."
12717,"Rodrigue: That's enough, Felix."
12718,"Felix: Hmph. You're a damned fool, old man."
12719,Rodrigue: The soldiers are ready to march on your command.
12720,Dimitri: Then let's move out at once. Every moment counts.
12721,Rodrigue: Understood. Let's show those Empire dastards the power of the Knights of Faerghus!

12727,"Ladislava: That symbol...it's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!"
12728,"Dimitri: Edelgard's dog, huh? All the more reason to kill her."
12729,Rodrigue: Attack Ladislava and take the bridge. Shall we begin?
12730,"Rodrigue: Let's deal with the enemies protecting the fortress quickly, and take control of this area."
12731,Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!
12732,Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge form us?
12733,"Rodrigue: This is no good... Reinforcements keep coming, and more will soon join them."
12734,Dedue: Your Highness! Apologies for the late arrival.
12735,Dimitri: Dedue... You're alive... How?!
12736,"Dedue: We can discuss it later. For now, allow me to join your forces."
12737,"Lorenz: I, Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, have arrived to join the battle in my father's stead! (Lorenz is either unrecruited or alive.)"
12738,Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too! (Lorenz is killed in part 1 in classic mode.)
12739,Ladislava: Thanks for making your way here. Annihilate the enemy with the rest of them!
12740,Lorenz: Is that...the professor? Why would someone like that join such a senseless fight?
12741,"Ferdinand: Lorenz! Here you are. I am heading south, so I will leave this area to you."
12742,Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
12743,Acheron: I've got to make her name known to Her Majesty through distinguished service.
12744,"Rodrigue: Acheron, a minor lord of the Alliance territory... If he's fighting for the Empire, we've no choice but to attack him."
12745,"Acheron: As they say, if you can't beat them, join them. I'm not in for a beating, am I?"
12746,Acheron: Argh... I never should have allied with... the Empire...
12747,Ladislava: To repay Her Majesty's favor...I will not let you pass!
12748,"Ladislava: I can't retreat... Even if it costs me my life, I've got to protect the Great Bridge."
12749,Ladislava: Lady Edelgard... I'm sorry...
12750,"Ferdinand: Ladislava, no! I will protect this area!"
12751,"Ferdinand: After this battle, I will be known far and wide as the legendary Ferdinand of Adrestia!"
12752,"Ferdinand: Edelgard has always been obsessed with you. I am a little envious, to be frank. I will just have to impress her with my skills on the battlefield!"
12753,"Dorothea: Oh, Ferdie. You opposed Edie for so long... I had real hopes for you, you know? Now you're following her. Is that your duty as a noble? Follow your master when they say to heel?"
12754,"Ferdinand: I will not try to explain my duty or hers. You would not understand. I wish you could. Anyway, no time for idle chitchat!"
12755,"Ferdinand: Here we are, after all these years, forced to fight one another. What a tragic conclusion to our story."
12756,"Constance: It seems inevitable, but I am sorry that this is where our chosen paths have led us. We all do what we must..."
12757,"Ferdinand: Indeed...and I must put an end to your journey. I am sorry, Constance."
12758,"Ferdinand: Retreat, Ladislava! Tell Her Majesty about this!"
12759,Ladislava: We've already sent a messenger! I can't let you die while I flee!
12760,"Ferdinand: In that case... Even if I die, you must protect this area."
12761,"Ferdinand: Even if I die, please... protect this area."
12762,Lorenz: To oppose the Empire at a time like this would be entirely too reckless.
12763,"Lorenz: It's been a while, Professor. If this were anywhere but a battlefield, I would offer you tea. I've no choice but to follow the Empire, if I wish to live. I hope you will not think ill of me."
12764,Lorenz: Lay me to rest...in a manner that is befitting...of the nobility...
12765,"Lorenz: I yield. Though I will not beg for my life. That would be unbecoming, wouldn't it?"
12766,"Lorenz: You're inviting me to join you? But...to abandon House Gloucester... No--I can convince my father. I will help you topple the Empire, I swear it!"
12767,Dimitri: It's a farce. All of it...
12768,Dimitri: Dedue! Why...How are you here? You died. Five years ago...
12769,Dedue: I was saved by my brothers. Men of Duscur.
12770,Dimitri: Those people you were with... They were of Duscur? And they saved you?
12771,(Dedue nods)
12772,"Dedue: Your Highness. I asked that you fulfill your long-held desire, did I not? Allow me to once again act as your sword and shield. Please, let me witness your triumph. I want to behold the moment your wish is finally granted."
12773,"Dimitri: Dedue... Of course. And in exchange, I ask that you swear something to me, here and now. Do not ever throw your life away again. Understood?"
12774,Dedue: Your Highness... Understood.
12775,Dimitri: Idiots. Embracing death for the sake of that woman. Truly foolish...
12776,"Byleth:

Choice 2: What troubles you?"
12777,Choice 1: Aren't you happy we won?
12778,Choice 2: What troubles you?
12779,Dimitri: I... I don't know.
12780,Byleth: Do you regret killing them?
12781,"Dimitri: They were just beasts with human faces. I had no choice but to kill them, and so I did. That...that is all there is to it."
12782,Rodrigue: It's about time you two returned. We must discuss our next course of action.
12783,"Maiden: Please! I need to join you, no matter the cost!"
12784,"Kingdom General: I'm sorry, but my hands are tied..."
12785,Rodrigue: By the goddess! What's with all the commotion?
12786,(The Maiden notices Dimitri)
12787,"Maiden: *gasps* (written as ""..."")"
12788,"Rodrigue: What is this girl doing here? This is an army, not an orphanage."
12789,Kingdom General: I believe she's from a nearby village. She keeps insisting that she needs to join our ranks.
12790,Rodrigue: And you thought we could use a child on the front lines? Hurry up and take her back to her parents.
12791,"Maiden: My family is gone. I don't have anywhere else to go. Please! I can use magic and I can fight! I can cook, do laundry, anything!"
12792,"Rodrigue: I'm sure there are plenty of more suitable places to find work. Why are you so fixated on this army, young lady?"
12793,Maiden: I need...to get revenge. I must strike down the one who murdered my big brother!
12794,Rodrigue: Your Highness... What should we do?
12795,Dimitri: Let her do as she pleases.
12796,Maiden: Thank you...very much.

12850,"- Cut to another area of the Great Bridge of Myrddin -
"
12851,"- Cut to outside. Maiden is bowing her head, as in prayer -
"
12852,"The Kingdom army departs from the Great Bridge of Myrddin and marches south toward Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Meanwhile, the Alliance army follows from behind to invade Imperial territory, and the Empire has dispatched forces from Fort Merceus to intercept them. The curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies, which will come to be known as the Battle at Gronder, held on the same plains that witnessed the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.
"
12853,Gilbert: We have received a report from our spy. It would seem the Empire is gathering troops at Fort Merceus. This is undoubtedly in response to us taking the Great Bridge of Myrddin. Their numbers are more than double ours. We believe that the emperor herself may be leading them...
12854,Dimitri: ...
12855,"Gilbert: If House Riegan can reconcile with House Gloucester sooner than later... Then Claude can proceed with his plan to rally the Alliance lords, gather troops, and invade Empire territory."
12856,"Rodrigue: At this rate, three military forces will be clashing at Gronder Field."
12857,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Just like five years ago...
Choice 2: Just like the Battle of the Eagle and Lion..."
12858,Choice 1: Just like five years ago...
12859,Choice 2: Just like the Battle of the Eagle and Lion...
12860,"Dimitri: If you wish to indulge in nostalgia, do it elsewhere."
12861,"Rodrigue: I'm afraid the difference in military strength is far from negligible. While we are elite soldiers, I am still uneasy about this..."
12862,"Gilbert: If possible, I'd like to request reinforcements right away. If we can rely on any of the major Kingdom houses for military support, it would be...House Charon, I'd wager."
12863,Byleth: Why them?
12864,Gilbert: House Charon has yet to declare fealty to the Empire.
12865,"Catherine: It is also...my home. I will make the request to my father. With things as they are, I don't think he can refuse. The church has long protected me. I am certain that any request from the church will be answered to the utmost of their ability."
12866,"Rodrigue: Very well. We're counting on you, Catherine."
12867,Gilbert: I suppose that is all we can do for now.
12868,"Rodrigue: So it would seem. Though, if there are any other avenues worth exploring, I would suggest..."
12869,Byleth: Allying with the Alliance?
12870,"Gilbert: Ah, good point. We have no reason to engage the Alliance directly."
12871,"Rodrigue: Even if we do receive Count Charon's aid, we still won't have the troops we need to face the Empire."
12872,"Gilbert: But if we join forces with the Alliance, then our numbers will rival the Empire's."
12873,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's join forces.
Gilbert: Agreed. It's about the only thing we can do.
Choice 2: Let's wait and see.
Gilbert: If we wait too long, we'll lose the advantage..."
12874,"Choice 1: Let's join forces.
Gilbert: Agreed. It's about the only thing we can do."
12875,Gilbert: Agreed. It's about the only thing we can do.
12876,"Choice 2: Let's wait and see.
Gilbert: If we wait too long, we'll lose the advantage..."
12877,"Gilbert: If we wait too long, we'll lose the advantage..."
12878,"Gilbert: For now, let's send a messenger, and try to figure out what the Alliance hopes to achieve."
12879,Rodrigue: It's hard to believe this decisive battle will take place at Gronder Field... I image that place is full of memories for all of you.
12880,Mercedes: We won the Battle of the Eagle and Lion back in the day. It seems like a lifetime ago...
12881,"Ashe: I can't help but remember, even though I wish I didn't."
12882,Ingrid: Our feast after the battle... I remember it well. We all had so much fun together.
12883,"Annette: No! Please, stop it. I had finally put all of that out of my mind... This isn't right. They're our friends! We used to study together. We shouldn't be fighting them."
12884,"Sylvain: Why not march up to Her Majesty and remind her of that? Oh, that's right...because you want to live to see tomorrow."
12885,"Dedue: No matter who the enemy is, I will fight for His Highness."
12886,"Felix: Tell me, boar prince. Do we stand a chance?"
12887,Dimitri: Who knows...
12888,"Felix: If we lose, we'll have died for you. I hope you know that."
12889,Dimitri: ...
12890,"Rodrigue: That's enough, Felix. We must focus on the battle ahead."
12891,"Dimitri: Make your peace before we depart. It's kill or be killed out there. We will cross blades with the Empire, but it's possible we will also have to strike down the Alliance."
12892,Gilbert: Your Highness... Do you feel no hesitation about killing your former friends?
12893,"Dimitri: If they must die, I will kill them. Nothing could be simpler."
12894,Dimitri: I can finally kill her... Finally... I can avenge them...
12895,"Dedue: You have my sincerest gratitude. Circumstances, and my wounds, have prevented me from being by His Highness's side these five years. I am grateful that you have found him for me. I am once again in your debt."
12896,"Felix: As powerful as our knights are, we're outnumbered. By a long shot. This won't be easy. It's crazy to attempt this. I guess I'm crazy to go along with it."
12897,"Ashe: If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain."
12898,"Sylvain: Say we do manage to take down Edelgard here... What do you think His Highness will do next? As long as there's a plan, I won't complain. I just, you know, wanna know there is a plan."
12899,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Continue on to the Imperial capital?
Sylvain: Yeah, I suppose that's the most likely plan since we're traveling with the church and everything.
Choice 2: Head to the Kingdom capital first?
Sylvain: Heh, well, I'd be happy if that were the case, but I don't figure that'll actually happen. All this isn't just going to magically end the moment we kill Edelgard. It's gone too far.
Choice 3: I don't know...
Sylvain: Heh, well, if even you can't say, I guess it's not surprising the rest of us don't know either."
12900,"Choice 1: Continue on to the Imperial capital?
Sylvain: Yeah, I suppose that's the most likely plan since we're traveling with the church and everything."

12905,"Sylvain: Heh, well, if even you can't say, I guess it's not surprising the rest of us don't know either."
12906,Sylvain: I suppose we should focus on the battle right in front of us instead of what happens later.
12907,"Mercedes: So, we're finally going to set foot in the Empire... I'm starting to get a little nervous. I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out."
12908,"Annette: The thought of fighting people who were once our friends...it makes my heart heavy. If it was gonna come to this, maybe I should have avoided making friends with people from the Empire and the Alliance to begin with..."
12909,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You might be right.
Annette: You think so too, Professor? I'm glad it's not just me.
Choice 2: I don't think that's the right attitude.
Annette: I just don't know, Professor. I'm having a hard time with it."
12910,"Choice 1: You might be right.
Annette: You think so too, Professor? I'm glad it's not just me."
12911,"Annette: You think so too, Professor? I'm glad it's not just me."

12913,"Annette: I just don't know, Professor. I'm having a hard time with it."
12914,"Annette: It did often seem strange to me at the academy that we were studying with all these people from all over the world. But I feel like I've finally started to understand the real reason behind it. The more you get to know people from other places, the harder you'll try to avoid fighting wars with them..."
12915,Ingrid: Yet another grand battle awaits. Many will lose their lives.
12916,"Byleth:
Choice 1: There's no way around it.
Ingrid: I am well aware. This is war, after all.
Choice 2: Let's fight our hardest to stay alive. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: Yes, let's. We must both make it home in one piece."

Ingrid: Yes, let's. We must both make it home in one piece."
12920,"Ingrid: Yes, let's. We must both make it home in one piece."
12921,Ingrid: Even considering those we are up against--friends from a time now past--I won't hold back.
12922,"Ferdinand: We captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but the fight has only just begun. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting for us on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves."
12923,"Linhardt: I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?"
12924,"Caspar: After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip..."
12925,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!
Choice 2: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!"
12926,"Choice 1: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. (Relationship with Caspar up)

12930,"Bernadetta: So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that."
12931,"Dorothea: The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified that it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died. (if Ferdinand was not recruited) And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?"
12932,"Petra: Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning..."
12933,"Byleth:
Choice 1: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
Choice 2: For personal gain. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?"
12934,"Choice 1: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal."
12935,Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
12936,"Choice 2: For personal gain. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?"
12937,Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?
12938,"Lorenz: So, Claude and my father have made peace. That is to be expected. They both prioritize their own interests above all else. So long as those interests are in alignment, they will continue to cooperate. And based on that reasoning, one might infer that the Alliance should be also willing to work with the Kingdom's military. I highly doubt Claude would refuse to assist us, if we were to ask."
12939,"Raphael: I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield."
12940,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Everyone gets that feeling. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?
Choice 2: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"
12941,"Choice 1: Everyone gets that feeling. (Relationship with Raphael up)

12944,"Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"
12945,"Raphael: Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth."
12946,"Ignatz: Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of Fódlan--a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint."
12947,"Lysithea: I'm glad you're the one giving orders on the battlefield, Professor. I don't think we should trust Dimitri with that task... Although it's thanks to his obsession that we're wasting no time, taking the shortest route to defeating the Empire. I just can't see a bright future for this army, fighting as we are under the banner of a prince possessed. Even if we do succeed in defeating the Empire, I wonder what will become of Fódlan. I apologize. Whenever I'm with you, I speak more openly than I should. Please keep this between us."
12948,"Marianne: The situation in the Alliance has changed so much, but I haven't heard a word from my adoptive father... Do you think he's forgotten about me?"
12949,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sure he's just busy. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: If that's the case, I hope he gets even busier.
Choice 2: I'm sure that's not the case.
Marianne: I'm not overly concerned about him..."
12950,"Choice 1: I'm sure he's just busy. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: If that's the case, I hope he gets even busier."
12951,"Marianne: If that's the case, I hope he gets even busier."
12952,"Choice 2: I'm sure that's not the case.
Marianne: I'm not overly concerned about him..."
12953,Marianne: I'm not overly concerned about him...
12954,Marianne: I'd actually be happier if he really did forget about me. Everything would be so much easier...
12955,"Hilda: I heard the next battle might take us to Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?"
12956,Leonie: I heard Edelgard is going to be leading her forces personally in the next battle. Seems pretty reckless to charge right into this one. I'm not sure I like our chances. What do you think?
12957,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't worry. I can handle it. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better.
Choice 2: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
12958,"Choice 1: Don't worry. I can handle it. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better."
12959,"Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better."
12960,"Choice 2: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
12961,"Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
12962,"Leonie: Anyway, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get."
12963,"Seteth: Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire."
12964,"Flayn: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?"
12965,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly.
Choice 2: After. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: I am glad you have not forgotten."
12966,"Choice 1: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly."
12967,"Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly."
12968,"Choice 2: After. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: I am glad you have not forgotten."
12969,Flayn: I am glad you have not forgotten.
12970,Flayn: It was shortly after I joined your class--I remember it like it was yesterday.
12971,"Hanneman: When undertaking research, the usual method is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research."
12972,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Choice 2: I don't understand."
12973,Choice 1: Sorry about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
12974,Choice 2: I don't understand.
12975,"Hanneman: Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find out, eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!"
12976,"Manuela: I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!"
12977,"Gilbert: Catherine will surely be able to convince Count Charon. All that remains is to wait for a response from the Alliance side... For now, there are preparations to be made for the coming battle."
12978,Gilbert: Catherine has successfully convinced Count Charon. However... The knights we sent to the Alliance have yet to return.
12979,"Alois: Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy."
12980,"Catherine: Hey, Professor. It’s been a while... Well, actually not that long. If you’re here about the reinforcements, no need to worry. I’ve sorted everything out with my father. If the Alliance agrees to chip in as well, we might have a real chance at victory."
12981,"Shamir: Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead."
12982,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic.
Choice 2: Understood. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic."
12983,"Choice 1: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic."
12984,"Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic."
12985,"Choice 2: Understood. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic."
12986,Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic.
12987,Shamir: Don't waste your energy worrying about me.
12988,"Cyril: I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back."
12989,"Rodrigue: Hm? Oh, it's you, Professor. Sorry, I was a little lost in thought there. About all that has happened, and all that is to come... I'm sure the battles ahead will not be easy, but please take good care of His Highness."
12990,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of Fódlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!"
12991,Maiden: Um...thank you. For bringing me here. I've been given permission to take part in this next mission too. I'll finally be able to avenge my brother! I swear... I'll take down that monster!
12992,Monk: I once saw the prince patting the head of an orphan from the monastery. Does this mean even that cruel man has some empathy in his heart? Was it just a random whim? Maybe my eyes just tricked me...
12993,"Soldier: I can hardly believe we're crossing the borders of the Empire to battle their army. I never thought I'd see the day. You'd never guess from the calm looks on everyone's faces, though... I mean, we're probably all gonna die, let's be honest. His Highness, Lord Rodrigue, you... There's really something wrong with the lot of you, I swear..."
12994,"Merchant: Yeah... You know, war really is terrible. People die, food becomes scarce... Weapons and rations start selling like hotcakes, nobles start begging for loans... Oh, um, I didn't mean... I didn't mean for that to sound so cold, really. Anyway, where are we off to this time? I hope it's the Alliance..."
12995,"Soldier: Edelgard's presence suggests that Hubert is around too. He is Minister of the Imperial Household, after all. He's been around Edelgard since they were children. I suppose he must be pretty happy with his current position."
12996,"Knight of Seiros: So, we're finally moving into enemy territory... We can expect the war to get even more intense from here on out. I'm really feeling the tension now. I have almost no experience with battles of this scale. Professor... I'll be grateful for your leadership on the battlefield. I know I can trust you!"
12997,"Yuri: That Duke Fraldarius is a rather upstanding guy. Getting into his good graces isn't without challenges. If he were a bit more corrupt, he'd be much more pliable."
12998,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Enough with that.
Choice 2: Oh? (Relationship with Yuri up)"
12999,Choice 1: Enough with that.
13000,Choice 2: Oh? (Relationship with Yuri up)
13001,"Yuri: I'm not trying to pull anything funny. Just noting that he's a respectable soldier. I hear he's the sort to have drinks with his men, getting to know them personally. Just last night, he and Felix had a chat. I'm sure there's a lot to work out between them."
13002,"Balthus: We've seen the face of evil. One of it's faces, at least. Even the Alliance is involved now... Hopefully we can avoid dragging Alliance territory through the horrors of war. I may have cut ties with my family, but I still want them to be safe and all..."
13003,"Constance: Across the bridge is Bergliez territory. It marks the start of our incursion into the Empire. Worry not. I feel no trepidation as we do this. Mark how my spellcraft carries us through to Enbarr, heart of the Empire!"
13004,"Hapi: We're fighting people we used to know from the Officers Academy. Guess that's the kind of thing that happens in war, but...still. It's pretty twisted. It makes me feel so... Oof. Maybe I'll just try not to think about it."
13005,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. The Great Tree Moon is finally upon us. It's time to celebrate a new year. We only get so many! Folks up top don't seem to be in the mood to celebrate though. I hate war..."
13006,"Resident: Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here. I'm hiding from the army. I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home. Justice, ambition--what does any of that matter if you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?"
13007,"Resident: I used to be a rather important person in the church, but...I am in exile for committing a crime. I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed! My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church wasn't putting in enough to rebuild..."
13008,Rogue: What a pain. What an absolute pain.
13009,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What's the matter?
Rogue: Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice. Here's a word of warning--if anyone here asks you for a favor, it's probably just a scam.
Choice 2: ...
Rogue: ..."
13010,"Choice 1: What's the matter?
Rogue: Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice. Here's a word of warning--if anyone here asks you for a favor, it's probably just a scam."
13011,"Rogue: Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice. Here's a word of warning--if anyone here asks you for a favor, it's probably just a scam."
13012,"Choice 2: ...
Rogue: ..."
13013,Rogue: ...
13014,"Soldier: Whenever I think about the next battle, my knees won't stop shaking. I'm scared of getting hurt, or worse... Is there a medicinal herb I can use to calm my nerves?"
13015,"Soldier: It really calms you down if you make a tea out of it. Ah, even the smell is soothing! Thank you so much. Now I feel like I can fight again."
13016,Gilbert: There's quite a bit of fog settling in. We won't be able to advance our troops very far in this.
13017,"Rodrigue: We won't be able to move at all until the fog lifts, no matter which path we take. We'll have to be patient and wait it out. ... Gilbert. No... Gustave. I would like to take this opportunity to speak with you about something. It's about the Tragedy of Duscur. There's something about it I just can't wrap my head around."
13018,Gilbert: I'm listening.
13019,Rodrigue: I lost a son in Duscur that day. I exhausted every last resource I had to investigate what took place there. I was startled to find that...there wasn't a single shred of evidence to suggest that Lady Patricia's carriage had been attacked.
13020,Gilbert: Go on...
13021,"Rodrigue: Apart from His Highness, whose injuries left him on the verge of death, everyone else present at the time was slaughtered. Of all the victims, only the corpse of Lady Patricia, His Majesty's second wife, was never found. Isn't that right?"
13022,"Gilbert: Hmm... Surely that means she was abducted. There was no evidence of an attack, suggesting they threatened her but did not kill her..."
13023,Rodrigue: But what reason would they have to take her? Would it not have been better to kill her?
13024,Gilbert: Perhaps she had some value as a diplomatic pawn.
13025,"Rodrigue: Nonsense. In the many years since that day, has Lady Patricia ever been used thus?"
13026,Gilbert: No... Not as far as I know. Then perhaps she was used for some political gain within the Empire.
13027,"Rodrigue: Now that her daughter is the emperor, what reason would she have to keep hiding her existence?"
13028,Gilbert: It is possible she passed away after returning to the Empire...
13029,"Rodrigue: Gustave, I know this is hard for you to hear, but just consider what it would mean if Lady Patricia was involved with that incident..."
13030,"Gilbert: Silence, Rodrigue. I will not allow you to tarnish her memory like that."
13031,"Rodrigue: I do not mean to imply that she arranged His Majesty's murder or anything of the like. But Gustave... I cannot shake the feeling that the tragedy was part of a much larger conspiracy. There is more to it than we know, that much is certain..."
13032,"Kingdom Soldier: Rodrigue! Gilbert! Please, hurry!"
13033,Gilbert: To kill like this...is inhuman.
13034,Rodrigue: This is one of the knights who was dispatched to the leader of the Alliance. Tell me everything you know.
13035,Kingdom Soldier: Sir! A soldier on patrol came across this knight a short while ago in a rocky area not far from here. Someone from the Alliance must have disposed of the body there...
13036,Gilbert: Is this how the Alliance chose to inform us that they have no intention of joining our cause?
13037,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Could Claude really have done this?
Rodrigue: The Alliance lords each have their own motives. It's difficult to say for sure who was behind this.
Choice 2: Maybe it was the Empire...
Dimitri: Yes. I would not hesitate to believe them capable of this."
13038,"Choice 1: Could Claude really have done this?
Rodrigue: The Alliance lords each have their own motives. It's difficult to say for sure who was behind this."
13039,Rodrigue: The Alliance lords each have their own motives. It's difficult to say for sure who was behind this.
13040,"Choice 2: Maybe it was the Empire...
Dimitri: Yes. I would not hesitate to believe them capable of this."
13041,Dimitri: Yes. I would not hesitate to believe them capable of this.
13042,"Rodrigue: Whatever the truth is, the other knights we dispatched are in serious danger. It's best to assume that joining with the Alliance is out of the question now."
13043,"Gilbert: Even with Count Charon's support, this makes our situation grim..."
13044,Dimitri: I never expected the Alliance to help us. Anyone who stands in my way will be crushed beneath my feet...
13045,"Maiden: It is time, dear Brother..."
13046,Dimitri: Know that I will tear your heads from your shoulders. The dead must have their tribute.
13047,Claude: As big class reunions go...this one's gotta be the worst in history.
13048,"Edelgard: Years ago, we fought here as classmates. But not today."
13049,Dimitri: Kill every last one of them!
13050,Edelgard: And so we fight on.
13051,Suggested Level: 33
13052,Victory Conditions: Defeat all enemy commanders.
13053,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
13054,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
13055,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle.
13056,"Dimitri: You have finally appeared, Edelgard. Now you are mine."
13057,Claude: The Kingdom army doesn't look interested in joining forces. Let's take a moment and see how this Unfolds...
13058,Edelgard: It would not be advantageous to take on both at once. We must stop the Kingdom and the Alliance from joining forces. I will create such chaotic warfare that will not be able to tell who is friend and who is foe.
13059,Edelgard: Mounted units. Advance!
13060,Petra: The center is in danger of being taken. We must be running to protect it! (If Petra was not recruited)
13061,Imperial General: There are enemies in the central area... We need to head there immediately to protect it! (If Petra was recruited)
13062,Claude: Hmph. The Empire and Kingdom are mixed up in this battle. It's a struggle to target the right one. Such are the rules of Melee. We'll just have to crush anyone who isn't an ally!
13063,Claude: They wanna crush us before the Imperial Army? Then we'll show them what we'll made of!
13064,"Leonie: Great! I may not have a Crest, but I'll give it my all. (If Leonie was not recruited)"
13065,Hilda: I'm not going to hold back. I can't let down my dear old Claude. (If Hilda was not recruited)
13066,"Edelgard: Those fools who went up the central hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames! (Wooden central hill platform becomes filled with flames)
(alternate) This is not as I planned, but there is nothing to be done. Burn the central hill!"
13067,"(alternate) This is not as I planned, but there is nothing to be done. Burn the central hill!"
13068,Hubert: The central hill is up in smoke. Suppose I'll have to quench the flames - with the enemy's blood. (Hubert starts moving towards the central hill)
13069,Lysithea: Don't expect me to go easy on you. Because I won't.
13070,Lysithea: I thought I'd be able to live...just a little bit longer than...this.
13071,"Claude: Lysithea... She burned too brightly, and faded too fast... (If Claude was not defeated)"
13072,Ignatz: I am helping Claude build the future of Fódlan!
13073,Ignatz: It's over for me. I did my best
13074,"Claude: I'm sorry, Ignatz... I wasn't able to save you... (If Claude was not defeated)"
13075,"Leonie: I can't hold back just because I know you. Sorry, but that's war."
13076,"Leonie: S-so this is it. I did what I could, Captain Jeralt..."
13077,Claude: Leonie fell? Did I underestimate the enemy? (If Claude was not defeated)
13078,Raphael: There's no way you're gonna beat me! You're better off turning tail and running away!
13079,"Raphael: Wow, it's sure been a while! You're a tough opponent, Professor!"
13080,Raphael: Claude... Take care of my little sis...and the Alliance...
13081,"Claude: Raphael! Don't worry, I promise to look after your sister... (If Claude was not defeated)"
13082,"Hilda: You didn't forget about me, did you? Maybe you should just let me go."
13083,Hilda: I have to get out of here! I'll die if I don't.
13084,"Claude: Hilda, you've done well. Leave the rest to me. (If Claude was not defeated)"
13085,Claude: So sad that our reunion should take place on the battlefield.
13086,"Claude: So, you're actually alive, Teach! It's a shame you aren't on our side. Anyway, isn't the Empire your enemy? Us fighting seems like a waste..."
13087,"Claude: Calm down, Dimitri! What does it achieve, us killing each other here?"
13088,"Dimitri: Move, Claude. I have no time to exchange words with you."
13089,"Claude: It doesn't matter what I'm saying, does it? You aren't even listening. But I'm not gonna budge."
13090,"Claude: Arrgh... I thought we had a chance, but there was no way to predict the movements of the Kingdom army. I can't afford to die here. I have to retreat."
13091,Bernadetta: Stay back! Stay back or I'll shoot.
13092,Bernadetta: Professor? Is that you? You're with the enemy. That means I... I'll have to kill you.
13093,"Bernadetta: Wish I could've at least died at home... not in this big, stupid field..."
13094,"Edelgard: Bernadetta, thank you. I'll make sure your life was not lost in vain. (If Edelgard was not defeated)"
13095,Petra: For Adrestia and for Brigid... I will be defeating all of you!
13096,Petra: I can't be fighting anymore... I must be retreating now...
13097,Edelgard: Don't worry. You must live on to lead your people. Those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames! (Wooden central hill platform becomes filled with flames)
13098,Hubert: You're interfering with the plan. Looks like I'll just have to get rid of you.
13099,"Hubert: Fighting on will endanger my life. Your Majesty, I must withdraw."
13100,"Edelgard: No need to worry. We still have some troops left. So long as I stand, we won't give up."
13101,"Edelgard: I will destroy both the Kingdom and the Alliance. Now, with one fell swoop!"
13102,"Edelgard: I knew when next we met one of our paths would have to come to an end. Your journey ends here, Professor. Forever..."
13103,"Dimitri: Stab your chest, break your neck, smash your head... I will allow you to choose your own death."
13104,"Edelgard: I'm not interested in methods of dying. All that matters is when death takes place, not how. And I have no intention of dying today."
13105,Dimitri: I'm sure all of the people you've slaughtered so far thought the same!
13106,"Edelgard: I lost?! Just as expected, you aren't making my path an easy one. I must retreat for now. We'll meet again on the battlefield."
13107,"Dimitri: So, you think you can escape, Edelgard?"
13108,Rodrigue: Your Highness! You're alive! We have to retreat to the Great Bridge of Myrddin...
13109,"Dimitri: That woman...we failed to capture her. I'll keep pursuing. The rest of you, keep fighting!"
13110,"Rodrigue: I'm so sorry...but we can't do that. I understand how you feel, but the Imperial army is closing in!"
13111,Dimitri: I'll kill all of them! No matter how many hundreds or thousands of them they are!
13112,Fleche: ...
13113,"Rodrigue: You... What are you doing here?! It's too dangerous! Fall back, now!"
13114,Fleche: Heh.
13115,Rodrigue: Your Highness!
13116,Dimitri: You...are...
13117,"Fleche: Have I caught you off guard, Your Highness? Aww, does it hurt? I bet it hurts reaaaal bad, doesn't it? But it's nothing compared to what my brother felt! You will never be forgiven, you know. I will never forgive you!"
13118,Dimitri: You... You must be...
13119,Fleche: You filthy monster! It's time to DIIIIE!
13120,Rodrigue: Dimitri!
13121,Rodrigue: Gah... P-Professor... Do it now!
13122,Fleche: Agahhhh! B-Brother... Help... me...
13123,Dimitri: Rodrigue!
13124,Rodrigue: Your Highness... Are you safe? Please tell me... it wasn't in vain...
13125,Dimitri: This punishment... it was mine to bear.
13126,Rodrigue: There are no sins or punishments... on the battlefield...
13127,"Dimitri: NO! Don't die... Please, don't die! Father, Stepmother, Glenn... They all died and left me behind. Rodrigue... Are you to join the ghosts who shadow my every move? This is my fault... I... I'm the one who killed you, as surely as though I had wielded the blade!"
13128,"Rodrigue: Heh. Your Highness. You have one thing... terribly wrong. None of them... none of us... died for you. I'm dying for what I believe in... just as they did. Your life is your own. It belongs to no other, living or dead. Live for what you believe in. Dimitri... My boy... You really do look just like His Majesty..."
13129,"Rodrigue: What are you saying, Lambert?!"
13130,"Lambert: I am heading to Duscur. And before you start, nothing you could say would change my mind. You worry too much, my friend. So far relations with Duscur have been going smoothly, wouldn't you say? You of all people should appreciate how critical these negotiations are."
13131,"Rodrigue: Of course I do, but... for the king himself to make the journey... You must admit that it's dangerous. And His Highness is still so young. If the worst should happen..."
13132,"Lambert: Even if the worst should happen, he would be OK. He's a smart boy, Rodrigue. Even if he should lose his father, I have no doubt that he will grow to be a good and respectable man."
13133,Rodrigue: Lambert...
13134,"Lambert: However... If he ever starts down the wrong path and I am not here to set him straight, I am trusting you to do so in my stead, old friend. Promise me."
13135,Rodrigue: Lambert... My promise... I...
13136,Dimitri: What do you want?
13137,Byleth: Where are you going?
13138,Dimitri: It doesn't concern you.
13139,Byleth: It does.
13140,Dimitri: Get out of my way. Now.
13141,"Byleth: You're going to Enbarr, aren't you?"
13142,Dimitri: ...
13143,Byleth: Do you really think that will appease the dead?
13144,"Dimitri: Silence. You have no idea what you're talking about. Death is the end. No matter how much lingering regret a person has, after death, they are powerless. They cannot even wish for revenge, much less seek it out. Hatred. Regret. Those burdens fall on the shoulders of those who are left behind. And so I must continue down this path! I already told you as much! It is far too late to stop."
13145,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're wrong.
Choice 2: There must be another way."
13146,Choice 1: You're wrong.
13147,Choice 2: There must be another way.
13148,"Dimitri: Do not waste your breath with some nonsense about how I should move on with my life for their sake. That is merely the logic of the living. It's meaningless. Those who died with lingering regret... They will not loose their hold on me so easily. But you seem to have all the answers... So tell me, professor. Please, tell me... How do I silence their desperate pleas? How do I... How do I save them? Ever since that day nine years ago... I have lived only to avenge the fallen. Even my time at the Officers Academy was all so that I could secure my revenge and clear away the regret of the dead. It was the only thing that kept me alive... My only reason to keep moving forward..."

Choice 1: You must forgive yourself.
Choice 2: You've suffered enough."
13150,Choice 1: You must forgive yourself.
13151,Choice 2: You've suffered enough.
13152,Dimitri: Hmph.
13153,Dimitri: But then who... or what... should I live for?
13154,Byleth: Live for what you believe in.
13155,"Dimitri: What I believe in... Rodrigue said the same thing. But is it possible... I am a murderous monster. My hands are stained red. Could one such as I truly hope for such a life? As the sole survivor of that day, do I... Do I have the right to live for myself?"
13156,Dimitri: ...
13157,Dimitri: Your hands are so warm... Have they always been?

13161,"Following the death of Rodrigue, Dimitri begins to question his desire for revenge. His troubled mind turns to the kingdom capital and how he might end the chaos plaguing Faerghus, once and for all.
"
13162,"I'm sorry...
"
13163,"I...
"
13164,"He has to atone...
"
13165,"I may be from Faerghus...
"
13166,"We're old friends...
"
13167,"I agree, but...
"
13168,"It's been way too long.
"
13169,"I know we can win.
"
13170,"They're just legends...
"
13171,"Can you believe it?
"
13172,"We fight, then fight again...
"
13173,"The most importance...
"
13174,"We're finally going to Fhirdiad...
"
13175,"You gotta be nice to 'em!
"
13176,"Gruesome, isn't it?
"
13177,"I'm relieved too.
"
13178,"I used to think death meant so little...
"
13179,"Fhirdiad, eh?
"
13180,"He's completely changed...
"
13181,"It may be a more roundabout route...
"
13182,"It broke my heart...
"
13183,"Did you know, there's a school of sorcery...
"
13184,"That was really tough...
"
13185,"We need to be wary...
"
13186,"I trust your judgement...
"
13187,"Ridiculous...
"
13188,"Guess what I noticed.
"
13189,"No laughing matter...

13192,"The Kingdom capital is beautiful.
"

"
13194,"So many victories! Exciting.
"
13195,"Ignorance is bliss.
"
13196,"What's Cornelia's up to...
"
13197,"Despite their victory at the Battle of Gronder, the Kingdom army turns around and marches for Fhirdiad instead of heading south.To hail the arrival of the Kingdom army, the people of Fhirdiad begin to rebel. No move is made to suppress them. Instead, Cornelia directs her borrowed Imperial troops to prevent Dimitri from reaching the Kingdom capital.

13199,Gilbert: Our victory at Gronder was certainly a turning point for us. However... Rodrigue's death has been difficult to bear. We've lost considerable military strength and resources.
13200,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are there no lords we can rely on?
Choice 2: Is there no way to secure more soldiers?"
13201,Choice 1: Are there no lords we can rely on?
13202,Choice 2: Is there no way to secure more soldiers?
13203,"Sylvain: Unfortunately, with things as they are now, I don't think House Gautier has any resources to spare."
13204,Ingrid: I'm sorry. I really wish we could help. If only house Galatea had anything to give...
13205,"Gilbert: If we split up the soldiers currently defending the monastery, we should have sufficient numbers to invade the Empire. But even then..."
13206,Dedue: Your highness! You should be resting. Your wounds are still healing...
13207,"Dimitri: I am well, I assure you. More importantly... may I have a moment of your time?"
13208,"Dimitri: Thank you. I wish to apologize. To all of you. I have led you down this dark path with me, and have cost so much suffering along the way... I cannot tell you how sorry I am for my behavior. There is no apology I could offer that would be sufficient."
13209,Felix: Hmph. And how do you intend to make up for my father's death?
13210,"Dimitri: Felix... I realize words alone are not enough to repent, but I fear they are all I have."
13211,Felix: I’m not after more empty words. I want you to speak through your actions.
13212,"Dimitri: ... I know that no amount of regret can ever bring back the lives we have lost. I... I know that well. It is like patching up a tear with a different material. Things can never be as they were. The best I can hope for is to make things whole again. I wish to do the right thing from now on. That is why I have made a decision... I intend to take back the kingdom capital. I wish to save our people, those who I turned my back on for far too long. To follow my heart and do the right thing... That's the only way I can atone for my sins."
13213,"Gilbert: Your highness... If we can win back Fhirdiad, it will give us the advantage in our war against the Empire. As one who has served the royal family for ages, know that your words bring me great joy. And pride. That said, I must point out that if we make for Fhirdiad, the Emperor's head will slip further out of reach. Can you live with that?"
13214,"Dimitri: I still hold hatred in my heart for her and for the ones responsible for the tragedy... That, I will carry with me until death. But... my life is my own. It belongs to no one else, and it is high time that I started living for what I believe in. I will no longer allow the voices of the dead to bind me. This is something that I must do... No. Something that I am choosing to do. I will accomplish my aim, even if it means risking my life to do so."
13215,"Gilbert: Understood, your highness. So? Any objections?"
13216,"Byleth:
Choice 1: None.
Choice 2: Count me in."
13217,Choice 1: None.
13218,Choice 2: Count me in.
13219,Seteth: You are correct. We cannot afford to die in vain by recklessly challenging the empire.
13220,"Mercedes: I'm worried about Lady Rhea... but if this is the choice you've made, I support it."
13221,"Dedue: I am at your command, your highness. I will follow you anywhere."
13222,"Ashe: My sword is at your service, your highness."
13223,Annette: I'll help too! The people in Fhirdiad need us!
13224,"Felix: Fine. I'll help you...in my father's stead. But in return, you must win. You know that, don't you...Dimitri?"
13225,Dimitri: I do. And I swear on my father's lance that we will prevail.
13226,"Gilbert: Then it is decided. It seems this war council has much to discuss. Our next stop is Fhirdiad, the Kingdom capital. For the future of Faerghus!"
13227,"Dimitri: I really caused trouble for you, didn't I... I am so sorry. Truly. I am also...eternally grateful to you. Now, it's time to go to the Kingdom capital. I hope that you will lend me your strength once again."
13228,"Dedue: Everyone is saying His Highness is back to his old self, but I do not think that is accurate. What he was until recently is what he had been for as long as I've known him. So tortured by his compassion for the fallen that it had driven him mad. He has always been too kind to be king. He has always felt too much for the weak and the dead. That is exactly why I look up to him."
13229,"Felix: He'll need to excel as a leader, if he's to make up for my old man's death. Though if my father could see Dimitri now, he's be glad to have made the sacrifice. Don't you dare tell anyone I said that."
13230,"Ashe: I was born and raised in Faerghus, but I've never actually been to Fhirdiad. Do you think it'll still be cold at this time of year? I can't even imagine."
13231,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We should prepare for the cold.
Ashe: You're right. It's an important battle, so let's make sure we're ready for anything.
Choice 2: Maybe we should ask someone. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: Good point. I'll check with His Highness."
13232,"Choice 1: We should prepare for the cold.

13235,Ashe: Good point. I'll check with His Highness.
13236,"Sylvian: I don't feel like I can just forget all the awful stuff he's done... But if His Highness is owning up to his past, and trying to move forward... I figure I can give him that chance. We've been friends since we were kids. I'm gonna be there for him all the way to the end."
13237,"Mercedes: I agree that we should head for Fhirdiad, but let's not forget our search for Lady Rhea! The soldiers from the church are going to set up a base at the Great Bridge of Myrddin. They'll be able to keep up the search while we head for the Kingdom capital!"
13238,"Annette: The Kingdom capital... It's been way too long since I was there last... Oh, Professor! I didn't mean, ah.. It's not that I'm looking forward to it or anything."
13239,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You don't have to hide it. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: Ah! Please don't tease me like that!
Choice 2: This isn't a vacation.
Annette: I know that! We're preparing for battle!"
13240,"Choice 1: You don't have to hide it. (Relationship with Annette up)

Annette: I know that! We're preparing for battle!"
13243,Annette: I know that! We're preparing for battle!
13244,"Annette: It's just... when I think of us finally saving everyone in Fhirdiad, it makes me a little happy. OK, maybe a lot happy. The Kingdom capital is under the tight control of Cornelia, who was ennobled by the Empire. Judging by what we heard from Lord Rodrigue, it sounds like she's a tyrant. But all of that ends soon. Let's get there quickly!"
13245,"Ingrid: We buried Lord Rodrigue's body ourselves. There wasn't a time to do things properly. It pains me that I was unable to take him home to his territory. Once this war is over, I'd like to hold a proper funeral for him. For now, we need to focus on taking back Fhirdiad. All will be well eventually. I know we can win."
13246,"Ferdinand: Dimitri hated the Empire with a fiery passion. At Gronder, driven by fury, he sent many good knights to their doom... Now he appears to be freed from that hatred. If he can make thoughtful decisions, unswayed by his emotions, he may make a fine king someday."
13247,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Kings are only human.
Ferdinand: No, they are not. A king must strive to be a king first and a human second.
Choice 2: Kings can't have feelings? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: No, they cannot. Kingly judgment has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual."
13248,"Choice 1: Kings are only human.

13251,"Ferdinand: No, they cannot. Kingly judgment has to be wholly separate from the emotions of the individual."
13252,"Linhardt: There are stories of Heroes' relics a thousand years ago of which we have no real evidence today. So many, in fact, that I'm led to wonder if those Relics are nothing more than legends. Especially since we know of relics like those passed down in the families of the 10 Fódlan Elites."
13253,"Caspar: Can you believe it, Professor? Dimitri actually apologized to me! Remember that awful business between him and my uncle Randoph? He just came by and said he was sorry for all of that. That was behind us so far as I was concerned, but even so... It seem like he's changed for the better."
13254,"Bernadetta: It's always so peaceful coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And now we're headed to the Kingdom? That sounds hard! Oh, really hard! Don't you think?!"
13255,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's going to be tough. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew you— Ow! Oh ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door...

13260,"Dorothea: So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent."
13261,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Though the actors die, the show goes on? (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected.
Choice 2: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened."

13266,Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.

13268,"Lorenz: It seems we will soon set food in Fhirdiad. I used to live there, you know. Though that was before my time in the Officers Academy."
13269,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Were you a hostage?
Lorenz: No, of course not. There is a school of magic there, which I was enrolled in for a time.
Choice 2: Were you a traveler? (Relationship with Lorenz up)

13270,"Choice 1: Were you a hostage?

13273,Lorenz: That's right I was enrolled at the school of magic there for a time.
13274,Lorenz: Trouble within the Kingdom forced me to return to Alliance lands. There was much I had yet to learn.
13275,"Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired."
13276,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, ""how""? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...

13281,"Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"
13282,"Ignatz: The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look away—to close our eyes to the horrors of war."
13283,"Byleth:

Ignatz: As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.

13289,Lysithea: I'm relieved the the prince seems to have finally come to his senses. Though it's a really shame that Lord Rodrigue passed away. It really is. But now I think we're starting to see a sliver of hope for the future of Fódlan.
13290,"Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died... But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little..."
13291,"Hilda: Fhirdiad huh? I've always wanted to go there. But I rather be visiting for fun, and during a warmer season. And going into battle? Not exactly an appealing prospect! Heh, I'm just teasing. I'll do what I can to help. I'm just so relieved that Dimitri is his old self again."
13292,"Leonie: Dimitri's completely changed. Or maybe I should say he's finally back to normal. Either way, I'm glad he's come around to the idea of retaking Fhirdiad. With our current troops, there's no way we could handle the Imperial capital. We wouldn't even get past Fort Merceus."
13293,"Seteth: It seems we are headed for the Kingdom capital this month. The Church of Seiros stands ready to lend its aid to you and Dimitri. It may be a roundabout route, but I believe this path will still eventually take us to Rhea. Besides—saving the people of Faerghus is just what she would want us to do."
13294,Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle... How inhuman is—how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.s
13295,"Hanneman: There's a school of sorcery in Fhirdiad, which is staffed by the top minds of magical research. The study of Crests and sorcery should not be separate. I've always thought I should pay them a visit someday. I never imagined I might end up invading the place with an army though. Not how I imagined it at all."
13296,"Manuela: Fighting with three different groups in the mix was as confusing as it was difficult to survive. Enemies and allies dying one of top of the other... What an absolute mess, huh? If only I had my infirmary out in Gronder, maybe I could have saved a few more lives."
13297,"Gilbert: I am very grateful to you. I could never have achieved this on my own. This is all thanks to you and Lord Rodrigue. This month, we will invade Fhirdiad by way of the Fraldarius domain. Leave the negotiations with House Fraldarius to me. You make ready for the actual battle. It is a tricky business, but we are taking our first steps forward."
13298,"Alois: The emperor was wounded at Gronder Field. What do you think is going on in the Empire now? The Leicester Alliance has really suffered a blow as well. Who knows what will become of them? From now on, we have to pay close attention to how the rest of Fódlan is doing."
13299,"Catherine: If we're headed to the Kingdom capital, that means we're further away from rescuing Lady Rhea. But it can't be helped, can it? Perhaps some people will question this decision, but I trust your judgement. Lady Rhea would want us to help in Fhirdiad. She'd scold us if we rescued her and left innocent people suffering."
13300,"Shamir: So we're turning around and heading for the Kingdom capital? Ridiculous. Tell him to cease this nonsense. Isn't there a saying in Fódlan. Something those with power knowing how to use it? If he's not careful, the goddess will send her saints to smite him. Not that I believe that..."
13301,"Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't see figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see."
13302,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least.
Choice 2: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."

13307,"Cyril: Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use."
13308,"Anna: A class reunion on the battlefield? That's...bleak. That must have been so hard on everyone. You gotta keep looking after them all. I mean, they still look to you for guidance, you know?"
13309,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Fhirdiad is a city with a long history that goes back to before Faerghus gained its independence. I'd like to visit that place at least once before I die, but I'm afraid I have my own work to attend to. It's hard being so dedicated! Ah well. I'll go there for some leisurely sightseeing once Fódlan knows peace!"
13310,"Churchgoer: I've come to deliver vegetables we harvested in the village to the monastery's dining hall. Because of the season, I couldn't really pick that much, but I wanted to help you guys out, even a little bit. We're busily planting seeds, so when things start to grow again, I'll be back."
13311,"Kingdom Knight: Up until a few decades ago, Fhirdiad was a disorderly city. Even the water supply was poorly constructed. As such, it was a hotbed of sickness and disease. The late king hired a researcher named Cornelia, who advised that he give top priority to improving the city's infrastructure. In the space of just a few years, the city was transformed into a place of beauty and order. At the same time, the diseases that had plagued our land loosened their grip, one after another. It was miraculous."
13312,"Knight: After that great battle earlier, the balance of power in Fódlan has shifted greatly... To get revenge for all our fallen friends, we'll have to stake our lives on the fight that lies before us."
13313,"Soldier: I can still hardly believe we managed to win against numbers like that! Oh... Unless the real me is lying dead in Gronder, and this is all just a happy dream..."
13314,"Soldier: Edelgard, Claude, His Highness... All the house leaders from way back when assembled again at Gronder. I wonder what their thoughts were as they headed out to the battleground."
13315,"Soldier: The fish in this pond get fed every day, so they're swimming all lazy and serene... But the only reason they're kept here is so that they can one day be used for food. But the fish don't know that, so they just swim around happily... It's a bit of a miserable thought, but aren't soldiers much the same?"
13316,"Merchant: If you manage to take back Fhirdiad, it'll make it a bit easier for us to do business. Taxes in the Fareghus Dukedom are ridiculously high. Makes it hard to even think about trading. That Cornelia woman... What does she use that ample tax money for, anyway? From the Empire's perspective, I suppose it makes sense to squeeze the former Kingdom territories for all they're worth... But if they throw those territories into total ruin, doesn't that defeat the purpose of conquering them?"
13317,Yuri: We've come so far... I hate that we're headed to the Kingdom capital now. But it's not like we have much choice. We don't have the numbers to face the Empire head on. So we've just gotta shut it and deal.
13318,"Balthus: Get this, pal. I swung by the training ground and ran into that Dimitri guy. Haven't seen him in ages. He seems less rabid, but he's still too damn serious. It's depressing. I challenged him to a brawl, hoping for a quick knockout. Didn't work out that way. We went at it for quite a while. He's a tough one."
13319,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're too reckless.
Balthus: What was I supposed to do? Invite him to tea? Trade hugs? Ha! Not in a million years, pal.
Choice 2: You should have invited me. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: True. The two of us could have taken him down, no problem."
13320,"Choice 1: You're too reckless.
Balthus: What was I supposed to do? Invite him to tea? Trade hugs? Ha! Not in a million years, pal."
13321,"Balthus: What was I supposed to do? Invite him to tea? Trade hugs? Ha! Not in a million years, pal."
13322,"Choice 2: You should have invited me. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: True. The two of us could have taken him down, no problem."
13323,"Balthus: True. The two of us could have taken him down, no problem."
13324,Balthus: Between you and me...the man is stunning in battle! Nearly on par with myself! Bet the ladies can't get enough.
13325,"Constance: It's a shame that our path is taking us far from the Imperial capital, but I don't feel too badly about it. It takes us closer to the Fhirdiad School of Sorcery, where I explored many branches of study. This way, I can repay my debt to the teachers who gave me such invaluable guidance."
13326,"Hapi: If we're going to the Kingdom capital, that means I'll run into the lady who... Well, you know."
13327,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You must be eager to face her. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: No, I'm definitely not in a rush to confront that one.
Choice 2: Your old archenemy...
Hapi: That's a bit much. I'm not nearly pompous enough to call anyone my ""archenemy."""
13328,"Choice 1: You must be eager to face her. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: No, I'm definitely not in a rush to confront that one."

Hapi: That's a bit much. I'm not nearly pompous enough to call anyone my ""archenemy."""
13331,"Hapi: That's a bit much. I'm not nearly pompous enough to call anyone my ""archenemy."""
13332,Hapi: We'll just have to see what happens when I meet her face-to-face.
13333,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear there was a huge battle recently. Glad to see you made it back safe and sound. Maybe there's life after death, or maybe that's just a bunch of pretty words. Either way, we should live like our time here is all we've got."
13334,Resident: Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?
13335,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No. The men aren't as few as that.
Resident: Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something.
Choice 2: Yes. Easily twice as many women.
Resident: No way. You got eyes? Take a look around."
13336,"Choice 1: No. The men aren't as few as that.
Resident: Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something."
13337,"Resident: Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something."
13338,"Choice 2: Yes. Easily twice as many women.
Resident: No way. You got eyes? Take a look around."
13339,Resident: No way. You got eyes? Take a look around.
13340,"Resident: I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff. There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five years on... It's just a fact of life. What? There have been lots of battles on the surface recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?!"
13341,"Resident: I've...been close with one of the Kingdom soldiers I met in town... He talked about how he hated the war. We'd just gotten engaged... I thought he'd stay... He didn't want to invade the Empire, but he left for the front anyway... He never came back..."
13342,"Gilbert: There is a demand for flowers, but we have not yet gathered enough. Would you lend us a hand, Professor? If possible, I would ask for the most beautiful flowers you can find."
13343,"Gilbert: His Highness visits the graveyard after every battle and places flowers on the graves of those who have fallen. Though it is hard for him to accept such loss, I believe he wishes to pay them the honor they deserve."
13344,"Dimitri: Fhirdiad... It has been a lifetime since I was last here. Five years ago, in fact. On the day before my execution, when Dedue helped me escape from prison. I killed soldiers from my homeland, stole weapons from their corpses, and made my escape, soaked in their blood. To think this is how I would return to the city of my birth, after all that has happened...
Byleth:
Choice 1: You have Rodrigue to thank.
Dimitri: Yes, Rodrigue gave his life to show me the way back to this path. You have risked much as well.
Choice 2: I'm proud of you.
Dimitri: I do not deserve that. If not for you or Rodrigue, I would still be lost..."

Dimitri: I do not deserve that. If not for you or Rodrigue, I would still be lost..."
13349,"Dimitri: I do not deserve that. If not for you or Rodrigue, I would still be lost..."
13350,"Dimitri: I am glad to have you at my side. From the bottom of my heart...I am forever grateful. Let's win this, Professor. Let's all make it out alive and celebrate our victory."
13351,"Gilbert: Your Highness. The path to the castle has been cleared. We are making preparations to advance. Say the word, and we march."
13352,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Give the order.
Choice 2: It's time!"
13353,Choice 1: Give the order.
13354,Choice 2: It's time!
13355,"Dimitri: Yes... Let us begin. Everyone! Listen well! This battle is for all that the Empire stole from us. It is a fight to reclaim the days of peace we once enjoyed. I give you but two commands—stay alive, and follow your heart. That is all I ask. The gates to the Kingdom capital are open. Join me! It is time to take back our home!"
13356,"Cornelia:I thought I would see you again, little princeling. Heh, so stubborn. It must run in your family."
13357,"Dukedom General: Cornelia! The city is overrun with insurrection. It seems to be in response to our enemy's arrival. If we do nothing, our army may suffer damages. We should suppress the citizens immediately."
13358,"Cornelia: The people are rebelling? Ha! Let them do as they please. Or are you saying you have enough soldiers to divide our forces? Quite bold of you, with our enemy's most elite soldiers at our doorstep."
13359,Dukedom General: But... What are you suggesting?
13360,"Cornelia: The city is going to be a battlefield anyway. Kill all who oppose us, even if they are members of the general populace. Go on now. You are needed out there."
13361,Dukedom General: As you wish. May we find fortune in the battle to come.
13362,Cornelia: Hmph. What an inconvenience the little princeling has turned out to be. And bringing that troublesome person along with him... It would have been much better if he and his sweet little stepsister had been good little children and just killed each other.
13363,"Felix: (Unused in the final game) Are you coming, boar prince? To think the day has finally come when we will cross swords..."
13364,Suggested Level: 35
13365,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
13366,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
13367,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
13368,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle.
13369,Cornelia: The preparations are all in place. Time to meet my old master. Ready the Titanus in the streets! Let's give them a welcome to remember.
13370,Dimitri: Advance! Smash that traitor Cornelia and reclaim the capital! I will not lose... I swear it by the blood in my veins...
13371,Dimitri: Bah! These things are surprisingly tough.. Are they being reinforced by magic?
13372,"Glibert: If there is magic in use, we should find the source and eliminate it."
13373,Cornelia: Weren't the Titanus enough for you? Well then! we had better active the Viskam!
13374,Dimitri: That should stop the supply of magic. Now we should be able to land attacks on those things.
13375,Gilbert: These strange devices and weapons... They are the Empire's? Unbelievable.
13376,Mercedes: Can't you put an end to this nonsense and come home? I'll even bake some of your favorite treats!
13377,"Annette: I love your treats, Mercie. They taste great, and they're really good with piping hot tea... I would have liked to enjoy them one more time... But I'm sorry. I can't return home just yet."
13378,Mercedes: Annie...
13379,"Gilbert: Annette, throw down your arms! Would you really fight your father?"
13380,"Annette: I can't do it, Father! I can't betray Mother and my uncle! If I have to defeat you, then so be it!"
13381,"Felix: Sylvain, stand aside. My blade thirsts for his blood, not yours."
13382,"Sylvain: Is that's so, then you oughta stand down. I don't want to fight you either!"
13383,Felix: Fine. Then we're at an impasse.
13384,Ingrid: Felix! Get a grip! We don’t need to fight!
13385,"Felix: Out of my way, Ingrid. I must defeat him."
13386,Ingrid: And then? What will become of you? (sigh) You never have listened to reason!
13387,"Felix: So, the old man's dead?"
13388,Dimitri: Yes.
13389,Felix: I'll cut you down! Prepare yourself you damn boar.
13390,Dimitri: Very well. Come at me Felix.
13391,"Cornelia: My, it's been a long time hasn't it, Your Highness? You've grown awfully strong."
13392,Dimitri: How shameless. I bet it was you who killed my uncle and set me up. Am I right?
13393,Cornelia: Hah! Too true! I'd already forgotten all about that loveliness.
13394,"Dimitri: I'll kill you, you monster! You will pay for all that you have done!"
13395,"Cornelia: Ah, your face brings back memories... Still alive, are we, Gustave?"
13396,"Gilbert: Prattle on, Cornelia. Faerghus will not be cowed by the likes of you."
13397,Cornelia: How very dull...
13398,"Hapi: So it is you. When I heard you were a court mage or whatever, I could hardly believe it. Well, no point in standing around and chatting about old times. Let's get this over with."
13399,"Cornelia: Well, so be it. Still, I'll give you a little gift ..."
13400,"Dimitri: It's over, Cornelia. If you have any last words, now is the time."
13401,"Cornelia: Right you are. Very well ... I have an old tale that I would like you to hear, if I may. About something that happened ten years ago ... Something Patricia said about how she wished to see her real daughter again, no matter who or what she had to sacrifice to do so ... And about how I made her wish come true, at the cost of the king's head ..."
13402,Dimitri: The king's head? You mean Duscur ... You monster! You mean to say that my father ... everyone ... was killed by my stepmother?!
13403,"Cornelia: That's right. Her family meant everything to her... You certainly know that feeling, do you not? Ah, poor little prince. Unloved by the only mother he ever knew... How pitiful."
13404,Dimitri: How dare you!
13405,Cornelia: There's nothing left for you now... Nothing but despair.
13406,Gilbert: ...
13407,"Dimitri: Try as that woman might to spout nonsense to her very last, nothing could change the fact that she was an enemy of the kingdom. She sold out Faerghus to the Empire, forcing our people to suffer their tyranny... But all that ends today. No more blood will be needlessly spilled. Now the Cornelia has fallen, we will exert pressure on the nobles who were aligned with her. Perhaps we may yet find a connection to the tragic incident in Duscur. Once we do that, we will finally be able to prove the innocence of its people."
13408,Dedue: Your highness... I am certain that would make those of Duscur who lost their lives that day very happy. I am grateful. And I am proud to serve a man such as you.
13409,"Gilbert: Come, your highness. You still have some responsibilities that must be carried out. Your people have been patiently awaiting your return."
13410,Dimitri: Do you mean... No. I can't bear to face them after all that I--
13411,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're going.
Choice 2: You must face them."
13412,Choice 1: We're going.
13413,Choice 2: You must face them.
13414,"Dimitri: Professor... Right you are, as ever. I am their king, after all..."
13415,Dimitri: What... what is this?
13416,"Gilbert: As you can see, the people are rejoicing at the return of their king."
13417,"Dimitri: Even though I turned my back on them, and fled the kingdom in disgrace..."
13418,Gilbert: Even so... the spectacle before you does not lie. We are a kingdom in need of a king. A hero to save the people from their long oppression. Your highness... It is truly a blessing that you have returned.
13419,Dimitri: Do I really have the right to stand here? Will they accept me as their king? Bloodstained as I am... Am I fit to be king?
13420,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If you atone, all will be forgiven.
Dimitri: Yes... you are right again, my friend.
Choice 2: Don't cry, Dimitri. This is a happy time.
Dimitri: These are happy tears, my friend."
13421,"Choice 1: If you atone, all will be forgiven.
Dimitri: Yes... you are right again, my friend."
13422,"Dimitri: Yes... you are right again, my friend."
13423,"Choice 2: Don't cry, Dimitri. This is a happy time.
Dimitri: These are happy tears, my friend."
13424,"Dimitri: These are happy tears, my friend."
13425,Dimitri: I am finally home again... Faerghus... How I missed you...
13426,"Dimitri: It may be spring, but the nights are quite chilly here in Fhirdiad... Still, our celebratory feast shows no sign of stopping. Have you grown weary of the festivities?"
13427,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I have.
Dimitri: (chuckles) If memory serves, you were much the same at the ball, all those years ago.
Choice 2: I was going to ask you the same.
Dimitri: It's not that I have grown weary... more that I find it difficult to be around everyone at the moment."
13428,"Choice 1: I have.
Dimitri: (chuckles) If memory serves, you were much the same at the ball, all those years ago."
13429,"Dimitri: (chuckles) If memory serves, you were much the same at the ball, all those years ago."
13430,"Choice 2: I was going to ask you the same.
Dimitri: It's not that I have grown weary... more that I find it difficult to be around everyone at the moment."
13431,Dimitri: It's not that I have grown weary... more that I find it difficult to be around everyone at the moment.
13432,"Dimitri: I have just returned from visiting the graves of my loved ones. It had been a long while since I left flowers. I was always terribly afraid of going near there... But I could not stay away forever. You have taught me something important, professor."
13433,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Studiousness?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable.
Choice 2: Swordsmanship?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable.
Choice 3: Humor?
Dimitri: (chuckles) You never let up, do you? No, what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13434,"Choice 1: Studiousness?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13435,"Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13436,"Choice 2: Swordsmanship?
Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13437,"Dimitri: That too, of course. But what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13438,"Choice 3: Humor?
Dimitri: (chuckles) You never let up, do you? No, what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13439,"Dimitri: (chuckles) You never let up, do you? No, what I am referring to is far more valuable."
13440,"Dimitri: How should I put this... Perhaps it is most accurate to say that...you taught me how to live. If you and I had not reunited on that fateful day, I am certain I would have died a fruitless death on the battlefield. I would have foolishly challenged a horde of foes and, in doing so, needlessly sacrificed the lives of my friends and myself. But now, I have returned to my rightful place. I stuffle with what to say, when I know well that words are not enough to express my gratitude. You save me from the darkness...and guided me back to the light. Thank you, Professor. With all that I am, I thank you."
13441,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you happy?
Dimitri: That...is a hard question to answer. I still do not believe I deserve happiness. These hands of mine have taken so many lives... Nobles and commoners. Adults and children. Perhaps a day will come when I have finally atoned for my sins...but such a day is not possible until after the war is over.
Choice 2: Do you still wish for revenge?
Dimitri: Revenge was never something I wished for... It was an obligation I felt I had inherited from those who died. I believed my life belonged to those who lost their own in Duscur. But what I now seek is something else entirely... I can say that with confidence."
13442,"Choice 1: Are you happy?
Dimitri: That...is a hard question to answer. I still do not believe I deserve happiness. These hands of mine have taken so many lives... Nobles and commoners. Adults and children.

13446,"Dimitri: But I digress... For tonight, our only focus should be to bask in our victory. After that we must prepare for our battle with the Empire. To start, we must absorb the Kingdom knights taken by the Dukedom into our own forces and reshuffle our troops. The lords will need help purge our territory of Imperial forces, and I will use my authority as king to gather forces from various regions... And we'll have to ask the merchants to lend us the fund we require... Oh, and we must request delivery of supplies at once..."
13447,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That sounds like a lot of work.
Dimitri: Heh... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
Choice 2: Good luck with that.
Dimitri: I cannot handle all of this work myself, you know. I will be counting on you, Professor."
13448,"Choice 1: That sounds like a lot of work.
Dimitri: Heh... Just thinking about it makes my head spin."
13449,Dimitri: Heh... Just thinking about it makes my head spin.
13450,"Choice 2: Good luck with that.
Dimitri: I cannot handle all of this work myself, you know. I will be counting on you, Professor."
13451,"Dimitri: I cannot handle all of this work myself, you know. I will be counting on you, Professor."
13452,"Dimitri: There is much to do, but it is all critical work if we hope to stand a chance against the Empire."
13453,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is there no way to coexist with the Empire?
Dimitri: Knowing Edelgard, I doubt there is a path that leads to our coexistence.
Choice 2: You will soon face Edelgard...
Dimitri: Yes... I am well aware."
13454,"Choice 1: Is there no way to coexist with the Empire?
Dimitri: Knowing Edelgard, I doubt there is a path that leads to our coexistence."
13455,"Dimitri: Knowing Edelgard, I doubt there is a path that leads to our coexistence."
13456,"Choice 2: You will soon face Edelgard...
Dimitri: Yes... I am well aware."
13457,Dimitri: Yes... I am well aware.
13458,"Dimitri: I believe we have spoken of this before... Everyone has something they simply cannot accept. As for Edelgard, I am certain she will never be able to accept the Church of Seiros. I believe that is why she seeks to destroy it. She is looking to revolutionize the world. In her mind, for the better. But even if she manages to birth a new world... it would be at the cost of... I wish to end this war through acceptance, not annihilation. Just as my people accepted me, I wish dearly to accept her. But I fear -"
13459,Kingdom Soldier: Your Highness! I finally found you!
13460,"Dimitri: Ah, I am sorry for slipping away. Has something happened?"
13461,Kingdom Soldier: An express messenger just arrived from the leader of the Alliance. Please return to the castle at once.
13462,"Dimitri: An express messengers? What in the world could Claude be after? I am on my way. Professor, please join me."

13466,"The Kingdom Army has reclaimed the kingdom capital and plans to immediately begin restoring the country and its forces. But an unexpected request arrives from Claude, leader of the Leicester Alliance. Dimitri promptly responds to the request for aid, and he rushes to prepare the kingdom's forces.
"
13467,"Having allowed the Imperial army to invade, the Alliance army makes their last stand at the center of House Riegan territory in Derdriu. The Kingdom army rushes to their aid after amassing more troops.

"
13516,"Dimitri: We have received a request for aid from the Alliance. They are being invaded by the Empire. We have only just taken back Fhirdiad, and yet I am already asking all of you to move out once more. Please accept my apologies for that."
13517,"Ingrid: That's no problem at all. More importantly, how is the Alliance faring?"
13518,Dimitri: House Riegan has rallied the Alliance Lords. They are facing the enemy with all the strength they can muster. But we do not know how far that will get them. It seems the enemy's relentless attacks have forced them into a tough situation. Their defeat at Gronder severely weakened the Alliance. I imagine the Empire now intends to destroy them before they can recover.
13519,"Gilbert: To think they'd watch us chase their soldiers out of the kingdom capital, then immediately go invade the Alliance... Their general is Lord Volkhard von Arundel. He serves as regent to the Emperor. He has presumably taken command after the Emperor was wounded in Gronder."
13520,"Dimitri: He is known for his shrewdness and excels not only in domestic affairs, but tactics as well. He is not an opponent we should take lightly. Lord Arundel..."
13521,Byleth: Are you concerned?
13522,"Dimitri: I always suspected that Lord Arundel was behind the tragedy nine years ago. The timing of his departure from the kingdom, the fact that he abruptly stopped making donations... Too many factors made him suspect. If Lord Arundel conspired with Cornelia... then what Kronya and the others said five years ago..."
13523,Gilbert: Hmm...
13524,"Dimitri: Well, nevermind that for now. The Alliance needs our help. What are your thoughts?"
13525,"Gilbert: If we turn our back on the Alliance and then Derdriu falls, it will undoubtedly make our situation difficult further down the road. We would have enemies in two directions... in the Alliance to the northeast and in the Empire to the south."
13526,"Dimitri: That is true. In that scenario, we would not be able to safely march our soldiers to Enbarr."
13527,Flayn: I'm terribly worried about Lady Rhea... but I believe we must save the Alliance first.
13528,"Annette: Oh! Maybe if we do this, the Alliance will help us out in return! We could ask them to help us attack the Empire. You know, a sneak attack or something!"
13529,Mercedes: Annie! When did you become so devious?
13530,Gilbert: Heh. What would your mother think.
13531,Annette: What? It wasn't that devious!
13532,"Gilbert: What do you think, professor?"

Choice 1: Let's march for Derdriu.
Dimitri: Yes, I agree.
Choice 2: I support whatever Dimitri decides.
Dimitri: We must go to Derdriu."
13534,"Choice 1: Let's march for Derdriu.
Dimitri: Yes, I agree."
13535,"Dimitri: Yes, I agree."
13536,"Choice 2: I support whatever Dimitri decides.
Dimitri: We must go to Derdriu."
13537,Dimitri: We must go to Derdriu.
13538,"Dimitri: I will admit that there is something to be gained for us as well, for when we eventually march south... But far more importantly... they need us. We cannot turn our backs on them."
13539,"Dimitri: We will arrange to head out at once. Prepare yourselves, everyone."
13540,Dimitri: it was over 20 years ago... There was an illness raging across Fhirdiad. While people were dying left and right...it was Cornelia who saved the Kingdom from that dreadful illness.
13541,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I can't imagine it...
Dimitri: Neither can I. By the time I was old enough to understand, that time had already passed.
Choice 2: Cornelia was a doctor?
Dimitri: No, I her she was originally an Imperial scholar. She was in the Kingdom by my father's invitation."
13542,"Choice 1: I can't imagine it...
Dimitri: Neither can I. By the time I was old enough to understand, that time had already passed."

13545,"Dimitri: No, I her she was originally an Imperial scholar. She was in the Kingdom by my father's invitation."
13546,"Dimitri: People praised Cornelia as a saint for ending the epidemic. But there came a day when she completely changed. Her behavior, mannerisms, likes, dislikes...everything. Despite all that, Father still appointed her to a high post. After all, she had saved the Kingdom from ruin by that disease... But above all, my stepmother trusted her. That's why what that woman said is... Never mind."
13547,"Dedue: Lord Rodrigue Fraldarius has passed on. Margrave Gautier has assumed his position, and is now gathering the lords of the eastern territories. House Gautier is equal in prestige to House Fraldarius. Sylvain is a Gautier. These lords are reorganizing the Faerghus army, and eradicating any remaining factions that claim allegiance to the Empire. Of course, His Highness is being kept appraised with regular reports. But it falls to me to monitor him, and ensure he does not try to take on too much. I would ask you to do the same. If you take your eyes off that man, even for a moment, he is liable to do something rash."
13548,"My uncle gave me some of my father's belongings. Weapons, books... But there was something else that my old man really wanted to pass down. He wanted me to inherit his mission—ensuring that Dimitri ascends the throne. Or so I believe."
13549,"Ashe: The very same night we liberated the capital, a messenger arrived from Derdriu. Claude must have predicted that we'd retake it."
13550,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Definitely. (Relationship with Ashe up) (No extra dialogue)
Choice 2: Could have been a coincidence.
Ashe: No, I don't think so. It takes too long to travel to Fhirdiad from Derdriu for it to be chance."

13554,"Ashe: Claude's a hard person to read. It's obvious not much escapes his eye though. Kind of unsettling, honestly."
13555,"Sylvain: Derdriu, the Aquatic Capital... I've heard it's a magnificent city, you know. If we're going, I wish it wasn't to wage war. It'd be more fun to visit with a cute girl on my arm."
13556,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Maybe once the war is over... (Relationship with Sylvain up)
(If Male Byleth)  Sylvain: You're right. That's something to look forward to.
(If Female Byleth) Sylvain: Yeah? Maybe you and me? That'd be a good reason to survive the war. Heh heh...

13561,"Sylvain: Aw, come on. let a guy dream."
13562,"Mercedes: I went to visit my adoptive father at his home in the capital. He used to grovel at Cornelia's feet when the city was under her control. But after it was liberated, he started courting the Kingdom instead."
13563,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Whatever it takes to get ahead.
Mercedes: I suppose he was just doing what he needed to survive...
Choice 2: That's despicable. (Relationship with Mercedes up)
Mercedes: Absolutely. He's hopeless. I suppose when you're a merchant, that's all you know."

13568,"Mercedes: No matter what becomes of the world, it'll always be plagued by people like him."
13569,"Annette: Derdriu, huh? I've always wanted to go there. In Faerghus, most of the towns are pretty much glorified fortresses. So to hear about a place called the Aquatic capital... it just sounds so elegant! When the war's over, I hope I can visit with everyone there!"
13570,"Ingrid: So, House Riegan has regained its influence in the Alliance and is gathering forces. Claude always was somewhat inscrutable. It's strange somehow to hear talk of his brilliance as the leader of the Alliance."
13571,"Ferdinand: I have been wondering something... If I had not been your student, where would I be right now? Who would I be? Do you ever think about that sort of thing, Professor?"
13572,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Like what if I had led a different class?
Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to back and try a different path.

Ferdinand: Ah, so you do think about such questions. You can never find answers though, right? We cannot turn back time, so there is no way to back and try a different path.

13579,"Linhardt: Traveling to the Empire, to the Kingdom, and then off to Alliance territory... Everyone certainly is busy. Perhaps it's not a bad thing now that I think about it."
13580,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's all in the pursuit of peace.
Linhardt: Peace will be lovely. Peace will, one assumes, be considerably less perilous.
Choice 2: Yes, very busy. (Relationship with Linhardt up)

13585,"Caspar: Didn't they used to call Claude the ""Master Tactician""? I want a nickname too! Maybe I'll get one if I can rescue him at Derdriu... I'll come up with a plan that's even better than his and earn a nickname for sure!"
13586,"Bernadetta: Claude... Claude... Which one was he again? Oh! Right. Yeah, of course I remember him. It's just... I can't picture his face. Don't remember what he looks like. I'm not sure if I ever knew."
13587,Dorothea: Dimitri is going to Claude's aid. How great is that? It's like we've gone back to how things were five years ago. It's so nice. Just imagine if Edie was there too? I suppose you can't ever really go back to the way things were in the past...
13588,"Petra: I am being told you can see the sea from Derdriu. Not just see...that it is right there in front of you. In Brigid, the sea has great closeness. I would be looking at it every day. But in Garreg Mach, we cannot look at the sea. So I am feeling...drawn to Derdriu."
13589,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The ocean is frightening. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: That is true. The ghosts of the sea have vengeance in their hearts. If they are wanting to take you, you cannot be saved.
Choice 2: The sea is beautiful.
Petra: Yes, I think the sea has much beauty. But can also be frightening."

13593,"Petra: Yes, I think the sea has much beauty. But can also be frightening."
13594,"Lorenz: It seems Dimitri has become downright charitable. But I believe he is operating under a serious misapprehension. It may appear as if Claude is appealing to Dimitri for aid, but that is not what is happening here."
13595,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Another one of Claude's tricks?
Lorenz: That's not it either. I see it got by you as well.
Choice 2: Did he not actually ask for help?
Lorenz: That's not it either. I see it got by you as well.
Choice 3: Is there another interpretation? (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: Yes. A fine example of how snap decisions based on mere appearances can lead to gross misunderstandings."

13601,Lorenz: Yes. A fine example of how snap decisions based on mere appearances can lead to gross misunderstandings.
13602,"Lorenz: Claude has asked for reinforcements from here because he knows I am here. Simply put, he is not throwing himself on Dimitri's mercy. He is throwing himself on mine. I suppose there is nothing else for it, is there? We cannot turn our backs on those in need. Let us grant him the aid he requires."
13603,"Raphael: We're going to go help Claude? I haven't seen him in forever. Wonder how he's been... I chose this side because I believe in you, Professor. But it's not like I got anything against Claude."
13604,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What was he like?
Raphael: Hmm... Well, he loved parties, and he was full of some pretty good jokes!
Choice 2: Were you close? (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Of course! Claude was the kinda person who would be instantly friends with anyone."

13609,"Raphael: I got no clue what'll happen to the Alliance, but I sure hope Claude doesn't die..."
13610,"Ignatz: So, war finally comes to the Alliance territories. I don't mean that there's never been fighting on Alliance soil, of course. There have been countless skirmishes between neighboring lords, as well as conflicts with Almyra. But this is an invasion by an army of the Empire. It's a whole different animal. I don't want to see my family get dragged into this... I hope we can drive back the Empire."
13611,Lysithea: The pro-Imperialist lords who've let the Empire in have their hands tied. Houses Ordelia and Gloucester are exposed and likely caught off guard. That must mean that Claude's allies are...
13612,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Duke Goneril.
Lysithea: Geographically, it would be hard for him to commit his forces, and logically, it wouldn't make sense for him to offer support.
Choice 2: Margrave Edmund.
Lysithea: Margrave Edmund does not commit troops as easily as he commits funds, so that's doubtful.
Choice 3: Count Daphnel. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: Without a doubt she is providing reinforcements. She has always supported Claude."
13613,"Choice 1: Duke Goneril.

Lysithea: Without a doubt she is providing reinforcements. She has always supported Claude."
13618,Lysithea: Without a doubt she is providing reinforcements. She has always supported Claude.
13619,"Lysithea: Whatever the situation, Claude's military strength is lacking, and what's more, they suffered casualties at Gronder Field. I don't know how long the Alliance forces will be able to hold out against the Empire. We've got to move quickly or we may be too late."
13620,"Marianne: I'm glad Dimitri and Claude don't have to fight one another... I am the daughter of an Alliance lord though, so I suppose that goes without saying. Having to fight with your former classmates is just so terribly sad..."
13621,"Hilda: We took Fhirdiad back, but I never found the time to go shopping there! When the war's over and the city is revitalized, I'd like to visit again. Will you come with me, Professor?"
13622,"Byleth:
Choice 1: All right. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Really? Oh, I'm so glad! Although I suppose we have bigger things on our plate, like...

13626,"Hilda: Claude! He's in big trouble. I bet my family is too. We have to help them, Professor! I know we can't lose with you on our side!"
13627,"Leonie: Guess this doesn't end with liberating the Kingdom capital. Derdriu is next. That prince really works his people hard, doesn't he? Or should I be calling him a king now? Whatever the title is, he'll always be Dimitri to me."
13628,"Seteth: I thought there was a chance that Cornelia had captured Lady Rhea, but it seems that is not the case. Our next foe, Lord Arundel, was once a pious adherent to the Seiros creed. His contributions to the church stopped quite abruptly some time ago. I think it is likely the man knows something."
13629,"Flayn: You plan to aid Claude, do you not? I think that is absolutely marvelous. Being opposing forces at the battle of Gronder was ill fated. It hurts to side against him. I am happy that things have taken a brighter turn now."
13630,"Hanneman: Cornelia Arnim... That's a familiar name, yes. She once studied in the Empire. My understanding is, shortly after I left the Empire, she did as well. Unlike myself, Cornelia traveled to the Kingdom. Apparently she halted a plague, and was rewarded with a quite powerful appointment. That such a an outstanding researcher should fall to such depravity... Sickening, Professor. And quite sad."
13631,"Manuela: Remember the Death Knight who stabbed me five years ago? Of course you do. How could you forget? Well, it turns out he's a general in the Imperial army, claiming victory on dozens of battlefields. But it looks like he's not at Derdriu. Like every man in my life, he's run away from me... And he better run! One day, I'm gonna find that guy and pay him back for what he did to me!"
13632,"Gilbert: With the capital recaptured. I desire to call him ""Your Majesty"" rather than ""Your Highness."" He would refuse my desire, rightfully pointing out that he has not, as yet, been crowned. However, the day this war has ended, and the church has placed the crown upon his head... Then, he will truly be our king, and I will call him ""Your Majesty"" at last. I must go hear the reports from our spies. There is something worrying me and—No. I can wait. I shall tell you more when our information is more concrete."
13633,"Alois: I was getting excited for our big Empire showdown! I spent so much time mentally preparing. Then we shifted focus to Derdriu. I hadn't been expecting that. But, as a knight who's sworn to serve the goddess, I cannot turn a blind ear to those who seek my aid."
13634,"Catherine: We're still searching for Lady Rhea. No news on that, I'm afraid. Lord Arundel, the emperor's uncle, is the regent of the Empire. If we crush them at Derdriu, maybe we'll capture him and wring some clues out of him."
13635,"Shamir: Claude, eh? He always was sharp among his peers. Never let himself get caught up in conventions. He wasn't typical in Fódlan. I'd like to save him if we can."
13636,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll make it in time.
Shamir: I know. And I'm sure he's already calculated exactly when that will be.
Choice 2: He's too determined to die. (Relationship with Shamir up)

Shamir: Heh. You may be right."
13640,Shamir: Heh. You may be right.
13641,"Cyril: Ugh, even if we do enter Alliance territory, we're not gonna find Lady Rhea there. I wish we could leave Claude be and go attack the Empire. I suppose if we can't beat the Empire forces here, then we can't get into the Empire lands, can we? I guess that means it's just hard work time, huh, Professor?"
13642,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Derdriu is known as the Aquatic capital... It's a beautiful town with streets that seem to float on the water and an impressive harbor. In times of peace, it would be a wonderful place for a holiday... Anyway! Best of luck in the next battle!"
13643,"Citizen: A hungry hero is no better than a well-fed soldier. Do you know that saying? No? That's because I just made it up. If you're hungry, you're never going to be at full strength. Keep your belly full and stay strong!"
13644,"Merchant: I heard that Derdriu is under attack. I hope Judith is all right... She may be the Hero of Daphnel, but facing the might of the Empire? I wish there was something more I could do. But I can only pray and hope."
13645,"Soldier: If you travel east from the Alliance and cross Fódlan's Throat, you enter the land of Almyra. House Goneril's territory touches the eastern border of the Alliance. They also have Lord Holst, the most valiant warrior in the Alliance. Tasked with keeping watch over the Almyrans' movements, he rarely leaves the Goneril territory."
13646,"Knight of Seiros: The Alliance leader is too demanding, and the prince is too soft-hearted. Don't you think? The spilled much of each other's blood at Gronder. I lost a lot of friends to the Alliance... Sorry... I shouldn't complain. I know this is tactically sound. Everyone seems on board with it, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have any misgivings."
13647,"Merchant: It'll take a little while yet for the capital to be restored to its former glory. But it's not dead yet. Doesn't matter how many time you put the people of Fhirdiad down, they'll get right back up again. Just you watch. Before long, things will be back to how they were."
13648,"Artisan: We can't actually join you on the battlefield, but rest assured that we're there in spirit. We're doing everything we can to support the army, so give it your all out there!"
13649,"Knight of Seiros: Using the Great Bridge of Myrddin as a base, we'll spread out and cover as much ground as possible in our search for Her Grace. Judging by the information we've gathered, the most suspicious location is definitely the Imperial capital. The Hyrm territory, whose leader is a mere puppet, and the Aegir territory, whose leader was deposed and disappeared... The Empire has a lot of places with suspicious happenings. It's certainly worth investigating. But it won't do to take too much time in relieving the Alliance army. Please, hurry."
13650,Yuri: So the king who came back from hell defeated the tyrant and liberated the people. It's like something out of a poetic saga. At least those in need will see it as such.
13651,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You think so?
Choice 2: How do you see it? (Relationship with Yuri up)"
13652,Choice 1: You think so?
13653,Choice 2: How do you see it? (Relationship with Yuri up)
13654,"Yuri: It isn't like the poor need some lofty heir basking in glory. What they need is someone who can ease their woes, keep them fed. Things like that. How they view such a king all depends on his ability to provide for them. All things considered, I imagine Dimitri will do a fine job at it."
13655,"Balthus: It's happened. The Alliance is now little more than a battlefield. I guess that was inevitable... So far, Albrecht territory has remained unscathed. But that won't last forever."
13656,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll win this for the Alliance as well. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: When I see that Arundel guy, I'm gonna knock him flat.
Choice 2: There's no time to waste.
Balthus: I appreciate the sentiment, pal, but we can't just rush into this thing. Let's make sure we're ready, yeah?"
13657,"Choice 1: We'll win this for the Alliance as well. (Relationship with Balthus up)

13661,"Balthus: We're short on time, but we have to go in prepared. If we lose this, we lose everything. The stakes are too damn high."
13662,Constance: I was most relieved to hear that no one at the school of sorcery was harmed. They are capable people who bear Fódlan's future on their shoulders. We can afford to lose none of them.
13663,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's good that Fhirdiad is ours once again. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: Yes, the future of magic is bright! Though it would be brighter if my own house's future was guaranteed.

Constance: In exchange for securing a bright future for magic in Fódlan, that is a small price to pay."

13668,"Constance: The Alliance is next on our agenda, yes? Ahaha! Watch carefully for my dazzling spellcraft!"
13669,"Hapi: People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and nobles clashing over territory. Things like that. So before the war, when folks talked about how peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent are you living on?"" I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there are nothing compared to a full-blown war. The one truly peaceful place I've known was the village where I grew up."
13670,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear Derdriu is our next objective. Small world. That's actually where I grew up. It's a great place."
13671,"Resident: The army runs you ragged. Marches you from place to place, prodding you to fight. They promised me three meals a day... They'd have to give a lot more than that to get me to sign on. I'd rather starve down here than deal with that."
13672,"Alliance Soldier 1: The citizens of Derdriu have all been evacuated and are now at sea! Are you sure about this? If Derdriu were to fall, those ships don't have enough resources for --"
13673,"Claude: Derdriu won't fall. Have some faith in me, will you?"
13674,"Alliance Soldier 1: Oh! Yes, sir!"
13675,Alliance Soldier 2: Our line of defense has been broken! The Imperial army will be here any moment!
13676,Claude: Understood. You two join up with the troops in the city.
13677,"Alliance Soldier 2: Yes, sir! (both Alliance soldiers bow and run off)"
13678,"Claude: Judith, are you ready?"
13679,Judith: As ready as I'll ever be. It's been years since I last battled in the city streets.
13680,Claude: Don't go messing up because your vision has weakened with age. Take the defensive for now.
13681,"Judith: Yeah, yeah, I get it. You hang in there, too, boy. Your wounds from Gronder Field haven't fully healed yet, have they?"
13682,"Claude: No, but it's not like I can sit this one out. I have to make my daring escape, after all. And for the last time, stop calling me ""boy""! That's an official order from the leader of the Alliance."
13683,"Judith: Understood, Leader Man. I wonder if our little ray of hope will show up... We fought on opposite sides at Gronder, didn't we?"
13684,"Claude: They'll come. You can count on it. If anyone can bring him back, it's Teach. Teach will talk, and he'll listen. But more than anything, I've their skill and abilities... I believe in them."
13685,Alliance Soldier 3: Claude! Reinforcements are coming from the west! Their banner is that of the Kingdom...
13686,Claude: What did I tell you? They're here. And just in time.
13687,"Gilbert: It appears the Imperial army has already marched into Derdriu and engaged the Alliance. It seems the Imperial advance has been stalled by guerrilla skirmishes. The Alliance forces are holding out, but they won't last much longer..."
13688,"Ingrid: That must be Judith of House Daphnel who joined up with Claude's troops. To think Judith, a true hero, would find herself backed into a corner like this..."
13689,Dimitri: It is not so. The Alliance has only drawn the enemy so deeply into the city to allow us to attack them from behind. Brilliant.
13690,Byleth: They're planning a pincer attack?
13691,"Dimitri: I believe so. He put his soldiers into position purely on the belief that we'd come... I can't believe Claude would risk everything on that behalf. He has placed all of his hopes on us. Let's make sure we live up to his expectations, Professor."
13692,Dimitri: Here we go. Let's move!
13693,Suggested Level: 37
13694,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
13695,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle, or Claude falls in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth, Dimitri, or Claude falls in battle."
13696,"(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle, or Claude falls in battle."
13697,"(Classic Mode) Byleth, Dimitri, or Claude falls in battle."
13698,"Lord Arundel: The leader of the Alliance has managed to escape to the harbor, has he? Those rats resist in vain..."
13699,Imperial Soldier: Your Excellency! There's an army closing in on us from outside. The banners...are those of House Blaiddyd.
13700,"Lord Arundel: Blaiddyd? I see... That idiot failed, it seems. Hurry up and kill the leader of the Alliance. With him gone, Derdriu will fall."
13701,Dimitri: I will not let Claude die... Let's hurry to his rescue.
13702,"Claude: Hey, you're late! Hurry up and help!"
13703,Gilbert: Look. The Imperial army's supply corps. Attacking them now would be a fine plan.
13704,Imperial Soldier: The subjugation of Derdriu is complete. We will be joining the main army now!
13705,Claude: Ugh... They're showing up one after another... Nothing for it but to blockade the gate leading to the town. I don't want the enemy's numbers to increase any more.
13706,"Hilda: Claude's nuts. Asking me to protect the bridge! That's so much responsibility. But the guy's so helpless, I feel sorry for him. So, I'll do what I can to protect him."
13707,"Hilda: Professor! It's been too long. I was hoping you'd show up. Seeing you puts a spring in my step! Come on, time to 'em the Hilda treatment! (support points gained)"
13708,"Hilda: It's been fun, Claude... Sorry to go so soon..."
13709,Claude: Hilda! Why didn't you retreat?! I counted on you retreating...
13710,"Judith: It's no good...we're surrounded. But I need to hurry up and rescue the boy... To get to the harbor, first we have to get rid of the enemy mercenaries. There's no other way."
13711,Judith: Thank you. That was a big help. I'll go and cover our leader!
13712,"Judith: I guess my vision really is going! I slipped up... Don't you get yourself killed out there, boy."
13713,"Claude: Judith! Stop calling me ""boy""! I'm your leader... And I told you not to die..."
13714,"Imperial Soldier: Now! Hidden soldiers, attack!"
13715,Claude: I missed that face! And you're just in time. Thanks for that. (support points gained if unit can support Claude)
13716,"Dimitri: You're OK... Can you still fight, Claude?"
13717,"Claude: You barely snatch me from the jaws of death, and now you're recruiting me! You sure know how to inspire loyalty, Your Majesty. Sadly, I'm not free to move here, for many reasons. You'll have to repel the Empire without me..."
13718,"Claude: Professor, if you had chosen me instead of Dimitri... No. I shouldn't dwell on it. I'm grateful you came. I'm glad to have your strength, if only for today. (support points gained)"
13719,"Claude: My plan failed... Teach. Dimitri. That's enough. Time to retreat. I've crossed one too many bridges... It's a shame, but... It's over now..."
13720,Lord Arundel: Clever. I can't believe they pushed through to here. Nothing is more foolish than dying in vain. Let's get to the harbor and finish off the leader of the Alliance! (begins to move towards Claude)
13721,"Lord Arundel: Nothing bites so hard as a cornered rat, eh?"
13722,"Lord Arundel: You would raise a weapon against your uncle? You've grown into a savage of a man, just like your father."
13723,"Dimitri: You are rather calm for one in your position. Or did you forget that this is a battlefield? Perhaps this is no time for words, Uncle. There will be time for that after we have settled things here."
13724,"Your very presence has foiled our plans, yet again..."
13725,Do our hopes end here...
13726,"Dimitri: Uncle, I need to know. The incident nine years ago ... You were involved, weren't you? You know something. What did Cornelia... No. What did my stepmother do?!"
13727,"Arundel: You are not qualified to look into the darkness... You and Edelgard... Do your best to kill each other... You are family, after all. There it is... the light..."
13728,"Dimitri: He's dead. There goes our chance to gain more information. Then again, even if we had managed to capture him alive, judging by the way he was acting..."
13729,"Byleth:
Choice 1: For now, let's rejoice in our victory.
Choice 2: We can think about that later."
13730,"Choice 1: For now, let's rejoice in our victory."
13731,Choice 2: We can think about that later.
13732,Claude: Teach is absolutely right. We should take this rare opportunity to let off some tension.
13733,"Dimitri: It's been a long time, Claude. I am glad to see that you're safe."
13734,"Claude: Same. I haven't seen you since the nightmare that was Gronder. You really did come to help us... You must be a bunch of soft-hearted suckers, eh?"
13735,"Dimitri: If you really felt that way, you would not have set up a defensive battle in the hopes that we would come. It worked out, only because we made it in time... Were you really so confident that we would answer the call?"
13736,Claude: Of course. I knew you wouldn't hesitate to put yourself second and come running to our aid.
13737,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You know him well.
Choice 2: How insightful."
13738,Choice 1: You know him well.
13739,Choice 2: How insightful.
13740,"Claude: You and I are cut from different cloth. I wouldn't make a move unless I could gain something from it. You've always been just the opposite. And of course, I've always been fond of taking dangerous risks. After all, I sent that express messenger before you had even recaptured the kingdom capital. If all went to plan, I knew you'd recapture it soon, and then respond to our request for aid. It was riskier than usual, I'll give you that. But it was the only card I had to play, so I took the gamble."
13741,Dimitri: You cross too many dangerous bridges for my liking.
13742,"Claude: I know, I know. But... that ends today."
13743,Dimitri: What do you mean?
13744,"Claude: Here, take this. Use it however you see fit."
13745,"Dimitri: The legendary bow, Failnaught... Isn't this the hero's relic of house Riegan? Hold, Claude. This must be one of your jokes. You cannot truly intend to part with this..."
13746,"Claude: It's not a joke. As of today, the Leicester alliance is no more."
13747,"Dimitri: Just what are you planning, Claude?"
13748,"Claude: If you're going to lead Fódlan, then the alliance Lords will follow you. Back in the day, the Alliance split off from the kingdom. I'm just putting us back together again. Oh, and I've already gained the support of the other Lords at the roundtable conference, so you can stop looking at me like I'm crazy. All that's left for me is to officially step down as the leader of the Alliance."
13749,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What will you do now? (No additional dialogue)
Choice 2: Will you join our army?
Claude: Hold your horses there, Teach."
13750,Choice 1: What will you do now? (No additional dialogue)
13751,"Choice 2: Will you join our army?
Claude: Hold your horses there, Teach."
13752,"Claude: Hold your horses there, Teach."
13753,"Claude: I'm leaving Fódlan. There are things I have to do. Dreams I need to see to fruition. That's why I became the Alliance leader to begin with, actually. But it left me no time for what I was really after. You'd better not take on too many responsibilities yourselves, or else you'll end up in the same boat. And remember... both the living and the dead cling to us without any regard for our own lives. It's up to us to break free of that weight and follow the path that we believe in."
13754,Dimitri: Claude...
13755,"Claude: Oops! I almost forgot the most important thing. If you're looking for Rhea, apparently she's being held captive in the imperial capital. It doesn't sound like they intend to kill her, but there's no telling what they're planning."
13756,"Dimitri: You have my gratitude, Claude."
13757,"Claude: Gratitude? Thanks but no thanks. As far as I'm concerned, we're even now. I don't know how many years will pass until then, but let's promise to meet again. And when we do... don't be too hard on me, your Kingliness."
13758,"Felix: Well, Dimitri? Are you finally going to tell us the damned truth?"
13759,Dimitri: What are you talking about?
13760,Ashe: Didn't Lord Arundel say something about you and Edelgard being family?
13761,Ingrid: To claim that the king and the emperor are related... Could it be?
13762,"Dimitri: Ah, I suppose I never told you, though I do recall mentioning it briefly to the professor... Lord Arundel spoke the truth. My stepmother was Edelgard's birth mother. Political turmoil drove my stepmother out of the Empire. Father fell in love with her at first sight and they married. I lost my birth mother before I was old enough to remember her. My stepmother filled that role for me. But she lost her life in Duscur nine years ago, along with Father."
13763,"Felix: Hang on, I didn't even know she was your stepmother. Did my father know about this?"
13764,"Dimitri: Yes. All those who were close to my father knew, including Rodrigue. But to speak openly about it would have caused a scandal, and so she was out secret. No one in the general public knew about her. Naturally, the fact that Edelgard and I are stepsiblings was kept a secret as well."
13765,"Mercedes: I'm finally beginning to understand what you went through five years ago. I mean, Edelgard is the only family you have left, isn't she? To find out someone so precious to you is actually your most hated enemy... How heartbreaking."
13766,"Annette: But wait! You two were born and raised in two different territories, right? So you probably never met until you were both at the academy. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the idea of fighting family is just about the worst thing ever. But hopefully the fact that she's a stepsister you never really knew helps with the pain... I don't know, it was just a thought."
13767,"Dimitri: I am afraid that's not the case. Though it was only for a short time, Edelgard once called Fhirdiad home. It was a long time ago, but she was a cherished friend of mine."
13768,"Sylvain: Wait! I remember now! She was that girl, wasn't she? The one you gave a dagger to! Heh, so your little girlfriend was Edelgard."
13769,"Dimitri: Sylvain. If you have any more foolish things to say, please hold them for later."
13770,"Sylvain: I do have a few more up my sleeve, but they can wait. Go on, Your Highness. This is important for us to hear."
13771,"Felix: She may be a hated enemy now, but the emperor is your old friend and stepsister. Can you bring yourself to kill her?"
13772,"Dimitri: I will kill her... if I must. But if there is any chance that the world she seeks to create could be a just one... Then I... I would love to see a future in which I may reach out my hand for her and have her reach back. That said, I have no intention of letting my personal feelings cloud my judgment. Too much is at stake."
13773,"Ashe: Your Highness... I think you should meet with the emperor and at least try to talk to her. If there's any hope of ending this war without more bloodshed, we have to try. Besides, killing your own family... I'm sorry, but it's not right."
13774,Dimitri: I...I think so too. And you are right that we should at least try.
13775,Edelgard: I see. So my uncle's defeat is beyond doubt?
13776,"Hubert: Yes, Your Majesty. I have confirmed it via countless channels. I advise that we accept this as a drop of joy amid a pool of sorrow."
13777,"Edelgard: Pretty words, but I'm afraid we can't rest until the joy outweighs the sorrow. And for that to happen, it now seems we must confront them all at once. Dimitri, who took back Fhirdiad... Claude, who managed to protect the Alliance...And that professor, who is successfully mobilizing the Knights of Seiros..."
13778,"Hubert: What will you do, Your Majesty?"
13779,"Edelgard: Pull back our forces. In the west, to Arianrhod. In the east, to—"
13780,"Hubert: Fort Merceus, I presume? There is no better place for such a confrontation after all."
13781,"Edelgard: Indeed. And dispatch the Death Knight to guard it. He can buy us some time. In the meantime, I will—"
13782,"Hubert: Forgive me, but I must speak bluntly. I do not agree with what you intend to do. Though slight, there is a chance that once done, it cannot be undone."
13783,"Edelgard: Even I cannot choose the direction my path leads me. There is no other way. And so, I must walk on."

13787,"When Claude steps down as its leader, the Leicester Alliance disbands and its lords swear fealty to the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. The chaos in the Kingdom begins to dissipate as the people unite under Dimitri's rule. Riding this momentum, the Kingdom army prepares to march south for a decisive battle against Imperial forces.
"
13788,"Are you prepared?
"
13789,"Only the Empire remains.
"
13790,"Let's proceed with caution.
"
13791,"I wonder where he will go.
"
13792,"Laying a siege to a keep is like...

13793,"Death Knight...
"

13839,Dimitri: We will finally have our decisive battle with the Empire this month.
13840,"Gilbert: The eastern lords are in the process of consolidating all of the troops within the entire Kingdom.
(If Paralogue: The Silver Maiden has not yet been completed) There are still some lords who side with the Empire, but I believe it is only a matter of time before they surrender.
(If Paralogue: The Silver Maiden has been completed) In addition, ever since Arianrhod's liberation, the western lords have been declaring their fealty one after another."

13843,"Ashe: Affairs within the Kingdom have calmed down considerably, and we even managed to win over the Alliance."
13844,"Annette: Although it was a rough go at first, I'm starting to feel like we could actually win this!"
13845,"Mercedes: That's true! Thinking back on it now, we've really come a long way."
13846,"Seteth: We even have a lead to where Rhea is located. It is as we predicted all along. If we are to rescue Rhea, then we must defeat the emperor..."
13847,"Ashe: Um, if we're going to march from the monastery to Enbarr, then we'll have to cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin again, right?"
13848,"Dimitri: Yes, I believe so. As we have gained the Alliance's support, we should not have any trouble this time. After the bridge, we can head across Gronder Field and head south. And then we'll take Merceus, the so-called impregnable fortress that towers on the other side."
13849,Byleth: An impregnable fortress?
13850,Ashe: Fort Merceus... I know of it. They say it rivals even Arianrhod.
13851,Gilbert: (If Ashe is not present) Fort Merceus is praised as the strongest defense in the Empire. (Continues below)
13852,"Gilbert: Count Bergliez, the Empire's minister of military affairs, once had troops stationed there. But according to our spies, a large scale force has entered the stronghold. Perhaps they are gathering soldiers from various regions to compensate for their losses."
13853,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Should we try to avoid it?
Dimitri: If we try to avoid it, those troops will follow us and attack from the rear. It is best for us to handle the situation head-on.
Choice 2: Can we really prevail?
Dimitri: It is unlike you to worry so. But I feel we have no choice but to strip that place of its ""impregnable"" reputation."
13854,"Choice 1: Should we try to avoid it?
Dimitri: If we try to avoid it, those troops will follow us and attack from the rear. It is best for us to handle the situation head-on."

13857,"Dimitri: It is unlike you to worry so. But I feel we have no choice but to strip that place of its ""impregnable"" reputation."
13858,"Dimitri: Once we take Fort Merceus, Enbarr will be within reach. This is the Empire's last chance to stop us from arriving at our goal."
13859,"Sylvain: In other words, if we take this fort, then our blades will at the emperor's throat in no time."
13860,"Ashe: If this is the last fort between us and them, then the emperor will likely do everything she can to strengthen its defenses."
13861,Dimitri: I just received a report on that very subject. The one commanding the troops stationed at Fort Merceus is someone we have crossed blades with many times. It is the Death Knight who awaits us there.
13862,"Mercedes:
(If Paralogue: The Face Beneath has been completed) Oh... So that's who we'll be battling... Emile..."
13863,(If Paralogue: The Face Beneath has been completed) Oh... So that's who we'll be battling... Emile...
13864,"Dimitri: From this point onward, we're in all-out war with the Empire. Are you prepared, Professor?"
13865,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am.
Dimitri: I am glad to hear it. That means we can approach the coming battles with peace of mind.
Choice 2: Are you?
Dimitri: I have already steeled myself as best I can."
13866,"Choice 1: I am.
Dimitri: I am glad to hear it. That means we can approach the coming battles with peace of mind."
13867,Dimitri: I am glad to hear it. That means we can approach the coming battles with peace of mind.
13868,"Choice 2: Are you?
Dimitri: I have already steeled myself as best I can."
13869,Dimitri: I have already steeled myself as best I can.
13870,"Dimitri: First we capture Fort Merceus. The fighting will be undoubtedly be brutal, but... we must prevail. As far as this army and I are concerned, you're our last ray of hope. We are relying on you."
13871,"Dedue: Claude has stepped down from leadership, and Leicester is now a vassal state of Faerghus. The lords of the western Kingdom are beginning to declare fealty to us in greater numbers also. The Empire is our only remaining enemy."
13872,"Felix: We defeated Lord Arundel. The emperor must have been surprised. If we can keep up that fervor, perhaps we'll capture Fort Merceus, and move on to the Imperial capital. We must not be overconfident though."
13873,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're going to win
Felix: You're optimistic.
Choice 2: Let's proceed with caution. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: Yes, I concur."
13874,"Choice 1: We're going to win
Felix: You're optimistic."
13875,Felix: You're optimistic.

13877,"Felix: Yes, I concur."
13878,"Felix: Human and beasts are ultimately the same. When they're cornered, they lash out however they can. They fight for their lives. Who knows how the emperor will lash out? We have to be careful."
13879,"Ashe: I wonder where Claude will go. From the sound of it, he's leaving Fódlan altogether. He was strangely gallant about the whole thing. Even left his Relic behind. Elusive and mysterious to the end, isn't he?"
13880,"Sylvain: Ya know Professor, laying a siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move."
13881,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean. I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...
Choice 2: You might be right. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: See? You get it. Our fearless leader on the other hand... He's never been good with the ladies."

13886,"Sylvain: Anyway, I figure you go after the main gate. You take that out and I'm sure we can win. Of course, you're making the tactical calls. I'm happier to follow than to lead."

13888,"Byleth:

13892,Mercedes: You're right. I'll have to face him eventually.
13893,"Annette: Oh, Professor! Good timing. You have to talk some sense into my father! Recently he's been doing nothing but work himself to the bone. Even when he's taking breaks from training and errands, he's apparently listening to reports. Day in and day out. He's getting on in years, you know? I just want him to take care of himself..."
13894,"Ingrid: Just as we suspected, Lady Rhea was taken to the Imperial capital. We must get to the capital as quickly as possible. So many people are worried sick about her... I do wonder when Claude managed to learn Lady Rhea's whereabouts. He's pretty shrewd. I can't help but admire him."
13895,"Ferdinand: The majority is with us. This conflict will end soon. I am so moved by the decision that Claude and the Alliance nobles have made. That is true nobility! Acting in accordance with the people's needs and wishes. As war drags on, those living near the front lines inevitably get the worse of it. Still...Edelgard will not give in. She will push to complete her mission, no matter how many people die. Not everyone with noble blood has noble ideals."
13896,"Linhardt: Attacking an impregnable fortress head-on is rather impressive... or suicidal. Depends on the day really. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? It may be stubborn, but its age means it's got to be hiding a few weak spots. Makes sense to aim for those areas."
13897,"Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when the fortress was just a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days."
13898,"Bernadetta: I love a good fortress - the perfect place to hide! This one's impregnable too, isn't it? Perfect! As soon as we take it, I'll set up a special spot for Bernie!"
13899,"Byleth:
Choice 1: If we can take it, it's not impregnable.
Bernadetta: I guess you have a point. What would you call it, then? A little pregnable?
Choice 2: It's too big to make a good hiding place. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: Now that you mention it, I guess it is pretty huge.,,"
13900,"Choice 1: If we can take it, it's not impregnable.
Bernadetta: I guess you have a point. What would you call it, then? A little pregnable?"
13901,"Bernadetta: I guess you have a point. What would you call it, then? A little pregnable?"
13902,"Choice 2: It's too big to make a good hiding place. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: Now that you mention it, I guess it is pretty huge.,,"
13903,"Bernadetta: Now that you mention it, I guess it is pretty huge.,,"
13904,"Dorothea: The Leicester Alliance is no more. Three hundred years of history...gone and done. They write operas about events like this, you know."
13905,"Dorothea: I'm sure they'll have a talented and beautiful songstress playing you. And with Dimitri at your side... Well, they'll probably contrive some kind of romance to keep things interesting."
13906,Dorothea: Dimitri will be played by the most handsome actor of the time. Hearts will pound as he takes the stage. What am I saying? Surely the most handsome man would play you.
13907,"Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising. I thought we could be using attacks like that at this fortress. But I am hearing a different thing. A brute force attack with all of our power, yes? Attacks that are surprising are also safer. Attacking from the front has... is dangerous. But I will give you all of my fighting spirit, Professor."
13908,Lorenz: It appears that Claude has dissolved the Alliance. He's thrown away the pride of all the Leicester lords who have walked the path of independence from Faerghus for generations! I said from the start that he was not suitable to lead!
13909,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Uh-huh... (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Choice 2: But even you..."
13910,Choice 1: Uh-huh... (Relationship with Lorenz up)
13911,Choice 2: But even you...
13912,Lorenz: ... (surprised look and gasp)
13913,"Lorenz: Well, times have changed, haven't they? I suppose we can trust the Kingdom now."
13914,"Raphael: Wake up, eat, train, eat, train, eat, sleep. We gotta prepare for the assault, but that hasn't changed my routine!"
13915,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're doing plenty. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Choice 2: Can't you do more?"
13916,Choice 1: You're doing plenty. (Relationship with Raphael up)
13917,Choice 2: Can't you do more?
13918,Raphael: All the training...and eating...I do is for the sake of Fódlan! Gotta stay strong...and fed...to keep it safe!
13919,"Ignatz: My family made it through the conflict unscathed. Thank the goddess! It seems that Derdriu was the only place to really get caught up in the fighting. Did Claude intend to spare the Alliance territories from harm? If so, he's a truly admirable leader. Speaking of Claude, I wonder where he is?"
13920,Lysithea: Something about Lord Arundel rubbed me the wrong way. There was something off about him. Not that I've ever heard anything good about him. Have you ever heard of the Hrym family?
13921,"Byleth:
Choice 1: From the Alliance?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's.
Choice 2: From the Empire? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: Correct. Their lands are due south of the Ordelia territory.
Choice 3: From the Kingdom?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's."
13922,"Choice 1: From the Alliance?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's."
13923,"Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's."
13924,"Choice 2: From the Empire? (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: Correct. Their lands are due south of the Ordelia territory."
13925,Lysithea: Correct. Their lands are due south of the Ordelia territory.
13926,"Choice 3: From the Kingdom?
Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's."
13927,"Lysithea: No, they're an Imperial house. Their territory is south of Ordelia's."
13928,"Lysithea: Since Edelgard's rule, Lord Arundel has been governing the territory. It seems like his reign was particularly cruel. The people there suffered greatly under him. He seemed to be a good and just person at one point. It simply doesn't make sense."
13929,"Marianne: Now that the Alliance has been dissolved, what will become of the nobility?"
13930,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm not sure.
Choice 2: Are you worried? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: No, my adoptive father knows how to get by. I'm sure he'll do well for himself in the Kingdom."
13931,Choice 1: I'm not sure.
13932,"Choice 2: Are you worried? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: No, my adoptive father knows how to get by. I'm sure he'll do well for himself in the Kingdom."
13933,"Marianne: No, my adoptive father knows how to get by. I'm sure he'll do well for himself in the Kingdom."
13934,Marianne: All of Fódlan is going to change... I suppose I'll have to change with it.
13935,"Hilda: The Alliance dissolved so suddenly. Now there's widespread pandemonium! The lords are warring! Mass confusion among the citizens! Or... that's what I expected to happen. None of that seems to be taking place. They had a roundtable meeting and talked it out. Everyone's dealing very calmly with the situation. I guess if Dimitri turns out to be a crazed despot, then there really will be chaos. But he's not going to go crazy again. He's OK now... Right?"
13936,"Leonie: The Death Knight is guarding Fort Merceus. The same one who was linked to Monica and to Flayn's abduction five years ago. Anyway, he's one of the monsters responsible for Captain Jeralt's death. We have to defeat him!"
13937,"Seteth: Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. Now that we know Rhea is there, we must move with the utmost urgency."
13938,"Flayn: The Death Knight. I shudder to think of him. Professor, you remember my connection to him, do you not?"
13939,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Of course. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Choice 2: Uh, what happened?
Flayn: What! You have forgotten about when I was kidnapped five years ago?!"
13940,Choice 1: Of course. (Relationship with Flayn up)
13941,"Choice 2: Uh, what happened?
Flayn: What! You have forgotten about when I was kidnapped five years ago?!"
13942,Flayn: What! You have forgotten about when I was kidnapped five years ago?!
13943,"Flayn: I am still working on the trauma from back then, all these years later. If we meet him, I swear I will have my revenge."
13944,"Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?"
13945,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Silver Maiden
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Choice 2: Fódlan's Locket
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
Choice 3: The Stubborn Old General (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
13946,"Choice 1: The Silver Maiden
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod."
13947,"Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod."
13948,"Choice 2: Fódlan's Locket
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat."
13949,Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
13950,"Choice 3: The Stubborn Old General (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
13951,"Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
13952,"Hanneman: Seems Fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose..."
13953,"Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived."
13954,"Gilbert: Even in the Kingdom, only a few people knew about His Higness and Edelgard's relationship. Me? I always knew those two to be like brother and sister. To think that we would come to see this world, where they are at war with one another... I live it, and I can still barely imagine such a truth."
13955,"Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Wish I'd known that five years ago, but there's nothing we can do about it now. What we can do though is topple the Empire! Will you seize victory with us, Professor? For the sake of the late captain!"
13956,"Catherine: We took quite the detour. It was time-consuming, but finally we got the information we needed. We crush the Empire, we get Lady Rhea back. Two birds, one stone. First, we take Fort Merceus. I'll put my heart in it. I'll crack 'em like a rusty helmet."
13957,"Shamir: Weren't the Kingdom and Alliance once part of the same country? If you think about it that way, it makes sense for them to unite. I suppose the Kingdom was once part of the Empire as well. Even if Fódlan came together, I wouldn't be surprised if it fell apart again"
13958,"Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was taken to the Empire? Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor... they didn't take her to kill her, did they?"
13959,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Choice 2: They probably haven't killed her. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
13960,"Choice 1: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?"
13961,"Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?"
13962,"Choice 2: They probably haven't killed her. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
13963,"Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
13964,Cyril: You gotta help her Professor. I'm begging ya.
13965,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone..."
13966,Monk: I've come here after getting chased out of the Empire. There's no place for our kind there anymore. But there are still many inside Empire territory who haven't abandoned their faith in the Church of Seiros. I pray that one day we'll get the chance to rebuild the church within the Empire...
13967,"Monk: I traveled to Kingdom territory because I was nearby. I did some good business! Apparently supplies are needed to reconstruct the Kingdom capital and the surrounding towns. Hmm, I wonder where I should go next..."
13968,"Soldier: Doesn't matter how sturdy the keep, if the commander defending it is incompetent, it can fall as easy as anything. That's what they say at least. I wonder if that applies to Fort Merceus... All I know is if I was the emperor, I'd never in a million years assign an incompetent commander to a fort as important as that one!"
13969,"Kingdom Knight: Have you heard of the Crescent Moon War? That's when the Alliance won their independence from the Kingdom. Some 300 years ago, the ruling duke of Leicester died without an heir. And the lords with blood ties to House Blaiddyd took that chance to propose ruling the Leicester territory as a republic. The head of House Riegan led the Leicester lords and fought fiercely with Faerghus. They won independence from the Kingdom, and now here we are."
13970,"Merchant: With the Empire destroyed, the borders within Fódlan will likely become a thing of the past. With that, the rules of trade will change. Personally, I'm excited to see what these changes will bring."
13971,"Citizen: The Alliance has really been disbanded? I never though such a thing could happen... As long as it doesn't negatively impact our lives, I don't care much whether we're the Kingdom or the Alliance."
13972,"Knight of Seiros: The archbishop has been taken to the Empire, just as we thought... But why hasn't Edelgard killed her yet? If she intended to use her as a hostage, she'd have publicly announced that she was unharmed... We don't know what the emperor's intentions are. All we can do is fight on and pray the archbishop is OK."
13973,"Monk: So we're finally invading Empire territory, huh? There's not much we can do right now, except pray for deliverance. I truly believe that we have it in us to succeed."
13974,Squire: We're finally going to attack the Empire? I'm actually getting a little nervous! Please defeat the emperor and save Lady Rhea! I'll be waiting here with all of the necessary preparations for a huge celebration!
13975,Yuri: We need to mop up the mess in the Kingdom quickly. My family lives in Faerghus. As do my people. I want to avoid exposing them to danger.
13976,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Your family?
Yuri: My mother. She's been ill for a long time now. Moving her away just isn't an option.
Choice 2: Your people?
Yuri: That's right. Those who work for me and with me. They've entrusted their lives to me. They trust me."
13977,"Choice 1: Your family?
Yuri: My mother. She's been ill for a long time now. Moving her away just isn't an option."
13978,Yuri: My mother. She's been ill for a long time now. Moving her away just isn't an option.
13979,"Choice 2: Your people?
Yuri: That's right. Those who work for me and with me. They've entrusted their lives to me. They trust me."
13980,Yuri: That's right. Those who work for me and with me. They've entrusted their lives to me. They trust me.
13981,"Yuri: So for them, more than anything, I hope we can end this swiftly and give everyone the lives they deserve."
13982,Balthus: So... Claude abandoned the Alliance and ran off. I have a pretty good idea of where he went. Where anyone would go in his situation. Somewhere he belongs.
13983,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What's he going to do there? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: He must've gone there to do something he can't achieve in Fódlan.
Choice 2: Where did he go?
Balthus: Heh, good question. Here's a hint... He's probably not in Fódlan anymore."
13984,"Choice 1: What's he going to do there? (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: He must've gone there to do something he can't achieve in Fódlan."
13985,Balthus: He must've gone there to do something he can't achieve in Fódlan.
13986,"Choice 2: Where did he go?
Balthus: Heh, good question. Here's a hint... He's probably not in Fódlan anymore."
13987,"Balthus: Heh, good question. Here's a hint... He's probably not in Fódlan anymore."
13988,"Balthus: He may be gone, but he left his troubles behind. Now it's on us to clean up his mess."
13989,"Constance: It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's goals, mind you. But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for her ideals."
13990,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Perhaps not. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: I must keep her example in mind as I chart a new path.
Choice 2: Some ideals are worth fighting for.
Constance: Of course. But I've gone down a different road."
13991,"Choice 1: Perhaps not. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: I must keep her example in mind as I chart a new path."
13992,Constance: I must keep her example in mind as I chart a new path.
13993,"Choice 2: Some ideals are worth fighting for.
Constance: Of course. But I've gone down a different road."
13994,Constance: Of course. But I've gone down a different road.
13995,Constance: Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!
13996,"Hapi: Everyone seems pumped about fighting the Empire at long last. Personally, I find it difficult to get excited about killing people, no matter what side they're on. I'm on yours. It's that simple. If you fought alongside the Imperial army, so would I."
13997,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. The Alliance is a thing of the past now. Times are changing fast these days. It's hard to keep up, even for me! I wonder if Abyss is on the verge of change too. Change leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty leads to...change? I dunno. I'm just a guard."
13998,"Suspicious Man: So the Alliance is finished, is it? The leader's gone? That damn prince. Seems my role here is at an end. No matter. Should another chance present itself, I'll take a less subtle route..."
13999,"Dimitri: Fort Merceus...said to rival Arianrhod, the Silver Maiden. Perhaps a head-on siege was a foolish plan, after all."
14000,"Gilbert: No, you're right that it's the only way. I don't think the Death Knight would have fallen for any tricks. Even if they are denied supplies, they could hold a fortress like this for months. And we cannot discount the possibility that they will receive more reinforcements if our siege is delayed."
14001,"Dimitri: Yes, my thoughts exactly. Then we have no option but to do the best we can. Say, Professor... In the past, it seemed the Death Knight took some strange satisfaction from his fights with you. He's an unpredictable opponent. A dangerous one. Please proceed with caution."
14002,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No need to worry.
Dimitri: I have not come this far just to lose you here. I'm serious. Do not be reckless out there.
Choice 2: Will you save me if I'm in trouble?
Dimitri: Of course. You were the heart of the Blue Lions, and the same holds true for the Kingdom Army."
14003,"Choice 1: No need to worry.
Dimitri: I have not come this far just to lose you here. I'm serious. Do not be reckless out there."
14004,Dimitri: I have not come this far just to lose you here. I'm serious. Do not be reckless out there.

14006,"Dimitri: Of course. You were the heart of the Blue Lions, and the same holds true for the Kingdom Army."
14007,Death Knight: (If Byleth is male) That man approaches...
14008,Death Knight: (If Byleth is female) That woman approaches...
14009,Caspar: (If Caspar was not recruited) They broke through the gates? Guess it's time for an impressive counterattack!
14010,Imperial Solider: (If Caspar was recruited) Report! The main gate has been breached!
14011,Linhardt: (If Linhardt was not recruited) Ugh... How did I get tangled up in all of this...
14012,Death Knight: You are finally here... Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours... And Mercedes... Here you are as well...
14013,"Dimitri: Fort Merceus... said to rival Arianrhod, the Silver Maiden. Perhaps a head-on siege was a foolish plan, after all."
14014,"Gilbert: No, you're right that it's the only way. I don't think the Death Knight would have fallen for any tricks.

14021,Dimitri: Mercedes...
14022,"Mercedes: So, the Death Knight really is inside that fortress. Dear Emile..."
14023,Dimitri: I want you to know that no one is forcing you to battle with us at the front lines. I support whatever you decide.
14024,"Mercedes: Please, stop. We can't have you saying that. You and I are the same after all. We both have to fight our family for the good of the world... And since that's the way it is, I couldn't live with myself if I was the only running away from this battle. I will bring Emile back to his senses. I must. I'm his big sister, after all."
14025,"Dimitri: Understood. Stay safe out there, Mercedes."
14026,Death Knight: (If Byleth is male) That man approaches...
14027,Death Knight: (If Byleth is female) That woman approaches...
14028,Imperial Solider: Report! The main gate has been breached!
14029,Linhardt: (If Linhardt was not recruited) Ugh... How did I get tangled up in all of this...
14030,Death Knight: You are finally here... Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours... And Mercedes... Here you are as well...
14031,Suggested Level: 39
14032,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
14033,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
14034,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
14035,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle.
14036,Death Knight: They broke through the main gate... Trample them. All save... that man...
14037,"Dimitri: Even though we smashed the main gate, Fort Merceus is still an ironclad fortress. And the enemy commander is the Death Knight. We must not falter in our assault!"
14038,"Dimitri: I now see why they call this keep impregnable. Everywhere you turn is defensive weaponry. We must capture all of those locations as we push forward. If even one of them takes a shot at you, we will be in trouble."
14039,Death Knight: Fools. Push forward and surround them...
14040,"Gilbert: Worrisome. They have a leader capable of summoning reinforcements. If we find and strike down that person, we can prevent further interruptions."
14041,"Gilbert: There will be no further reinforcements from this side. However, the other side is still in action."
14042,"Dimitri: If they call in more reinforcements, we'll be in great danger. We must take down the other commander as well and fast."
14043,Dimitri: Good. Now we should not have to worry about any more reinforcements crashing the party.
14044,Caspar: Did you have to kill a lot of your friends to get here? Cause I'm gonna give this fight everything I've got!
14045,"Caspar: It's way over my head, and I don't really get what's going on between you and Edelgard. I thought for sure you two would come to an understanding, but I guess I was wrong."
14046,"Caspar: Looks like we ended up on opposing sides, Linhardt!"
14047,"Linhardt: Certainly seems that way. I could almost weep over how things turned out. Do you realize, Caspar, that this is the first time we've ever fought?"
14048,"Caspar: Yeah, I think you're right. The first and probably the last!"
14049,Caspar: Don't worry about me... I always knew... losing meant death...
14050,"Linhardt: I'd rather not fight, yet avoiding it is more frustrating and fruitless than engaging in the battle itself."
14051,"Linhardt: Ever since returning to the Empire, I knew this day would arrive. I just hoped it might take a bit longer. Ugh..."
14052,"Caspar: Looks like we ended up on opposing sides, Linhardt!"
14053,"Linhardt: Certainly seems that way. I could almost weep over how things turned out. Do you realize, Caspar, that this is the first time we've ever fought?"
14054,"Caspar: Yeah, I think you're right. The first and probably the last!"
14055,Linhardt: I hope someday there will be no fighting and we can all just... nap the afternoon away...
14056,Death Knight: I have no need of you.
14057,"Death Knight: You're stronger now. Whether I kill you or you kill me, I'm looking forward to this!"
14058,Death Knight: You dare stand between me and my pleasure?
14059,"Dimitri: Yes. I dare stand against you, Death Knight."
14060,Death Knight: Death is all that remains...
14061,Mercedes: I came here to get you. Let's return together... Emile.
14062,Death Knight: Leave... The place of your death is not here...
14063,Death Knight: You. Leave.
14064,Mercedes: No! I won't! I... I refuse to run from you anymore!
14065,"Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!"
14066,Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
14067,Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!
14068,"Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!"
14069,Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
14070,"Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face."
14071,"Death Knight: To kill, to die... To know one without the other would be maddening..."
14072,"Dimitri: The enemy general has been vanquished! Everyone,move to gain control of the keep! Victory is ours! Raise the banner of the knights. May it soar proudly over the impregnable fortress!"
14073,Mercedes: (If The Face Beneath was completed and Mercedes and Annette are still on the map) Oh! I have to meet... I have to meet Emile!
14074,Mercedes: Emile... I'm so sorry... This is all my fault for leaving you behind when I left House Bartels. I should have gone back for you sooner...
14075,Jeritza: Argh...
14076,Mercedes: I'm sorry for not being a better sister to you.
14077,Jeritza: Mer...cedes...
14078,"Mercedes: Please forgive me, Emile..."
14079,"Annette: Mercie, we need to go. Now."
14080,Mercedes: ...Good-bye...
14081,"Gilbert: Your Highness, our capture of the fortress is complete."
14082,"Dimitri: Now the path to the Imperial Capital is finally opened to us. Once we've finished cleaning up after the battle, let's have another meeting to discuss our next move."
14083,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We should have a victory celebration.
Dimitri: It would be one thing if we were at home or at the monastery, but to waste our resources like that here would be most-
Choice 2: Aren't you overworking yourself?
Dimitri: Naturally. But it matters not. Consider this... Once this war is over, the mountain of official business on my plate will be even taller. If I can't handle at least this much, how will I-"

14087,"Dimitri: Naturally. But it matters not. Consider this... Once this war is over, the mountain of official business on my plate will be even taller. If I can't handle at least this much, how will I-"
14088,Kingdom Soldier: Pardon the interruption! We've just received a letter from Margrave Gautier.
14089,Dimitri: Very well. I will read it at once.
14090,(Byleth nods while the screen fades to black once and returns again.)
14091,Dimitri: I see... It seems the conflict within Faerghus has at last come to an end.
14092,"Kingdom Soldier: Yes, Your Highness! The Margrave and the other eastern lords are at the center of it, and are gathering the Kingdom's military forces even now, They intend to join with the Alliance army and send troops and supplies to the monastery."
14093,Sylvain: Whaddaya know... My old man is really pulling his weight. Did he seem well?
14094,"Kingdom Soldier: Yes, as well as can be expected. He has taken it upon himself to bring order back to our troubled territory while His Highness is away."
14095,"Dimitri: I am truly in the Margrave's debt. I will be sure to thank him properly at first opportunity. Thank you for the information. Now tell me, did it seem to you that my presence was needed back at the monastery?"
14096,Kingdom Soldier: Well... I do have a verbal message from the Margrave on the subject.
14097,Dimitri: A verbal message? How strange...
14098,"Kingdom Soldier: The other day, he arrested one of Viscount Kleiman's men. And, well... The prisoner has claimed involvement in the Tragedy of Duscur. He has implicated his lord as well."
14099,Dimitri: Go on.
14100,"Kingdom Soldier: I was told they would be transporting this man to the monastery along with the troops and supplies. The Margrave said that regardless of the credibility of the man's testimony, how he should be dealt with was your decision alone, Your Highness."
14101,"Dimitri: Very well. All things considered, I will return to the monastery at once. Will you come with me Professor? (Byleth nods.) Thank you."

14158,"The Kingdom army, having gathered new troops and significant strength, commences its march towards the Imperial capital of Enbarr. In response to their movements, Emperor Edelgard orders her trusted retainer, Hubert, to the front lines to meet the Kingdom army head-on. The two forces clash in the city streets.
"
14159,"Gilbert: Ah, there you are. His Highness was looking for you."
14160,Byleth: Where is he?
14161,"Gilbert: He's gone ahead, and started interrogating the prisoner–Viscount Kleiman's man. He said he'd like for you and I to be present as well. Will you come with me?"
14162,Dimitri: I cannot overlook your reckless remarks. Are you really so keen to lose your head?
14163,"Prisoner: I only did what I believed was right. I swear to the goddess that I'm not lying. Amidst the turmoil of the tragedy, Lady Patricia was supposed to be the only one who was unharmed. We had been given orders ahead of time to not approach her carriage..."
14164,Byleth: Was Patricia an accomplice?
14165,Dimitri: Of course not. What would my stepmother have had to gain from such a...
14166,Gilbert: Perhaps Lady Patricia would have done anything to return to the Empire...to her husband and daughter.
14167,Dimitri: What exactly are you implying?
14168,"Gilbert: For the past few months, I've been spying on lords who defected to the Empire in order to investigate rumors about Lady Patricia. Cornelia's words were true. The two of them... I am afraid they conspired together, after all."
14169,Dimitri: Enough of this nonsense. You say she wished to return home? That isn't nearly enough reason to cause such a tragedy.
14170,"Gilbert: (turns to Dimitri) I do not intend to imply that the two of them were solely responsible for the whole affair. There were likely nobles who opposed the king, or potentially someone who wanted to throw the Kingdom into chaos. The Empire, and people like Solon and Kronya, had their motives, too."
14171,Dimitri: So my stepmother joined with them to cause the tragedy... Is that what you believe?
14172,"Gilbert: Ultimately, this is just conjecture based on the evidence at hand. I have no idea what their true intentions were."
14173,Dimitri: I see. We will hear what this man has to say. For now...
14174,"Prisoner: My lord had long felt that King Lambert's radical ways were dangerous. At the time, he was approached with an offer to take part in the incident at Duscur... My lord loves his homeland. To me, he embodied justice. We were only doing what we thought was right."
14175,"Dimitri: And so, in the name of justice, he caused massacre upon massacre out of love for his homeland. You murdered your own king, killed our soldiers, and involved innocent citizens. And yet you have the gall to speak of justice?"
14176,Prisoner: I am only standing before you now because I could no longer bear the weight of my sins.
14177,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Did you share those feelings about your homeland?
Prisoner: Yes... I believe I do.
Choice 2: Do you regret your actions?
Prisoner: No. I accept your hatred, and even the punishment of death, but I still believe it was a massacre in the name of justice."
14178,"Choice 1: Did you share those feelings about your homeland?
Prisoner: Yes... I believe I do."
14179,Prisoner: Yes... I believe I do.
14180,"Choice 2: Do you regret your actions?
Prisoner: No. I accept your hatred, and even the punishment of death, but I still believe it was a massacre in the name of justice."
14181,"Prisoner: No. I accept your hatred, and even the punishment of death, but I still believe it was a massacre in the name of justice."
14182,Dimitri: Gilbert. Lock this man in his cell.
14183,Gilbert: Are you not...going to kill him?
14184,Dimitri: I will make that decision once I have had time to consider this man's definition of justice.
14185,"Gilbert: Yes, Your Highness."
14186,Dimitri: ...
14187,Byleth: Are you OK?
14188,"Dimitri: No... I cannot say that I am. Tell me, Professor... How well do you remember your father, Jeralt?"
14189,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Not very well.
Dimitri: I figured as much. Even the memory of those who pass away is taken from those they left behind. Little by little. Year by year.
Choice 2: Very well.
Dimitri: Soon enough you will come to understand how painful it is to forget the faces of those who have passed on."
14190,"Choice 1: Not very well.
Dimitri: I figured as much. Even the memory of those who pass away is taken from those they left behind. Little by little. Year by year."
14191,Dimitri: I figured as much. Even the memory of those who pass away is taken from those they left behind. Little by little. Year by year.
14192,"Choice 2: Very well.
Dimitri: Soon enough you will come to understand how painful it is to forget the faces of those who have passed on."
14193,Dimitri: Soon enough you will come to understand how painful it is to forget the faces of those who have passed on.
14194,"Dimitri: To be honest, I cannot really remember my stepmother's...that woman's smile. Nor the sound of her voice. I always told myself that I would not allow my mind to forget. And yet...all I can recall with clarity is her gazing away, so forlorn. Did my stepmother wish to go home so badly that she would kill Father and me...kill her false family? Home...to her own blood. Her true family."
14195,"Byleth:
Choice 1: There's no way to know for sure.
Choice 2: I don't have those answers."
14196,Choice 1: There's no way to know for sure.
14197,Choice 2: I don't have those answers.
14198,"Dimitri: I suppose it doesn't make any difference now. I am asking you questions you could not possibly know the answer to. I am finished with thoughts like that. I am finally able to go on living without clinging to hate. If I truly treasure those who have died, then I must earnestly atone for my sins. Father, Glenn, all of the soldiers who have fallen... The people of Duscur who still suffer persecution... The only atonement I can offer them now is to take responsibility for this broken Kingdom that has been entrusted to me."
14199,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's true.
Choice 2: Take responsibility for the Kingdom..."
14200,Choice 1: That's true.
14201,Choice 2: Take responsibility for the Kingdom...
14202,"Dimitri: That is why I feel that I must meet with Edelgard and try to talk to her. Do you think it's a fool's errand? Honestly... I think so too. But I must swallow my feelings and grudges–our whole history, really–and ask her about this future that she sees. What she aims for once her domination is complete. What kind of justice she clings to as she fights. And why she felt it necessary to start this war... I believe that asking her these things is the true responsibility I have been tasked with as king."
14203,Byleth: How will you accomplish this?
14204,"Dimitri: We will march our troops to the Imperial capital. But before any battle begins, we will set up camp nearby and send a messenger. I will tell her that I need to speak with her in a safe place, without any weapons or troops. As to whether or not she will agree to my request... Well, that rests solely on Edelgard."
14205,Byleth: I'm certain she'll agree.
14206,"Dimitri: I would like to believe that as well. You know, Professor... When we fought in Fhirdiad, Cornelia mocked me and called me pitiful. But even if it is true that my stepmother never loved me, I am not to be pitied. After all, I have allies and dear friends who care for me. And now, I also have you by my side."
14207,"Dimitri: Our next battlefield will be the Imperial capital. There will be no turning back. If you have any unfinished business here, you had best settle it before we depart."
14208,"Byleth:
Choice 1: There's not enough time.
Dimitri: I apologize, but you'll have to make do with the time you have. We cannot afford a delay.
Choice 2: Leave it to me.
Dimitri: I knew I could count on you. Good luck."
14209,"Choice 1: There's not enough time.
Dimitri: I apologize, but you'll have to make do with the time you have. We cannot afford a delay."
14210,"Dimitri: I apologize, but you'll have to make do with the time you have. We cannot afford a delay."
14211,"Choice 2: Leave it to me.
Dimitri: I knew I could count on you. Good luck."
14212,Dimitri: I knew I could count on you. Good luck.
14213,"Dedue: I believe in you, but please ensure that his Highness survives as well. Fódlan's future would be in peril if we lost him. I would not be able to go on."
14214,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Leave it to me. (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: Thank you,
Choice 2: I understand.
Dedue: Good."
14215,"Choice 1: Leave it to me. (Relationship with Dedue up)

14219,"Felix: He intends to speak to the emperor? She's his stepsister, I know, but this seems risky."

Choice 1: It's important.
Felix: Pah! I know that!
Choice 2: You're against it? (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: No, I'm not. I'm sure he's thought it through."
14221,"Choice 1: It's important.

14222,Felix: Pah! I know that!

Felix: No, I'm not. I'm sure he's thought it through."
14224,"Felix: No, I'm not. I'm sure he's thought it through."
14225,"Felix: If the two can settle this diplomatically, that would be the best way out of this mess. No more bloodshed. Let's just hope he doesn't become so overwhelmed with emotion that he's unable to strike her down... should the need arise."
14226,"Ashe: Returning to the monastery brings back so many memories from five years ago. Hard to believe we only spent a year together here. So much happened that it felt a lot longer than that. But it was so exciting. And so much fun. Honestly, I think those memories are what's kept me fighting this long. What was that year like for you, Professor?"
14227,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It was a lot of fun. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I don't think I could ask for a better answer.
Choice 2: It was challenging.
Ashe: Ah...yeah, there were a lot of hard times too."
14228,"Choice 1: It was a lot of fun. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I don't think I could ask for a better answer."
14229,Ashe: I don't think I could ask for a better answer.
14230,"Choice 2: It was challenging.
Ashe: Ah...yeah, there were a lot of hard times too."
14231,"Ashe: Ah...yeah, there were a lot of hard times too."
14232,"Ashe: Let's all do our best to survive this, so we can come back here when it's all over. I know that's what I'll be doing."
14233,"Sylvain: I've been thinking about how we've got our own ideas about justice...and so does the Empire. And what's coming, it's not just a battle between us and them. It's our ideals that are fighting. Whoever wins will say they were right and the other side was wrong. And I get it. That's how it goes... But nobody's willing to talk or compromise, so we'll fight to the death to prove the other guy's wrong. It won't be an easy battle, but let's make sure we come back alive. Right, Professor?"
14234,Mercedes: We'll be heading for the capital soon. So much rests on this moment. Will the war really be over if we take the capital?
14235,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It might not end right away.
Mercedes: You're probably right...but we'll get there eventually.
Choice 2: Definitely.
Mercedes: Yay! I'm sure it won't end right away, but that's still great news!"
14236,"Choice 1: It might not end right away.
Mercedes: You're probably right...but we'll get there eventually."
14237,Mercedes: You're probably right...but we'll get there eventually.
14238,"Choice 2: Definitely.
Mercedes: Yay! I'm sure it won't end right away, but that's still great news!"
14239,"Mercedes: Yay! I'm sure it won't end right away, but that's still great news!"
14240,Mercedes: I truly believe that a peaceful future is waiting at the end of all this.
14241,"Annette: I hope this is the final battle. Don't you, Professor? When the war is over, everyone will be busy with their own lives... But let's all meet up again someday. Right here at Garreg Mach. You, His Highness, my father, our monastery friends, the knights...everyone!"
14242,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's a great idea. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It was just a silly whim I had, but I really love it!
Choice 2: I wonder if that's possible...
Annette: All that matters is whether we choose to make it happen. I really hope that we do!"
14243,"Choice 1: That's a great idea. (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It was just a silly whim I had, but I really love it!"

14247,"Annette: Ooh, and I'll bake a bunch of desserts for it! Reunion sweets! All we have to do now is win! Let's get to it, Professor!"
14248,"Ingrid: I'm so glad you were assigned to the Blue Lion House, Professor. We made it this far thanks to your guidance and leadership. There's a bitter fight ahead - that much is certain. You have my lance."
14249,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're counting on you. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Choice 2: We will prevail!"
14250,Choice 1: We're counting on you. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
14251,Choice 2: We will prevail!
14252,Ingrid: Yes. Let's do this together!
14253,"Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. The Kingdom is battle-scarred, the Alliance is in tatters... People must be terrified. The world is crumbling around them. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild Fódlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor..."
14254,"Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle."
14255,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're far from being safe ourselves. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor.
Choice 2: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Choice 3: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good."
14256,"Choice 1: We're far from being safe ourselves. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor."

14262,Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
14263,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Are you trying to scare me? What if he turns up while we're charging the capital?!
Choice 2: It sounds like you're scared. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!"
14264,"Choice 1: You'll have to face him at some point.

14268,"Caspar: But still, I wonder what'll happen to him if we win..."
14269,"Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father, If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside."
14270,"Dorothea: I keep thinking the war is near its end, then it isn't... When can we finally put this dreadful war behind us?"
14271,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's end it with the next battle.
Dorothea: That would be wonderful. Imagine, the last moment of combat...then peace. It sounds like a fairy tale. I want to make this a world where there is no fighting, where children can grow up happy and safe.
Choice 2: There can be no end to war. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: I suppose you're right... But we should still try to make the world a place where children can grow up happy and safe."

14276,"Petra: Five years ago... Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding."
14277,"Lorenz: At last we've come to the final confrontation! Ruin to the Empire! Glory to Faerghus! Of course, to be perfectly honest, I would have much preferred to march against the Empire at the head of the Alliance. But I suppose I have Claude to thank for denying me that satisfaction, don't I?"
14278,Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?
14279,"Byleth
Choice 1: Mitreflanc Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!
Choice 2: Mittelfrank Opera Company (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Ah, that's the one!
Choice 3: Mildewplank Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
14280,"Choice 1: Mitreflanc Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
14281,"Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"

Raphael: Ah, that's the one!"
14283,"Raphael: Ah, that's the one!"
14284,"Choice 3: Mildewplank Opera Company
Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
14285,"Raphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right!"
14286,"Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see them perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we could at least see the building?"
14287,"Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how Fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it! On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?"
14288,Lysithea: Wanting so desperately to speak with Edelgard just as we're about to fight... Could it be that the prince is having doubts about killing her.
14289,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't think so.
Lysithea: Then perhaps it is okay.
Choice 2: It's only a formality. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I suppose they're the only ones who fully understand the extent of their relationship."
14290,"Choice 1: I don't think so.
Lysithea: Then perhaps it is okay."
14291,Lysithea: Then perhaps it is okay.
14292,"Choice 2: It's only a formality. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: I suppose they're the only ones who fully understand the extent of their relationship."
14293,Lysithea: I suppose they're the only ones who fully understand the extent of their relationship.
14294,Lysithea: He's certainly changed from the vengeful person he once was. I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm actually relieved. A king who's responsible for Fódlan's future can't exact personal vendettas and have a cold heart.
14295,Marianne: Dear Goddess...
14296,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Praying again?
Marianne: Yes... I was praying for your safety.
Choice 2: What are you praying for? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: Um...for your safety."
14297,"Choice 1: Praying again?
Marianne: Yes... I was praying for your safety."
14298,Marianne: Yes... I was praying for your safety.
14299,"Choice 2: What are you praying for? (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: Um...for your safety."
14300,Marianne: Um...for your safety.
14301,"Marianne: I'll do all I can to survive, but please...please don't die out there Professor."
14302,"Hilda: Fighting in the capital! Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine."
14303,"Leonie: At last, it's time to face the Flame Emperor... Edelgard. I know that the future of all Fódlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!"
14304,Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.
14305,"Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in the church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable."
14306,"Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the damned place since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined. Especially as I'm returning to end the Empire. What a strange feeling, breaking one's history."
14307,"Manuela: Life can be tough, you know? But if you've got your friends to help you through, it can be a lot easier. Maybe you butt heads sometimes...but that's OK. That's how you build bonds, right? And I've got friends, Professor. Plenty of those. It's true love that seems to have passed me by."
14308,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
Choice 2: There's still hope. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?
Choice 3: Time to give up?
Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option."
14309,"Choice 1: You should relax.
Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed."
14310,Manuela: Relax? I'm relaxed.
14311,"Choice 2: There's still hope. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?"
14312,Manuela: But where is my true love to be found? Where is my ray of hope?

Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option."
14314,Manuela: Yeah... I'm starting to figure that's the most realistic option.
14315,"If Byleth is male:
Manuela: At this point, you're the only man who pays attention to me. I guess I'll have to take what I can get."
14316,"Manuela: At this point, you're the only man who pays attention to me. I guess I'll have to take what I can get."
14317,"If Byleth is female:
Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!"
14318,"Manuela: At this point, I'm just hoping you stay single too. Then at least we can share each other's misery!"
14319,"Gilbert: It matters not how just our cause may be. In the end, war is nothing more than organized murder. I understand the desire to reach a conclusion, but we mustn't overlook the sins inherent in our deeds."
14320,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am well aware. (Relationship with Gilbert up)
Choice 2: I understand, of course."
14321,Choice 1: I am well aware. (Relationship with Gilbert up)
14322,"Choice 2: I understand, of course."
14323,"Gilbert: Heh, sorry, I have a tendency to preach. We have lost so much, and in return, we have taken much from our enemies. I pray we can put an end to this cycle of violence."
14324,"Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. He's watching over us now, protecting us. I know he is."
14325,Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
14326,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Probably. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: (laughs) I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings."
14327,"Choice 1: Probably. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: (laughs) I was just kidding! Pay me no mind."
14328,Catherine: (laughs) I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.

Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings."
14330,Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings.
14331,"Catherine: Lady Rhea is not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you."
14332,"Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. Their final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. We spent a lot of time going back and forth, but at least we made it this far."
14333,"Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?"
14334,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll meet her for sure. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Choice 2: We don't know for sure."
14335,Choice 1: We'll meet her for sure. (Relationship with Cyril up)
14336,Choice 2: We don't know for sure.
14337,Cyril: I just gotta believe Lady Rhea is waiting for us in the capital... We just have to find her.
14338,"Anna: Seems like the war is gonna end soon. Once the dust settles, it'll be back to rolling in fat stacks of gold for me!"
14339,Yuri: ...
14340,"Byleth:
Choice 1: This is a rare sight.
Yuri: How would you know what's rare and what isn't? I still believe in the goddess, sort of.
Choice 2: Are you praying?
Yuri: I am. It's a bit of a ritual for me to pray before something big like this."
14341,"Choice 1: This is a rare sight.
Yuri: How would you know what's rare and what isn't? I still believe in the goddess, sort of."
14342,"Yuri: How would you know what's rare and what isn't? I still believe in the goddess, sort of."
14343,"Choice 2: Are you praying?
Yuri: I am. It's a bit of a ritual for me to pray before something big like this."
14344,Yuri: I am. It's a bit of a ritual for me to pray before something big like this.
14345,"Yuri: I couldn't recount a single word of scripture for you. But my mother always prayed. I picked up the habit from her. Believe it or not, I'm praying for you too. For you to come back safe."
14346,"Balthus: I hear that damn Dimitri guy plans to chat with the emperor. Can you believe that nonsense? Really, though. We've been trying to kill each other, and he wants to shoot the breeze? Is he dumb or just insane?"
14347,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Maybe you're right. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: No ""maybes"" about it, pal. You ask me, they should settle it like civilized folk—with their fists.
Choice 2: You're wrong.
Balthus: That a fact? Heh, you two are birds of a feather. You ask me, they should throw some fists and be done with it."
14348,"Choice 1: Maybe you're right. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: No ""maybes"" about it, pal. You ask me, they should settle it like civilized folk—with their fists."
14349,"Balthus: No ""maybes"" about it, pal. You ask me, they should settle it like civilized folk—with their fists."
14350,"Choice 2: You're wrong.
Balthus: That a fact? Heh, you two are birds of a feather. You ask me, they should throw some fists and be done with it."
14351,"Balthus: That a fact? Heh, you two are birds of a feather. You ask me, they should throw some fists and be done with it."
14352,"Balthus: Guess it's up to the One True King of Grappling to talk some sense into ol' Dimitri. When I'm done with him, he'll be ready to brawl!"
14353,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!"
14354,"Merchant: Sorry, but I'm not the fighting type. All I can do is lend you the stuff you need. And, you know, pray to the goddess for your safety. Win, live, and return, OK? Mostly so you can pay me back for the stuff you borrowed!"
14355,"Monk: Did you know? A magnificent canal flows through downtown Enbarr. It's said to have been constructed under the guidance of Saint Seiros before the Empire was even formed. Ever since, that canal has been a major lifeline for the capital's development. And now this is how the Empire repays it... Truly, no good deed goes unpunished."
14356,Kingdom Knight: Attacking the capital means crossing swords with the emperor herself. I hope you won't be caught unprepared. I've heard that she'll stop at nothing in the pursuit of victory. Be careful of that Hubert too. The Minister of the Imperial Household. They say he's a cunning strategist.
14357,"Soldier: I've got a bit of Duscur blood in me. Faerghus is our ancestral enemy. But if that man is going to be the king, I don't see any harm in lending him my blade. I believe that we can forge a proud, new Kingdom. As you can tell, I'm expecting great things. I won't forgive you if you lose!"
14358,"Knight of Seiros: It's very likely that Lady Rhea is confined in the Imperial palace. If so, then our strategy will be to gain control of the streets, and then assault the castle. A street battle followed by a castle invasion... It's just one battle after another. It'll be tough, but we have to win. For Lady Rhea."
14359,"Citizen: Once you set out on your next mission, you won't be able to have a proper meal for a while, right? You should eat up while you can, build up your physical strength to prepare for the mission."
14360,"Soldier: I...I used to work for Cornelia in Fhirdiad. I only followed her because I didn't want to die, but afterwards I felt so ashamed I wanted to die anyway. I still can't figure out why I did it... Anyway, I'm glad you did what you did. From now on, I'm going to devote myself to the Kingdom, and fight for what I believe in!"
14361,"Boy: I wonder what the emperor looks like... I bet she's really scary. Oh, you don't think so? I've never seen her, so I was just guessing. She tried to destroy the Kingdom and the Alliance, and ordered the capture of the archbishop, right? I dunno... Someone who could do such terrible things just has to be really scary looking!"
14362,"Merchant: While on some business, I went to see how the Kingdom capital is getting on. There are still some things to work out before it can be restored. But generally, things seem to have calmed down. It's on its way to resuming its old energy. I think this will end up being a better Kingdom than before. I really believe that."
14363,Constance: Is it true what they say? That the archbishop is a captive of the Empire? I've never heard of anything so brash in all the Empire's long history. It is vexing that Lady Edelgard's true motives elude me. If only I still had noble connections to draw on... The loss of my house has proven to be a thorn in my side again and again.
14364,"Hapi: The war might be over soon. All this time we've been fighting, and the end comes in the blink of an eye. I have no idea what I'll do afterwards, though. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it."
14365,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should figure it out now.
Hapi: Easy for you to say. You obviously know what you're going to do. Which is...what, exactly?
Choice 2: It's OK to take your time. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I will. Though you already seem to know what you're going to do. Which is...what, exactly?"
14366,"Choice 1: You should figure it out now.
Hapi: Easy for you to say. You obviously know what you're going to do. Which is...what, exactly?"

Hapi: I will. Though you already seem to know what you're going to do. Which is...what, exactly?"
14369,"Hapi: I will. Though you already seem to know what you're going to do. Which is...what, exactly?"
14370,"Hapi: Actually, don't tell me your plans just yet. Let's revisit this topic when the war has drawn to a close."
14371,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. The war is careening headfirst toward its grand finale. Do me a favor and get through this mess alive, OK? After the dust settles, maybe I'll go on to guard other entrances in other parts of the world. I'm a dreamer, my friend. Always have been."
14372,"Hapi: We're getting along a lot better with the Kingdom soldiers recently. Everyone's in higher spirits. When they first got here, some of them were aggressive toward us...even abusive. All that's changed now. They've been courteous with us. Generous, even. It's nice to see."
14373,Dimitri: Professor. Do you think Edelgard will show up?
14374,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She will.
???: Well, well. It's been a long time, Professor. And hello to you, too, Dimitri.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
???: Sorry to disappoint you, Professor."
14375,"Choice 1: She will.
???: Well, well. It's been a long time, Professor. And hello to you, too, Dimitri."
14376,"???: Well, well. It's been a long time, Professor. And hello to you, too, Dimitri."
14377,"Choice 2: I doubt it.
???: Sorry to disappoint you, Professor."
14378,"???: Sorry to disappoint you, Professor."
14379,Dimitri: Edelgard. I did not think you would actually accept my request.
14380,Edelgard: Call it a whim. Well then? What did you want to talk about?
14381,Dimitri: I will get straight to the point. Why did you start this war? There had to be a way to change things in your territory without the need for so many senseless casualties.
14382,"Edelgard: It may be hard to believe, but this is the way that leads to the fewest casualties in the end. Don't you see?"
14383,Dimitri: How could I? Countless people have already lost their lives in this conflict.
14384,"Edelgard: The longer we took to revolt, the more victims this crooked world would have claimed. I weighed the victims of war against the victims of the world as it is now, and I chose the former. I believe that I have chosen the best path, the only path."
14385,"Dimitri: Even after seeing the faces of those who have suffered the ravages of war, you would still force them to throw their lives away for the future? You are obsessively devoted to this war and deaf to the screams of its victims. You cannot change the cycle of the strong dominating the weak with a method like that."
14386,"Edelgard: You're wrong. That very cycle is exactly what I have devoted my life and my power to destroying. If after all of this you believe the weak will still be weak, that is only because they are too used to relying on others instead of on themselves."
14387,"Dimitri: Yes. Perhaps someone as strong as you are can claim something like that. But you cannot force that belief onto others. People aren't as strong as you think they are. There are those who cannot live without their faith...and those who cannot go on once they have lost their reason for living. Your path will not be able to save them. It is the path of the strong, and so, it could only benefit the strong."
14388,"Edelgard: Heh, so you consider me strong, do you? Even if one clings to their faith, the goddess will never answer them. Countless souls will be lost that way. Living without purpose. And I can be counted among those who have died that way as well. But that's why I must change this world, on behalf of the silent and weak!"
14389,"Dimitri: And do you intend to become a goddess yourself? Will you steal the power to take action from the broken-hearted masses you claim to defend? The ones who can truly change the way of the world are not the rulers, but the people. Pushing your own sense of justice and your own ideals onto even one other person is no more than self-righteousness."
14390,"Edelgard: Maybe it is self-righteousness, but it doesn't matter. Someone has to take action and put a stop to this world's endless, blood-stained misery!"
14391,"Dimitri: Do you not believe in the power of people to join together and rise up? Humans are weak creatures. But they are also creatures who help each other, support each other, and together, find the right path. I have learned that humans are capable of all that from the professor...and from everyone in my life."
14392,Edelgard: I doubt a highborn person like yourself could know how the poor feel or what motivates them.
14393,"Edelgard: This is nonsense. Thought, I'm finally starting to understand how you feel. But that makes it even clearer to me that we can never fully understand each other."
14394,Dimitri: I feel the same. I finally understand...what you believe is right.
14395,"Edelgard: Good-bye, Dimitri."
14396,"Dimitri: Wait, Edelgard. There is something I must give you."
14397,Dimitri: This is for you. Use it to cut a path to the future you wish for. And I will rise up to meet you there...El.
14398,Edelgard: ...
14399,Dimitri: El! So it's true... You're really going away? Going back home?
14400,Edelgard: There's nothing I can do about it. It's all happening so fast... I'm as surprised as you are.
14401,Dimitri: El... Um... Here. I want you to have this.
14402,"Dimitri: El, listen to me. No matter how hard things get, you can't give in, OK? You've got to cut a path to the future you wish for, no matter what."
14403,Edelgard: It's...a dagger? Why would you give me something like this?
14404,"Dimitri: Oh, um... I'm sorry. I couldn't think of anything better to give you."
14405,Lord Arundel: Edelgard! What are you doing? It's time to go. Hurry and get in the carriage.
14406,"Edelgard: Oh! I... I'm sorry, Uncle! I have to go now... Good-bye, Dimitri."
14407,"Edelgard: I...I remember now. You gave me a dagger, all those years ago."
14408,"Dimitri: Heh, I'm still sorry about that. I should have given you something that would've made you happier."
14409,"Edelgard: Perhaps. At the time, I was quite flustered by such a dangerous gift. I left without giving you a proper response...and that was the last time we saw each other."
14410,Dimitri: True. It is a sweet memory with a bitter ending.
14411,"Edelgard: I'm afraid it will do no good to reminisce, Dimitri. That girl you knew back then is gone. As good as dead. But...I'll tell you now what I wasn't able to tell you back then. Thank you. My dear, forgotten friend...because of you, I never lost my heart. As for the future...that will be decided in battle. King of Faerghus. As the emperor, I shall await your arrival in Enbarr."
14412,Dimitri: ...
14413,"Jeralt: Sorry... It looks like...I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her."
14414,Byleth: (Someone I love...)
14415,Suggested Level: 41
14416,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
14417,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
14418,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
14419,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle.
14420,"Dimitri: The gates to the Imperial capital have been broken. All troops, storm in! The emperor is within reach!"
14421,"Gilbert: The Imperial troops are dug in across the city. Let's cut through them, and carve a route to the palace."
14422,"Hubert: Heh. The Savior King arrives, hands red with blood. Let's give him a royal welcome. Artillery, once the enemy is in range, fire at will. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Keep your focus and hold steady until they arrive."
14423,Dorothea: Reinforcements should be here soon. Let's draw them in... just like we planned. (If Dorothea was not recruited)
14424,Hubert: Draw them toward the opera house. Reinforcements will be here any moment. (If Dorothea was recruited)
14425,Manuela: Has it really been so long since I was in that opera house? Couldn't have imagined any of this back then.
14426,Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.
14427,Flayn: That church... It looks familiar. I believe that is where my parents first met.
14428,Seteth: Ah—that church. I've such memories of that place. From a time before I was Seteth...
14429,Thief: War is for the wealthy. We don't even have enough to eat... I'm sure the goddess won't punish us for a little bit of thievery here and there...
14430,"Dimitri: More reinforcements, eh? And this time it looks like a fair number... It would be best if we could take them down from a safe distance... Is there any way we could neutralize the cannons or catapults?"
14431,Dorothea: The battle is nearing the opera house. I hope everyone in the company is safe.
14432,"Dorothea: Oh, that face brings back some memories. It's a shame we don't have time to catch up."
14433,Dorothea: Manuela? It's not like you to show up anywhere sober. What's the occasion?
14434,Manuela: I thought maybe we could talk. I could help you see the error of your ways. Or we could just try to kill each other over what we believe in. You ready to do this?
14435,Dorothea: No... But let's get to it.
14436,"Dorothea: If it's our destiny to kill each other, then I cannot–will not–respect the goddess. My only request is that if you win, you'll at least have the decency to kill me quickly."
14437,"Dorothea: Edelgard, forgive me... I can't..."
14438,"Hubert: So, Dorothea has been defeated. We will need to thin their numbers as well, or else. If House Varley's troops arrive in time, we may be able to flank the Kingdom's army..."
14439,"Hubert: So, they've stopped our reinforcements. We will need to thin their numbers as well, or else. If House Varley's troops arrive in time, we may be able to flank the Kingdom's army..."
14440,Petra: For Adrestia and for Brigid! I will be defeating all of you!
14441,Petra: Professor... I have been thinking. About why I came to Fódlan. To the Empire. I am here to be protecting Edelgard...and to be stopping you.
14442,Shamir: I cannot bring myself to kill you... You're a princess of Brigid. A hostage of the Empire.
14443,"Petra: That was the truth in the past, but it is a different truth now, Shamir... I am... the will of the emperor!"
14444,"Shamir: In that case, I won't hold back."
14445,"Petra: Edelgard... I will not be keeping my promise... Give me forgiveness, please..."
14446,Hubert: It's almost a shame to kill you. Not even death will make you consequential.
14447,Hubert: I should have disposed of you a long time ago. I will rectify that failure here!
14448,Hubert: Running into you in the capital like this-I have to say it's almost sentimental.
14449,Ferdinand: Hubert. She must leave.
14450,Hubert: You really think you can make her?
14451,Ferdinand: It does not matter what I think. Those are my orders.
14452,"Dimitri: Hubert. I would tell you to get out of my way, but I highly doubt that you would abide."
14453,Hubert: Heh. Your silver tongue will do you no good here. This is not your path to tread.
14454,"Dimitri: That is not your decision to make, nor is it mine. All I can do is blaze ahead!"
14455,Hubert: We must place our faith...in Her Majesty... Her victory is everything...
14456,Dimitri: It's over... The way to the palace is clear. Let's move!
14457,"Dimitri: Send your platoons to capture Enbarr! There is to be no needless killing or pillaging, understand?"
14458,"Kingdom General: Yes, Your Highness!"
14459,Dimitri: Edelgard awaits us. We will advance our main forces straight to the palace.
14460,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We've finally made it here.
Choice 2: We can win this."
14461,Choice 1: We've finally made it here.
14462,Choice 2: We can win this.
14463,"Dimitri: Yes, it has truly been a long war. And we have only made it this far because of you... Actually, no. I will save that sentiment for after we win this battle. We will advance our troops and confront her. We must strike down the emperor and end this war."
14464,"Dedue: My life is yours, Your Highness."
14465,Annette: Let's win this and go back home in victory! I'll do the very best I can!
14466,Ingrid: On my honor as a knight...I will not lose!
14467,Mercedes: I know the goddess is watching over us. Let's be sure to return home safely. All of us.
14468,"Ashe: As a citizen of Faerghus, I will fight with everything I have!"
14469,"Sylvain: Heh heh heh, is this what a do-or-die situation looks like? You had best give it your all too, General."
14470,Felix: The path to the emperor is open. Fulfill your duty as our king.
14471,"Felix: Go and win. Be the boar you are, and don't you dare look back."
14472,Byleth: Let's go!
14473,Dimitri: Yes. I will... No. We will win this. Together! Everyone! Move out!
14474,Edelgard: The time has nearly come.
14475,"Imperial General: Yes, the anomaly should present itself shortly. However..."
14476,"Edelgard: There's no reason to fret. Besides, it's far too late to second guess. Now, assume your position. I can't promise your safety if you remain here."
14477,Imperial General: Very well. (Bows and leaves)
14478,Edelgard: Ugh... This pain is nothing...compared to what I have already suffered...

14482,"After storming the streets of Enbarr and bringing Imperial forces to their knees, the Kingdom army surrounds the Imperial palace. But the enemy that awaits them is not the Edelgard they once knew...
"
14483,"A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. The long reign of the Adrestian Empire finally met its end when the Imperial Capital, the city of Enbarr collapsed. After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. With Fódlan united as the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Archbishop Rhea, still weak from her imprisonment, stepped down from her position, and the Church of Seiros began to take the needed steps to reorganize. Prince Dimitri formally ascended the throne, beginning his reign as the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, which now included former Alliance and Imperial territories. Texts from the time claimed that the one who guided the king as he sought to create a world free from oppression became the new archbishop of the Church of Seiros.
"
14484,"Dimitri: We have annihilated Enbarr's army. If we strike her down now, this war will finally be over. I imagine she intends to keep fighting until the bitter end...If this is the end she has chosen, it is my responsibility to see it through with her. Isn't that so...emperor of Adrestia? We have no choice but to destroy each other...Such is the destiny we were born to. That is why...I will now rise up to answer her iron will with the bite of my lance."
14485,Dedue: I will protect you at all costs. We will both live to see tomorrow...Your Majesty.
14486,"Felix: Hmph. If the king falls here, that would mean my father's and brother's deaths were in vain."
14487,"Ashe: For Lonato, Christophe, everyone...I will not lose!"
14488,"Sylvain: Well, if I were to die now, I'd have a lot to explain to my brother."
14489,Mercedes: All will be OK. I know we can win!
14490,"Annette: I won't falter, no matter who we're facing!"
14491,Ingrid: For all those who have lost their lives in this war...We cannot lose!
14492,Byleth: Let's win this!
14493,"Dimitri: It is time. Onward, to our final battle!"
14494,"Hegemon Edelgard: They are here...But my progress cannot be stopped, no matter how many people try. The war's end will spell destruction for one of us. There can only be one ruler of the world..."

(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Dimitri falls in battle."
14497,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.

14499,"Dimitri: Edelgard must be in the throne room...I would love nothing more than charge in and settle this once and for all, but we must be mindful of the surrounding forces."
14500,"Ingrid: Strange...The mages don't seem to be wearing their usual imperial uniforms.
Gilbert (if Ingrid was not deployed): Look at the mages. They are not wearing their standard Imperial uniforms..."
14501,Gilbert (if Ingrid was not deployed): Look at the mages. They are not wearing their standard Imperial uniforms...
14502,Myson: We cannot allow our grand ambition to be stopped by these beasts...
14503,"Dimitri: Gah! Where did that attack come from?! If we do not find out, we have no chance of avoiding it!"
14504,"Mercedes: We're in danger! Advance with caution!
Dimitri (if Mercedes was not deployed): Everyone, stay on your guard!"
14505,"Dimitri (if Mercedes was not deployed): Everyone, stay on your guard!"
14506,Dimitri: I can hear voices from the lower levels...Could it be enemy reinforcements?
14507,"Ashe: Maybe if we take control of those stairwells now, we can prevent reinforcements.
Gilbert (if Ashe was not deployed): Avoid losses by taking control of the stairwells! Block the enemy reinforcements!"
14508,Gilbert (if Ashe was not deployed): Avoid losses by taking control of the stairwells! Block the enemy reinforcements!
14509,"Dimitri: So...that grotesque creature was Edelgard...If she is prepared to transform her very body to fight for this future of hers... Then I have no choice but to defeat her, even if it costs me my life! We must defend the present... After all, it is all that we truly have."
14510,Dimitri: Reinforcements from the lower levels... Will they ever stop coming?
14511,"Sylvain: General, calm down! Get control of the stairwells. Cut off the enemy's entry point.
Gilbert (if Sylvain was not deployed): We can't let this fight drag on. Get control of the stairwells! Block the enemy's entry point!"

14519,Hegemon Edelgard: These fools are caught up in the sacrifices at hand and can't see the future ramifications at stake. We must bury them! We must trample the past underfoot and move on to a brighter tomorrow!
14520,Hegemon Edelgard: You shall be obliterated! I will take you out so fast you will not have a chance to lament.
14521,"Dimitri: To be changed beyond all recognition.. That is what lies at the end of the ideals you served so diligently. I have no pity for one such as you. If that is the future you hoped for, then you deserve no compassion."

14570,"Reception Hall | Afternoon
"
14571,"In Imperial Year 1181, the New Adrestian Emperor, Edelgard von Hresvelg, led a strategic assault against the monastery at Garreg Mach. Though her own losses were great, her foes had no choice but to surrender. Archbishop Rhea commanded the Knights of Seiros, leading from the front lines against the Imperial Army. But amidst the chaos of battle, she vanished, and her whereabouts remain unknown. With this single attack, the Adrestian Empire officially launched its offensive against the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus and the Leicester Alliance. The unification of Fódlan has begun.
"
14572,Rhea: Unforgivable! I cannot believe that the Adrestian Empire would embark on such a violent course of action.
14573,Seteth: The fault is my own. I failed to see the wickedness within Edelgard's heart.
14574,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?
Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
14575,"Choice 1: Is she wicked?
Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
14576,"Seteth: She plotted with ill-meaning strangers to achieve her own ambitions and defiled the Holy Tomb. If that is not wicked, what is?"
14577,"Choice 2: What is her objective?
Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
14578,"Seteth: There is no question on that front. She clearly wishes to conquer all of Fódlan. And in order to achieve her own selfish ambitions, she plotted with ill-meaning strangers and defiled the Holy Tomb."
14579,Seteth: Or perhaps her ambitions are even grander than we know. Perhaps she is planning to make herself a false deity by demonizing the Church of Seiros...
14580,Rhea: Adrestia received its very name through a divine oracle. To injure the goddess is a sin most foul that shall not be forgiven nor forgotten. We must stop the Empire...and quickly.
14581,"Shamir: I have returned, Rhea."
14582,"Rhea: Welcome back, Shamir. Were you able to discern the Empire's movements?"
14583,Shamir: Their main troops are marching towards Garreg Mach. It is said that they will join forces with Edelgard's army and arrive within two weeks.
14584,Seteth: Two weeks? That is not enough time! It will require all of our efforts just to prepare our defenses before then. We must send notice to all surrounding villages at once. We must order the residents of Garreg Mach to flee for their lives.
14585,Shamir: It will be done.
14586,"Rhea: …Professor…listen closely. If our enemy invades the monastery, I will have no choice but to stand upon the battlefield. If something happens to me...I am entrusting my sacred duties to you."
14587,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why me?
Choice 2: Sacred duties?"
14588,Choice 1: Why me?
14589,Choice 2: Sacred duties?
14590,"Rhea: You must have guessed it by now. The truth of who you are. Or perhaps I should say, your lost memories are surely beginning to return. I have acted all these long years as a mere proxy for you. But the duty is yours and yours alone. Only you can lead the people of Fódlan."
14591,"Seteth: …Rhea, please. You must tell me all that you know. I beg of you."
14592,Rhea: …
14593,Seteth: That one…is the progenitor god. Am I correct?
14594,"Rhea: In a sense. Our dear professor is…a vessel. One who carries the power of the progenitor god within. In time, the vessel will become one with the power contained within, and the progenitor god shall return to this world."
14595,Seteth: I see. I trust that you are aware of the questionable nature of this experiment? But I suppose there is no turning back…
14596,"Rhea: I ask that you help our friend…and in doing so, help her. I am waiting and hoping for the moment when our creator rules this wayward land once more."
14597,"Seteth: I am sorry, but I cannot do this. I am not certain it is just…"
14598,Rhea: I see. That is a shame.
14599,"Seteth: I understand. As ever, I will take you at your word."
14600,"Flayn: Lady Rhea, Brother, I will do my part as well!"
14601,"Seteth: Flayn! Were you eavesdropping? Regardless, I am glad to hear it. You owe your life to the professor, after all. And in the end, they may prove to be our brethren."
14602,"Rhea: You have my gratitude, Seteth. And you as well, Flayn. As followers of the progenitor god, it is up to us to see our mission through."
14603,Byleth: …
14604,Dimitri: … I'll have that girl's head. Just you wait…
14605,"Claude: The Empire is moving quickly. Edelgard must have been preparing for this for a while now. If you really think about it, she must have been planning for this even before you got the Sword of the Creator… Of course she was always a step ahead of us. We were blinded by the ball and the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, and everything else… I refuse to go down like this, though. So let's do something about it. What do you say? It's you and me, Teach. We've got this."
14606,"Ferdinand: Half of the Empire's six great noble families have declared their support for Edelgard. Of the other three, Lord Vestra was assassinated. Hubert, his son, will succeed him. Bernadetta's father, Count Varley, is under house arrest. His wife is now supporting Edelgard. And my father…he was stripped of his role as prime minister. As as result, House Aegir has lost all of its power, all of its land. We have lost everything. I…I… What do I do?"
14607,"Linhardt: The most important nobles in the Empire are known for taking power from the previous emperor, my father included. I didn't think it possible that the Imperial princess could ascend the throne so easily. However, it seems that both my father and Caspar's are supporting Edelgard... Having both the Minister of Domestic Affairs and Minister of Military Affairs on your side gives you total control over the Empire's military and finances. They must have been making preparations for quite some time without anyone noticing..."
14608,"Caspar: I don't normally have a problem jumping into a fight, but it feels strange going up against my father. We aren't especially close, but he's not an opponent I'd want to face. I'd almost rather fight a monster! I hope he's not part of the group coming to attack Garreg Mach…"
14609,"Bernadetta: What does war with Edelgard mean for us, Professor? And why does she even want that?"
14610,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her.
Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that…"
14611,"Choice 1: I don't know.
Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
14612,"Bernadetta: Yeah, I guess we'd have to ask her."
14613,"Choice 2: She seems to think force is the only way.
Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that…"
14614,Bernadetta: I wonder why she'd think that…
14615,"That's how it always goes, I guess. You never realize something can't be undone until you've done it."
14616,"Dorothea: Edelgard became emperor and raised an army, huh? Who knew the kid had it in her? I mean, yeah, of course, I knew she'd be emperor eventually, but... The more I think about it, the more surprised I am. I wonder who's going to win..."
14617,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Us or her, you mean?
Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?
Choice 2: We will not lose. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out…"
14618,"Choice 1: Us or her, you mean?
Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?"
14619,Dorothea: But would it really be OK for Edelgard to win?
14620,"Choice 2: We will not lose. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out…"
14621,"Dorothea: Thinking about it makes me scared. We're up against the entire Imperial army! Still, I know someone as smart as you will figure something out…"
14622,Petra: I am owing big debts to Duke Gerth of the Empire. He is the Minister of Affairs that are Foreign. He is a friend of Edelgard. He is to her side. What should I be doing?
14623,"Petra: I have had the arrival of a letter from Edelgard. She is asking...that I join her side. She is making the decision…no, she is deciding if Brigid is a friend or an enemy of the Empire. But my choice is not to be friends. My choice is to fight with you. Brigid is not a friend of the Empire. We will not be following again. We will be ready to fight with you instead."
14624,"Dedue: His Highness calls for the head of Edelgard. For me, that is cause enough to fight."
14625,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
Choice 2: You're truly all right with that? (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant."
14626,"Choice 1: That is against the teachings of the goddess.
Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now."
14627,Dedue: Perhaps. But it is too late to stop him now.
14628,"Choice 2: You're truly all right with that? (Relationship with Dedue up)
Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant."
14629,Dedue: The hatred of His Highness is also my hatred. Any other feelings I may have are irrelevant.
14630,"Dedue: And if Edelgard was responsible in any way for the Tragedy of Duscur, that is something I cannot ignore. If that is the case, then she is my enemy."
14631,"Felix: That girl's starting an all-out war, isn't she? But an enemy is an enemy, no matter who they are. Don't let compassion for her get in your way."
14632,"Annette: Once the Imperial army reaches the monastery, we'll have no choice but to fight..."
14633,Ashe: What's going to happen to us?
14634,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Everything will be all right. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!
Choice 2: I can't say for sure.
Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
14635,"Choice 1: Everything will be all right. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!"
14636,"Ashe: I believe you. With the knights on our side, and especially with you, Professor, I know we can do this!"
14637,"Choice 2: I can't say for sure.
Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
14638,"Annette: Oh. Well, we'll just have to try our best."
14639,"Sylvain: Things must be pretty crazy in Faerghus about now. My father must be beside himself. I don't get it. Why did Edelgard make enemies with the nobles?
Choice 1: I have no idea. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Me either… Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?
Choice 2: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
14640,"Choice 1: I have no idea. (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Me either… Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?"
14641,"Sylvain: Me either… Of course, even if we did get it, what do we do about it?"
14642,"Choice 2: For the sake of her ideals?
Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
14643,"Sylvain: Ideals she believes in so much she was willing to start a war over them? Those must be some lofty ideals, to say the least."
14644,"Mercedes: I guess we have no choice but to fight, have we? Oh, but why would Edelgard do something like this? I'm sure we'll be all right though, Professor. The goddess will keep us safe."
14645,"Ingrid: To think that the Flame Emperor was Edelgard all along… Flayn's abduction, Jeralt's murder, the turmoil in Remire Village… Whether or not she was the mastermind behind what happened, it at least seems like she was involved. And yet she was able to remain so composed while she was enrolled at the Officer's Academy…"
14646,"Lorenz: The Empire's aggression cannot stand. But if we are going to attack them now, we must be honest with ourselves about our chances of success. It goes without saying that I will fight the Imperial army with everything I have, for as long as I am able. But House Gloucester's territory is adjacent to Imperial lands. Let us proceed with caution."
14647,"Raphael: I hear the Alliance's territory will be in danger if we don't get rid of these Empire guys! If the Alliance is in danger, that means my sister's in danger too! There's no way I'm gonna allow that. It doesn't matter how many guys they throw at us, I'll beat 'em all! These muscles aren't just for show! But first, I gotta get some food."
14648,"Ignatz: You know, Professor, I'm glad that I came to the Officers Academy. I feel accepted here. I've learned so much. Honestly, I'm surprised at how much I've grown. So, I will not let the academy be destroyed. It's important to me, and I will protect it!"
14649,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor.
Choice 2: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
14650,"Choice 1: I feel the same. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor."
14651,"Ignatz: I feel braver just hearing you say that, Professor."
14652,"Choice 2: Don't do anything rash.
Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
14653,"Ignatz: I'll try to keep a clear head, but there won't be any turning back for me. I don't want to have regrets."
14654,"Ignatz: We're gonna win this, Professor!"
14655,"Lysithea: So Edelgard, the one who calls herself the Flame Emperor, was connected to those strange beings. The Imperial army might be using even more terrifying methods than we know. You had better be cautious, Professor. Any amount of carelessness might prove to be our undoing."
14656,"Marianne: Can we really defeat someone who is willing to turn their back on the world just to uphold their own beliefs? I've spent my whole life running in fear, and now...I..."
14657,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?
Choice 2: We can't win if you run. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!"
14658,"Choice 1: We can win this together.
Marianne: Surely we can win if we rely on each other. Right, Professor?"

14661,Marianne: You're right. It's time to stop running. I'll fight with everything I've got!
14662,"Hilda: Professor, I guess it’s easy for me to say this now. I’m so glad I’m from the Alliance. I had no idea Edelgard was so scary! And Dimitri seems totally different than before… I wouldn’t bend a knee to either of them."
14663,"Byleth:
Choice 1: And how do you feel about Claude?
Hilda: Well, I definitely don’t hate him. He rarely takes things seriously, but somehow… I just know we can always rely on him. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Choice 2: You wouldn't accept them?
Hilda: I think it's the other way around. They wouldn't accept me."
14664,"Choice 1: And how do you feel about Claude?
Hilda: Well, I definitely don’t hate him. He rarely takes things seriously, but somehow… I just know we can always rely on him. (Relationship with Hilda up)"

Hilda: I think it's the other way around. They wouldn't accept me."
14667,Hilda: I think it's the other way around. They wouldn't accept me.
14668,"Hilda: Well, if we’re forced to protect this place, our future’s going to be dark no matter what."
14669,Leonie: What is Edelgard even trying to achieve? She wants to destroy the church so badly that she'll take on anyone who doesn't fall in line? I don't get it.
14670,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept."
14671,Choice 1: Her ideals are in conflict with yours. (Relationship with Leonie up)
14672,Choice 2: It's a hard thing to accept.
14673,"Leonie: I just can't believe she'd start a war over it. Not to mention using such nasty tactics to get her way. Could Captain Jeralt's death have also been a part of her plan? Don't you go and die on me, Professor. Captain Jeralt would never forgive you."
14674,"Rhea: How are you, Professor? Any new changes to report? With the Imperial army drawing near, it is most vexing that we cannot relax and converse as we once did... Thankfully, you have the divine protection of the goddess on your side. Please try to listen carefully for her voice…"
14675,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I will try. (Relationship with Rhea up)
Choice 2: I can't hear a thing.
Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time."
14676,Choice 1: I will try. (Relationship with Rhea up)
14677,"Choice 2: I can't hear a thing.
Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time."
14678,Rhea: Please do not say such sad things. I am certain you will hear her in time.
14679,Rhea: May the goddess's voice reach you…
14680,Seteth: We must protect Garreg Mach. Defiling the Holy Tomb was a sacrilege. I will not allow such a thing to happen again. The archbishop has already given you a new responsibility. I want you to rise to that honor.
14681,"Flayn: Professor… War is breaking out again, is it not?"
14682,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time.
Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?"
14683,"Choice 1: Again?
Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
14684,"Flayn: There was a truly terrible war, once upon a time."
14685,"Choice 2: I want to stop it if I can.
Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?"
14686,Flayn: An honorable notion. Do you think there is something to be done? Whatever shall we do?
14687,Flayn: I never wanted another war… All we can do is steel ourselves for the fight ahead.
14688,"Alois: Well, perhaps it's pointless to get upset about the past. My duty now is to prepare for battle. We're depending on your strength, Professor. Crush our enemies!"
14689,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'll try
Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)"
14690,Choice 1: I'll try
14691,Choice 2: I'm depending on you. (Relationship with Alois up)
14692,"Alois: Captain, I hope you're watching! We will protect Garreg Mach!"
14693,"Catherine: Ugh. If I could go back to last month and throttle my carefree self! Now it turns out Edelgard is the Flame Emperor, and the new Adrestian emperor! And she's striking out against the monastery, with the full force of the Imperial army behind her. We gotta beat her at her own game! For our sake as well as Lady Rhea's..."
14694,"Shamir: We're falling behind. I don't know that we can keep up with the new emperor. To think that she was able to raise an army of that size right under our noses... However hard we fight, I give us a 50 percent chance of winning. The enemy has too many advantages. We must make careful preparations."
14695,"Gilbert: There are always small power struggles, still… It has been hundreds of years since all of Fódlan was consumed by war. I didn't actually think it would come to this… I feel as though I'm not in my rightful place. I cannot protect the things I should… Professor. If I survive this war, I wish to return to my homeland… To the land of my kind."
14696,"Hanneman: The Holy Tomb held many Crest Stones. This is the first time I've heard of Crest Stones being hidden away in such a place… But more importantly, I'm interested to know the Empire's aim. Why would their army desire Crest Stones? There is power there, yes. And yet… I must think on this. The Crest Stones lie at the heart of the events surrounding Conand Tower and the chapel as well… And of course, the Crest Stones somehow transformed those traitors and their captives into Demonic Beasts… Could that possibly be their aim?! The Empire's army may well plan to use Crest Stones to create Demonic Beasts!"
14697,"Manuela: The mastermind behind the attacks on the monastery was Edelgard? Wow. Doesn't make much sense though, does it? There would need to be all sorts of territories and groups tangled up in this sort of mess… Eh, I'm gonna stop. I don't really have the head for this political stuff. Mostly I'm worried about my old opera company. I wonder what's happening in the capital right now. I hope they're safe…"
14698,"Cyril: It's my job to protect Lady Rhea. I've gotta do it. and I gotta do it as best I can. And if that means I gotta die for her, then I will. Ugh, how could Edelgard treat Lady Rhea like she's the bad guy? She's never been anything but nice to everybody! I just don't get it at all…"
14699,"Gatekeeper: Greetings Professor! Something to report! Unexpected, isn't it? Apparently, this is the first time Garreg Mach has been invaded in its whole 995-year history! It's my job to protect this gate, so even if enemies come in droves, I will never let them through! I hope we both survive… Let's battle with all our might and pray we win this thing!"
14700,"Knight of Seiros: I cannot believe our negligence allowed the Empire to invade. Edelgard probably gathered her soldiers in Garreg Mach, intending to do this from the start. Soldiers disguised as merchants and pilgrims to avoid suspicion…infiltration the entire area little by little. They couldn't be better prepared. We'll have a tough time winning this one, I'm afraid."
14701,Student: Professor! What actually happened last month? I can't keep up at all. Edelgard is the emperor? And she's declared war against the church? So now we're at war?! WHAT is going on? I really don't understand any of this… What should I do?
14702,"Student: I thought we'd all be really busy with assignments and getting ready for graduation. But now… Now that things have turned out like this, I guess there's nothing to do but fight…"
14703,Monk: Those who serve the church must cast aside all selfish desires and devote themselves fully to their beliefs. But is it right to wield piety as a weapon? I…have never considered such things before. The church… I… I have always done what I thought best to save the people of Fódlan…
14704,"Monk: How dare they threaten the goddess! Such a vile act cannot be forgiven! There is no need to worry, I promise you that. Divine punishment will surely fall upon them. In the days of yore, the goddess would grow angry with such insolent fools and roast them in Ailell…"
14705,"Yuri: So this is how it's turned out. I figured as much, but I didn't anticipate it would happen so soon. If Garreg Mach becomes a battlefield, Abyss will have no choice but to get involved. Everyone here will have no alternative. They've got nowhere else to go."
14706,"Balthus: I could smell a war brewing, and sure enough, here we are. Hmm... If Fódlan falls onto chaos, I wonder if my debts will fall away along with it... Heh, just thinking aloud here. If the Empire wants a fight, let's give 'em one to remember!"
14707,"It shakes me to my core that the Empire would lash out so violently. I shall have to reconsider my intended path towards restoring House Nuvelle. Still, I could not in good conscience fight without speaking to her first..."
14708,"Hapi: Lots of people in Abyss are already struggling to get by. War will make things even harder for us. We're sure to run out of food and other supplies, and there will probably be refugees to take care of. Not to mention what might happen if the Empire takes over and decides to redecorate."
14709,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Aww, guess who was worried about Abyss and came by to check on me. I mean, on us. Isn't that nice? That's just...so nice."
14710,Knight of Seiros: My pleasure. Surely the church can spare one knight to help you watch over this place.
14711,"Abysskeeper: I'm not crying! I'm just...just don't worry about it, OK?! Move it along!"
14712,"Magic Wielder: This might be our last chance to get out of here. I'm leaving Garreg Mach. You should too. Protect the students? Have you got a death wish?! All right, all right. Uh, take this... and try not to get killed."
14713,"Rogue: War's actually coming, isn't it? Unbelievable. Imperial troops in Garreg Mach? It's gonna be wild. Whatever happens won't affect us down here in Abyss, though... Will it?"
14714,"Seteth: We have been scouting the makeup of the Imperial army, but much is still unclear. Any information you could provide would be a great help"
14715,"Seteth: Interesting… It's true that a lot more people have been coming and going as of late. Hmm, perhaps we could secure new information if we capture someone from the Imperial army. Thank you. That is quite helpful."
14716,"Alois: Listen up, everyone! The Imperial army is upon us. If you can fight, pick up a weapon! Everyone else, hurry up and evacuate! We have the goddess's protection on our side. We have nothing to fear. Victory will be ours!"
14717,"Catherine: Professor, are you ready?"
14718,"(The player chooses ""Almost."")"
14719,"Catherine: Well, hurry up. I don't need to tell you that the situation is dire. We have some support troops from the local nobles, but the army we're facing is immense. No matter how you look at it, we're at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, the enemy is being led by Edelgard. Do not underestimate how extraordinary her abilities are."
14720,Hilda: She's back already? Talk about impatient!
14721,"Claude: If we don't stop them, the academy will be destroyed. Prepare for battle, everyone!"
14722,Lysithea: We will stop Edelgard's rampage!
14723,"Ignatz: Our opponent is formidable, but if we work together, we will not fail."
14724,Raphael: Enough talking! Let's go!
14725,"Marianne: Dear Goddess… Please, protect us all…"
14726,Flayn: I shall fight with all that I have. It is an honor to fight alongside each of you!
14727,"Hilda: Professor, Claude… You'll lead the way, won't you? You won't let any of us fall, right?"
14728,"Claude: I wanted to talk to Rhea first, but as expected, that won't be possible. What did she hope to accomplish at the Holy Tomb? What happened to you as a baby? There are still so many things I need to know. The same goes for the real origin of the Crest Stones and the Heroes' Relics. As for Seiros and Nemesis…just how much of their mythology is true?"
14729,"Claude: It's true. But lucky for me, I refuse to die with so much still unknown. Hey, Teach… All joking aside. Can we possibly survive this battle?"
14730,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll find a way.
Claude: That's all we can do, right? If we gave up, the god of fate wouldn't be happy.
Choice 2: I don't know.
Claude: Hey, now! I wasn't really looking for an honest answer. Honesty is bad for morale, Teach. You'd better cut that out."
14731,"Choice 1: We'll find a way.
Claude: That's all we can do, right? If we gave up, the god of fate wouldn't be happy."
14732,"Claude: That's all we can do, right? If we gave up, the god of fate wouldn't be happy."
14733,"Choice 2: I don't know.
Claude: Hey, now! I wasn't really looking for an honest answer. Honesty is bad for morale, Teach. You'd better cut that out."
14734,"Claude: Hey, now! I wasn't really looking for an honest answer. Honesty is bad for morale, Teach. You'd better cut that out."
14735,"Claude: I'm a lot of things, but I'm not the kind of man to just roll over and die in a place like this. I have my own ambitions to see to. There are things…dreams…that I must see come to fruition. And I've been thinking. I want you to see those dreams realized as well. On top of all that, there are still so many secrets out there, just waiting to be uncovered. We can't let that stand, can we? So, Teach… No, scratch that. You're so much more. You're my ally and my friend. Teach… Friend… None of those words quite capture what you've come to mean to me. We may not be connected by blood, but I believe our bond goes deeper than that. Now that we know each other, our hearts are connected. Even if our paths diverge and we're forced to say good-bye… I know that we'll meet again. And so, for lack of a better word, I gratefully call you my friend, and I hold fast to the belief that this isn't it for us. No matter who or what you really are, I'll always be on your side. You can't count on much in this world, but you can count on that."

14738,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth or Claude falls in battle (classic mode), all of your units fall in battle (casual mode), Rhea falls in battle, or the defended location is captured."
14739,Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The enemy is within the walls. They're about to break the defensive line!
14740,"Claude: We have two priorities for this battle. Protect the archbishop, and maintain the defensive line!"
14741,"Claude: Reinforcements should arrive soon, so just hold your ground until then!"
14742,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has taken the entrances there the reinforcements were heading!
14743,"Claude: So long as we can recapture the east and west strongholds, we might be able to call in the reinforcements..."
14744,Claude: We took back one of the strongholds. On to the next…
14745,"Claude: All right, we took back both of the strongholds. Let's keep up the momentum!"
14746,"Catherine: I'm here, and I've brought reinforcements! Don't worry--we'll protect the monastery! (if Catherine was not recruited)"
14747,Shamir: I brought reinforcements. I'll send them to the front line. (if Shamir was not recruited)
14748,Claude:Damn it... The monastery has fallen into the hands of our enemy. We failed.
14749,Rhea: The goddess protects us... what is there to fear rebel swords... This is blasphemy against the goddess! Stop this now!
14750,Rhea: N-no... I cannot fall here...
14751,Randolph: A wonderful chance to earn some recognition! I'll be the one to take down the monastery!
14752,Caspar: Huh. This guy seems real familiar…
14753,Randolph: Y-you dastard! Aren't you… No…
14754,"Caspar: Eh, that doesn't matter right now. Let's go!"
14755,Randolph: I have no choice but to distinguish myself in this fight!
14756,"Randolph: Argh! I'm finished. I'm loathe to say it, but I must retreat..."
14757,Hubert: Lady Edelgard held you in such high esteem.
14758,"Hubert: In the end, however, it seems like you are nothing more than a slave to your goddess."
14759,"Hubert: Such a shame. There are people in the Empire you truly care about, too, aren't there? I wonder what will become of them."
14760,"Hubert: What you fail to appreciate is that we have, at our backs, a force you cannot hope to defeat."
14761,Hubert: I can afford to fall back. We still have the advantage.
14762,Death Knight: This battlefield is too chaotic... for us to kill each other upon…
14763,Death Knight: This fight is but a sideshow… to the ravaging of the sacred place that is Garreg Mach…
14764,Death Knight: The time is not right... I will wait for the next opportunity…
14765,Ladislava: I will not allow you to get any closer to Her Majesty!
14766,"Ladislava: My life was changed forever by Her Majesty... Now, I lay it on the line. For the Empire!"
14767,"Ladislava: Lady Edelgard, I'm so sorry! I can't keep going! I must retreat!"
14768,"Edelgard: I wish you were someone whose heart could be swayed by my words and deeds. If it were so, I would have done anything to make you my ally…"
14769,Claude: Here she is - Her Majesty - looking pleased as a dog with a stick. What exactly happened to make you this way?
14770,Edelgard: I'm simply seeing through a promise I made to myself a long time ago.
14771,"Claude: Isn't this much force excessive? Thanks to you, my own long-held ambitions are nearly destroyed."
14772,"Edelgard: If you don't want them to be destroyed completely, I suggest you turn tail and flee."
14773,"Edelgard: So, House Nuvelle has chosen the path that will lead to its ultimate demise. How pitiable."
14774,"Constance: As you say, I have forfeited my claim on being a noble of the Empire. That is why you must permit me to challenge you in combat, that I may establish a new House Nuvelle."
14775,Edelgard: As you wish. Let's see if your resolve is a match for my own.
14776,"Edelgard: Think very carefully about whether you wish to raise your sword against the Empire... or if you will offer it to us in fealty. And after you've thought it through, if you still wish to fight, I won't stop you. I will simply use the full extent of my power… and crush you."
14777,Edelgard: You will come to regret raising your blade against the emperor of the Adrestian Empire!
14778,"Edelgard: You fought well. But now, your fight is over. Send in our reserve troops, and give my uncle the signal!"
14779,Rhea: What… is this?!
14780,"Rhea: Everyone here, young and old, is in your hands."
14781,Rhea: No. I will not allow another Red Canyon tragedy to happen here.

14788,"It is Imperial Year 1185. Nearly five years have passed since the fall of the monastery at Garreg Mach, and war continues to plague the lands of Fódlan. Fhirdiad has been captured. The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is in shambles. The Leicester Alliance is on the verge of collapse, fractured by two opposing factions–those who support the Adrestian Empire and its ruler, and those who seek her demise. Meanwhile, under Emperor Edelgard’s rule of law, the Adrestian Empire continues to expand its reach. The path to a new Fódlan, unified by Imperial strength, may yet be in sight.

14791,"In the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, Imperialist loyalist Cornelia has subdued all regions of the former royal house of Blaiddyd to prevent further revolt. Prince Dimitri has been sentenced. Now, the backbone of the former Kingdom–Houses Gautier and Fraldarius–struggle to continue the resistance. Cornelia–operating out of the royal palace–has accepted the support of the Empire to build an army and plots to wipe out all remaining Kingdom forces.
"
14792,"In the Leicester Alliance, House Riegan leads an anti-Imperial faction, while House Gloucester directs the Empire’s supporters. Despite the undeniable threat of fracture, the Alliance’s adept new leader, Claude, deftly maintains the outward appearance of a unified front.
"
14793,"In Enbarr, the Imperial Capital of the Adrestian Empire, Emperor Edelgard fights to strengthen her regime. She has extended her reach to the Kingdom by inciting a coup and continues to draw its former lords under her influence in pursuit of controlling all of western Fódlan.
"
14794,"In the meantime, the Knights of Seiros have been dispatched to find Archbishop Rhea, who remains missing despite their searching. Left unattended, the monastery at Garreg Mach has fallen to ruin…and become a haven for thieves.

14838,"Claude: I guess it's on me to catch you up. As you can see, Garreg Mach was crushed by the Empire and was never restored. The monastery is in ruins, and the town is in pretty bad shape too. Can you guess why?"
14839,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Rhea has been sleeping too?
Claude: Huh. It would seem that's one possible explanation, since you insist that's what you've been up to.
Choice 2: Rhea has died?
Claude: Her body was never found, and the Empire never declared that she had been killed. So… No telling."
14840,"Choice 1: Rhea has been sleeping too?
Claude: Huh. It would seem that's one possible explanation, since you insist that's what you've been up to."
14841,"Claude: Huh. It would seem that's one possible explanation, since you insist that's what you've been up to."
14842,"Choice 2: Rhea has died?
Claude: Her body was never found, and the Empire never declared that she had been killed. So… No telling."
14843,"Claude: Her body was never found, and the Empire never declared that she had been killed. So… No telling."
14844,Claude: All we know for sure is that Rhea suddenly vanished during that battle five years ago. The Knights of Seiros have apparently been searching all over Fódlan for her… But the fact that this place is still in ruins tells me they still haven't found her.
14845,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We must find her.
Claude: True. I've got a mountain of questions I'd like to ask her, after all.
Choice 2: I'm worried.
Claude: Worried, huh? Well, for better or worse, Rhea was clearly fond of you."
14846,"Choice 1: We must find her.
Claude: True. I've got a mountain of questions I'd like to ask her, after all."
14847,"Claude: True. I've got a mountain of questions I'd like to ask her, after all."

Claude: Worried, huh? Well, for better or worse, Rhea was clearly fond of you."
14849,"Claude: Worried, huh? Well, for better or worse, Rhea was clearly fond of you."
14850,"Claude: But I'm not so sure whether it would be good for her to return as the archbishop… Rather, with her gone… Eh, never mind. This could be a dangerous conversation. Before we discuss the state of affairs in each territory… Are you hungry? You must be. It's not much, but I did bring some food with me. Let's eat up and go from there."
14851,"Claude: Phew! I. Am. Stuffed. Even the most humble of meals tastes great with the right company. By the way, Teach, do you remember the night before the ball? I know it was five years ago… But we promised that the Golden Deer House would reunite during the millennium festival. Today's the day we promised to meet up… but no one's here."
14852,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's still early.
Claude: True… There's still some daylight left.
Choice 2: They must not like us.
Claude: Heh, you know everyone looked up to you, right? Or is this your way of telling me I was a lousy house leader?"
14853,"Choice 1: It's still early.
Claude: True… There's still some daylight left."
14854,Claude: True… There's still some daylight left.
14855,"Choice 2: They must not like us.
Claude: Heh, you know everyone looked up to you, right? Or is this your way of telling me I was a lousy house leader?"
14856,"Claude: Heh, you know everyone looked up to you, right? Or is this your way of telling me I was a lousy house leader?"
14857,"Claude: Let's just wait a little longer. You never know… Maybe someone will show up after all. Hey, Teach… Just waiting around sounds boring, so why don't we get in some exercise. You know, help with digestion and stuff. You must be in bad shape if you've been sleeping for five years. It'll do you good to get your body moving again."
14858,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You want to work out?
Choice 2: You want to play a game?"
14859,Choice 1: You want to work out?
14860,Choice 2: You want to play a game?
14861,"Claude: Something like that. Look, if you come with me, you'll understand. Oh, and don't forget your weapons, OK? I want to make sure neither your leadership nor your skill with a blade have dulled."

14866,Claude: The thieves are here. Apparently they're trying to run off with treasures from the monastery.
14867,Pallardó: What the… Intruders! Protect the goods!
14868,Claude: This is gonna get expensive. Collect everything the thieves carried out!
14869,"Lorenz: The barbarity is even worse than the rumors. On my honor as a noble, I will expel these ruffians!"
14870,"Ignatz: Today was supposed to be a happy day, but the monastery is in disrepair..."
14871,Hilda: Over there… Is that the professor? And the others?!
14872,"Leonie: Professor! You're alive! Guess we'd better handle this before I celebrate though, huh?"
14873,Claude: You finally made it! I guess virtue still exists in this crazy world after all.
14874,"Raphael: Is that the professor and everyone else? If they're fighting, I gotta go help!"
14875,"Lysithea: Wow, it's you! Here I thought you were dead all this time."
14876,Marianne: Could that be the Professor's…ghost?
14877,"Claude: Hey, you're late! Hurry up and help!"
14878,"Claude: Hm, we could split into two groups. If we hit them from the north and south, we can trap their leader in a pincer attack."
14879,Hilda: Professor! Boy am I glad to see you. How did we end up in this situation?
14880,"Ignatz: Professor, it's been too long! I do want to chat, but first let's handle these criminals."
14881,Leonie: You've been alive all this time?! Where have you been hiding?! Never mind - talk later!
14882,"Lorenz: We have much to discuss. But first, let us dispense with the riffraff. It is a noble's duty, after all!"
14883,"Lysithea: Ugh. The instant we arrive, we're neck deep in battle. We should've arrived late."
14884,Marianne: P-Professor? Is it really you?
14885,"Raphael: Is that really you, Professor? It's been so long! I thought I'd never see you again!"
14886,Pallardó: No! I'm not the one you want! Gah! I guess I've got no choice.
14887,Pallardó: It isn't looking good for us. Should we retreat?
14888,"Claude: So, he revealed his true identity. Catch him and recover the treasure!"
14889,"Pallardó: Ah, you should yield me a tidy profit!"
14890,Pallardó: I have no longer any reason to be here. Good-bye and be well!
14891,"Claude: Well, he got away with the treasure... But hey, at least you got the rust off. Right, Teach?"
14892,Pallardó: I thought it would be easy money… Maybe it wasn't…meant to be…
14893,"Claude: We took care of that. Are you sufficiently warmed up, Teach?"
14894,"Hilda: Ugh, I'm exhausted! What gives, Professor?"
14895,"Lysithea: I was so excited to see everyone again, and then this happens…"
14896,Leonie: I'm still tired from the long journey. How did it come to this?
14897,Ignatz: Let's all take a moment to catch our breath…
14898,"Hilda: If you've got the time to play with those guys, the least you could do is prepare some tea."
14899,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thanks for your help.
Claude: We were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits.
Choice 2: Blame Claude.
Claude: Come on, those guys were thieves! We couldn't just let them get away."
14900,"Choice 1: Thanks for your help.
Claude: We were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits."
14901,Claude: We were hoping someone would come to back us up when we started routing the bandits.
14902,"Choice 2: Blame Claude.
Claude: Come on, those guys were thieves! We couldn't just let them get away."
14903,"Claude: Come on, those guys were thieves! We couldn't just let them get away."
14904,Claude: It seems they've been taking advantage of the church's absence and doing whatever they please here.
14905,"Marianne: In any case, um… I'm glad that all of you are well."
14906,"Ignatz: That's the spirit, Marianne!"
14907,"Raphael: That was fun! In fact, I wouldn't mind romping around some more!"
14908,"Lorenz: So, you were alive this whole time, Professor. I am not surprised. In fact, that is why I came here."
14909,Leonie: And it doesn't look like time has rusted your skills. That's a relief!
14910,"Claude: I'm just glad everyone's alive and well. On that note, let's move this reunion party somewhere else."
14911,"Claude: Now that we've dealt with those violent bandits, we could potentially use this place as our base of operations again."
14912,Hilda: What could you possibly mean by that?
14913,"Claude: I'm talking about the Leicester Alliance taking over Garreg Mach Monastery. After all, it's right in the middle of Fódlan. It's a critical strategic location."
14914,Lysithea: Are you suggesting that we fight back against the Empire?
14915,Lorenz: Aren't you getting a bit ahead of yourself? The Alliance is in complete discord at present.
14916,"Claude: And as leader of the Imperial faction of the Alliance, isn't Count Gloucester, your father, the main cause of that discord?"
14917,"Lorenz: I… Yes, that is true. It was inevitable. Our house's territory is close to Imperial land, after all. Had we not consented to vassalage under the Empire, they would have invaded immediately."
14918,"Claude: Naturally. And to be clear, I have no problem with your house maintaining its Imperial ties until we're sufficiently prepared to revolt. The Empire is the cause of the infighting. If we rid ourselves of them, the situation should resolve itself. That's why I'm thinking we should make this our base, raise up an army, and stir up some trouble for the Empire."
14919,Raphael: Now you're talking! Sounds like fun!
14920,"Hilda: So then, Mr. Leader Man. Does this mean you intend to rope us into your little scheme?"
14921,Byleth: Leader Man?
14922,Claude: Hm? Ah. My grandfather passed away. That means yours truly is officially the leader of the Alliance.
14923,"Lorenz: If we had a more reliable leader, perhaps the Alliance would not have been divided…"
14924,Claude: Think what you will. All I need to know is if you're in or you're out.
14925,Leonie: I'm happy to lend a hand. I won't let those Imperial dogs set foot in Alliance territory! I couldn't bear it if my village got caught up in the chaos of war.
14926,Raphael: I'll fight too! I've gotta protect my little sis!
14927,"Lysithea: I will join as well. After all, House Ordelia was once dragged into an Imperial revolt. It ruined us."
14928,"Lorenz: Ah, of course. I understand your motivation."
14929,Ignatz: I'll fight too… It's time to take responsibility for my own future!
14930,Marianne: I… I don't want to run anymore. I hope I'll be of use to everyone…
14931,"Ignatz: We can do anything if we work together, Marianne!"
14932,"Hilda: What about you, Lorenz? Are you going to go back home to your scary father or what?"
14933,"Lorenz: We cannot rely on Claude's scheming to lead us to victory. Therefore, I will remain. It is my duty to ensure Claude does not worsen the situation in the Alliance."
14934,"Claude: All of us are fighting for a different reason, but we share a common enemy. If we don't act, the Empire will crush us eventually. I say we stop them before they have the chance! So, Teach… Will you help as well?"
14935,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'd rather search for Rhea than fight.
Claude: All the more reason to join us. Admit it. You're not going to be able to do much on your own.
Choice 2: I'll give it some thought.
Claude: Please do. I'm counting on you. Even if your ultimate goal is to find Rhea, it would be better to stick with us as you search."
14936,"Choice 1: I'd rather search for Rhea than fight.
Claude: All the more reason to join us. Admit it. You're not going to be able to do much on your own."
14937,Claude: All the more reason to join us. Admit it. You're not going to be able to do much on your own.
14938,"Choice 2: I'll give it some thought.
Claude: Please do. I'm counting on you. Even if your ultimate goal is to find Rhea, it would be better to stick with us as you search."
14939,"Claude: Please do. I'm counting on you. Even if your ultimate goal is to find Rhea, it would be better to stick with us as you search."
14940,"Claude: With you on our side, the church will join us as well. That makes fighting the Empire a moral cause, which means it will be easier to rally support. Above all, your knowledge and strength are indispensable if we hope to stand a chance against the Imperial army. Without you, my schemes are nothing. Just words. Please… Take all of that into consideration as you decide."
14941,"Hilda: You're really laying it all on the table, aren't you, Claude? Well, all that aside, this place is a mess. We can't very well make our base in a ruin! And repairing it sounds like a lot of work… I wonder if anyone would be willing to help us out with that?"
14942,Seteth: Can it be?! You were alive all this time?!
14943,Flayn: Professor! It is so good to see you again. My brother and I were worried about you.
14944,"Alois: Ah, thank the goddess… I couldn't bear the thought of letting Jeralt down by not finding you."
14945,Shamir: Guess you lucked out.
14946,Catherine: We've been looking everywhere for you! But…I see Lady Rhea isn't with you. Damn.
14947,"Cyril: Everyone was real worried about you, Professor."
14948,"Claude: Cyril? Is that you? You've grown up, kid. Have you been looking for Rhea with the knights?"
14949,"Cyril: Of course. Without Lady Rhea, I don't belong anywhere."
14950,"Claude: Cyril, that's not… Never mind. We'll figure it all out."
14951,"Manuela: Oh my, the Golden Deer House is together again at last. And all grown up! Well, for the most part."
14952,Hanneman: I do regret that we were never able to hold a proper graduation for all of you students.
14953,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why are you here?
Choice 2: How is the search for Rhea progressing?"
14954,Choice 1: Why are you here?
14955,Choice 2: How is the search for Rhea progressing?
14956,"Seteth: It has been five years since Lady Rhea disappeared. We have devoted all of our energies to finding her. However, without being able to set foot in Empire territory, we are at a standstill. We had hoped that perhaps the archbishop would return here on this day…that of the long-awaited millennium festival."
14957,"Claude: Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case. Though, I don't suppose you had very high hopes in that regard. Even if she were able to return here, with the monastery in ruins, I don't think she would have felt safe enough to do so. Right, Hilda?"
14958,Hilda: Yeah. This is an important location for the church. To think you've left it in such a state!
14959,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The believers are mourning this destruction.
Choice 2: It's a danger to the locals too."
14960,Choice 1: The believers are mourning this destruction.
14961,Choice 2: It's a danger to the locals too.
14962,Alois: That's true… Perhaps we've left it alone for too long. We've got to make things right!
14963,Cyril: I can clean this place up like new! It's not fit for Lady Rhea like this.
14964,Catherine: And leaving this place in ruins affects the safety of this area too.
14965,Hanneman: Agreed. There is also a great deal of valuable literature here.
14966,"Ignatz: Then let's do it! If we all work together, we can restore the monastery to its original beauty!"
14967,Seteth: We will require the aid of skilled craftsmen too. I shall seek out any such individuals who are willing to return to Garreg Mach.
14968,Hilda: Fantastic! I'll figure out how to split up the work and then we can get started!

14980,"Claude: Good work, Hilda! You didn't do much manual labor, but you managed to rope the knights into helping us restore the monastery."
14981,"Hilda: Thanks, Claude, but all I did was piggyback on your scheme. I saw your eyes telling me to make some magic happen!"
14982,Alois: Thank you so much for your help with the restoration.
14983,"Hilda: Oh please, it was nothing! We're just doing our part as former students."
14984,Catherine: I'm told you even routed the bandits. That job should have fallen to us. I'm sorry for the trouble.
14985,"Claude: Hey, don't think twice about it. We're all allies in the resistance against the Empire, right?"
14986,"Catherine: The church is at war with the Empire, but let's be realistic. Wouldn't it be better for the Alliance to eventually submit?"
14987,"Claude: The way I see it, the emperor wants to take over all of Fódlan and destroy the existing order of the world. I can't see her allowing the Alliance to continue to exist. We're in this just as deeply as you are. Actually… We were hoping to use this place as a base. The Empire begs to be meddled with, and we're first in line."
14988,Alois: What? Why would you want to make your base here of all places?
14989,"Claude: Garreg Mach is situated in the center of Fódlan, both geographically and spiritually. We want to secure this location while the Empire is still overlooking it."
14990,Catherine: I see. The Empire doesn't see this place as important at the moment because it's far from the front lines.
14991,"Claude: But if we simply decide that it's ours to occupy, that does nothing to inspire the hearts and minds of the people of Fódlan. Luckily, good ol' Teach has finally returned to us. If the Professor Rhea entrusted with the Sword of the Creator fights at our side… Well now. That's a just cause anyone could get behind. What's more, here we are, working alongside the legendary Knights of Seiros. It smacks of divine providence, doesn't it? Can you feel it?"
14992,"Seteth: I have heard what you have to say, Claude. And you, Professor? Where do you stand?"
14993,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I will fight the Empire.
Seteth: Hm. On our own, we lack sufficient military strength. But with the help of the Alliance…
Choice 2: I will find Rhea.
Seteth: Hm. We are at a relative standstill, but with the help of the Alliance…"

14997,"Seteth: Hm. We are at a relative standstill, but with the help of the Alliance…"
14998,"Seteth: The archbishop said if anything should happen to her, that we should entrust the affairs of the church to you. If you intend to fight alongside the Alliance, then I will follow you as well. Is that acceptable, Claude?"
14999,"Claude: Of course. I can't think of anything more reassuring than having both Teach and the knights on our side. Together, we'll stop the emperor and her reckless ambitions!"
15000,"Claude: Hey there, my friend. It's funny how the monastery was once in ruins, but now it's downright bustling. Thanks to a little promise five years ago, our buddies have all gathered, and even the knights have returned. It's like we were all just waiting for you to awaken. And now we're all going to band together against the Imperial army. You should go and talk to everyone, if you can. There may be some who are still on the fence."
15001,"Lorenz: I have written to my father to signal my intention to remain here. Not that I require his approval to do so. There is not much for me to gain by returning to Alliance territory now. But by staying, I will be able to influence the course of events directly, on the field of battle."
15002,"Byleth:

I kinda figured I was gonna be stuck going back and taking over for her. But thanks to you and Claude, I get to work on my dream of becoming a proper knight!"
15008,"Ignatz: It's been fixed up quite a bit, but it's battle scars aren't so easily erased... To think that a glorious cathedral, with a thousand year history... would end up like this.

15022,"Leonie: It's not just for my village that I'm fighting alongside you here, you know. It's also that Captain Jeralt asked me, his first and greatest apprentice, to look out for you. Of course, it wouldn't be enough just to keep you alive. It's my duty to make sure you win too. So do your best, Professor. And count on me to watch your back."
15023,"Ferdinand: I have lost my dominion. My nobility may seem like nothing more than a title. But I will never lose my noble heart. I will stop Edelgard, even if it costs me my life.

15028,"Linhardt: The promise was made five years ago, but I must say I'm rather surprised how many of us managed to make it. Personally, I only showed up because I hoped to see you again, Professor. I've been with my family in the Empire until recently. I admit to feeling a little guilty betraying Her Majesty...but only a little. Now that we're all together again, I suppose the fighting will begin soon."
15029,"Caspar: Hey, Professor! You won't believe what happened! I figured I couldn't go back to the Empire after Garreg Mach fell, so I started drifting across the Kingdom and Alliance. Then, I just happened to run into our old class, so we came back to the monastery together!"
15030,"Bernadetta: Ah, at last, I return to my domain! My lonely paradise! My realm of exquisite Solitude! Huh? Professor? Is that, um. Is that you? You, um. You didn't hear that just now, did you?"

15034,"Choice 2: Hear What? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good."
15035,"Bernadetta: Right. You didn't? Well, um. Good."
15036,"Dorothea: Laaa-la-laaa-la-laaa... Professor! Oh my! It's so good to see you. These days, so many old friends seem to be disappearing. But you... You're here! It's incredible to see you again after five years! I have a feeling your name will go down in history."
15037,"Petra: Edelgard is controlling the Empire. She is putting the pressure on the Kingdom and Alliance. Empire and religion are at open war. It will be… difficult for us at first. But corrupt nobles are many. That means the common people will rebel and be joining our side. With you, Professor, the battle tides will…ah, will turn. I have certainty."
15038,"Felix: A country with no king has no future. That's why I made my way here. Professor, don't let me down."
15039,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.
Choice 2: Let's forge ahead. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle and I'll be content."
15040,"Choice 1: Country with no king?
Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough."
15041,Felix: Hmph. You'll understand soon enough.

15043,"Felix: Yes, let's. Find me a worthy opponent to battle and I'll be content."
15044,"Sylvain: I'm the heir of House Gautier, and I'm fighting alongside a bunch of Alliance people? I can just imagine my father's face contorted in anger and the delightful words he must have used to describe me. I don't know how standing and fighting for Faerghus would have helped. Sorry, Professor. I don't regret my decisions. I'm just thinking out loud. And I'm hoping I haven't made a big mistake."
15045,"Mercedes: You're here, Professor, along with everyone from our old class. It's like we've gone back in time! When I think that I'll be around you again, all of my sorrows just drift away."
15046,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing...It sounds like the Kingdom and Empire have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!
Choice 2: Let's do our best together.
Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back."
15047,"Choice 1: Frankly, I don't feel too happy.
Mercedes: Hmm, I understand. Especially with Lady Rhea missing...It sounds like the Kingdom and Empire have been in a sorry state too. But we can't let that get us down!"

Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back."
15050,"Mercedes: Hmm, yes. I'll at least try not to hold anyone back."
15051,"Mercedes: Let's work together for the common good, like we did five years ago!"
15052,"Annette: Members of the knights tell me that Father left their ranks five years ago. They say he announced he was returning to the Kingdom, but nobody’s heard from him since. I haven’t received word that he went back to Mother… Where could he be… Where are you, Father…"
15053,"Ingrid: Professor. I have a proposal. Why not go beyond the Knights of Seiros—instead, uniting with allies from all across Fódlan to fight for our cause? Looking back, it would have been best to ally with the Kingdom and join forces against the Empire. But now the Kingdom is not exactly… Well…"
15054,"Seteth: Five long years, I've searched for you and the archbishop. It's a pleasure to see you again. The Church of Seiros will follow you from now on, but please do not abandon the search for Lady Rhea."
15055,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: Thank you. I know the battles ahead will be dire, but we will support you with all our strength.
Choice 2: We don't know what the future will bring.
Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down."
15056,"Choice 1: We'll do whatever it takes to find her. (Relationship with Seteth up)

15059,"Seteth: Wherever she is, Rhea is doubtlessly waiting for you. Please do not let her down."
15060,"Flayn: Professor, I am so glad you are unharmed! No matter the path you walk, I will be with you every step of the way. Anything you ask of me, I shall see it through. You saved my life, and I am in your debt."
15061,"Hanneman: Thankfully, it appears the records and equipment I need for my research have not been damaged. I am most curious though. You say you were asleep for five whole years? Incredible. Perhaps this is another effect of your Crest. I do look forward to investigating you in greater detail."
15062,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course.
Choice 2: Uh, maybe later...
Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
15063,"Choice 1: We can talk about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Wonderful news! I am most excited to begin. We must find the time, of course."

15066,"Hanneman: I'll have to be content with observing you wherever you go, then. I cannot waste any opportunity!"
15067,"Manuela: My, Professor. You haven't changed a bit! At your age, I'd expect your whole demeanor to have changed greatly over five years... Though I suppose I haven't changed either, right? Thank you for noticing, by the way. Ah, Just the two of us, forever young. Oh, let me have my fun."
15068,"Alois: I'd given up on ever seeing you again. Where have you been hiding? Anyway, now that we're reunited in the land of the living, I must fulfill my promise!"
15069,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain! to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold...
Choice 2: Right, the Promise. (Relationship with Alois up)
Alois: That's right! I promised the captain I'd protect you in his stead, and now I'll make good on my word!"
15070,"Choice 1: What promise?
Alois: The promise I made to the captain! to keep you safe! I can't believe you've forgotten. How cold..."

15074,"Catherine: In Lady Rhea's absence, I will follow you. That's what she would want me to do. Know that wherever you might lead us, I'll continue searching for Lady Rhea."
15075,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's fine. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor.
Choice 2: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
15076,"Choice 1: That's fine. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: Good, because I will not budge on that point. Welcome back, Professor."

15078,"Choice 2: Sounds like a lot of trouble.
Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
15079,"Catherine: I don't care how much trouble it is! I will rescue Lady Rhea, at all costs."
15080,Shamir: I'm more of a mercenary than a knight these days. I work to get paid. I never was too attached to Fódlan. I was considering leaving soon... But I might change my mind if you're around.
15081,"Cyril: I don't know anything about rebuilding, but I can sure do my best to clean up the mess. I'm gonna keep Lady Rhea's room spotless, so she can use it right away whenever she gets back. You gotta find her, Professor. You just gotta."
15082,"Anna: There's unrest everywhere these days. All of my fellow merchants seem to be endangered. I hope things go back to normal soon. People need more to smile about, aside from my great deals."
15083,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! You know, it's such a thrill to be able to greet you like this again! I almost died as well in the battle five years ago, but I won't allow any enemies to get into this place again, I promise you that! Even if the Death Knight shows up, I'll be sure to... Well, for now I'll keep training so I can eventually feel confident that I can stop him!"
15084,"Knight of Seiros: It seems that in the last five years, the monks here have left this place for the town below. However, once they learn of our return, perhaps they'll come back. I hope the monastery can return to normal some day..."
15085,"Knight of Seiros: During the millennium festival, the leaders of all territories were supposed to gather together and pledge perpetual peace. But now that hope has been dashed, thanks to the emperor's actions. The Kingdom is also vastly different than before. I guess we'll never return to the world as it was five years ago..."
15086,"Knight of Seiros: During his search for Her Grace, the archbishop, Seteth has visited churches all across the land. It served to demonstrate to the devout across Fódlan that the Church of Seiros is still going strong. As a result, the faithful are not currently in a state of chaos."
15087,"Soldier: In the Alliance, the lords have been at odds, so peace and prosperity have declined there as well. In particular, bandits have been appearing in large numbers near the Great Bridge of Myrddin. Rumor has it that the domain's lord, someone by the name of Acheron, is a completely ineffectual leader..."
15088,"Yuri: Well, hello. It's been a while, hasn't it? Are you really so surprised to see me here? I flew here just as soon as I heard you were alive. I care more than you may realize."
15089,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm happy you came. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: (blushing) Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make my heart flutter a bit.
Choice 2: There's so much to be done. Let's work together.
Yuri: Yes. Let's."
15090,"Choice 1: I'm happy you came. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: (blushing) Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make my heart flutter a bit."
15091,"Yuri: (blushing) Are you now? I will admit, hearing that does make my heart flutter a bit."
15092,"Choice 2: There's so much to be done. Let's work together.
Yuri: Yes. Let's."
15093,Yuri: Yes. Let's.
15094,"Yuri: So long as our efforts are aligned, I'll happily work alongside you."
15095,"Balthus: These past five years have been so chaotic, even the bounty hunters have backed off. I kinda miss the chase. I don't have family ties worth fighting for, so these muscles are up for grabs. Use me as you see fit, pal."
15096,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and I'll smash it up for ya.
Choice 2: I'm not sure about your motivation…
Balthus: By that, you mean ""Thank you, Magnanimous King of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome."
15097,"Choice 1: I'm counting on you. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You're a smart one. Just point me at a problem and I'll smash it up for ya."

15100,"Balthus: By that, you mean ""Thank you, Magnanimous King of Grappling!"" Yeah? Well, you're welcome."
15101,"Balthus: If you're worried my skills have dulled from disuse, think again. I've been fighting thieves to stay sharp."
15102,"Constance: Ahaha! You have the look of someone relieved to see me. Before you ask, yes. My superior spellcraft is yours. It's your reward for waiting so patiently for me."
15103,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you sure?
Choice 2: It would help me a lot. (Relationship with Constance up)"
15104,Choice 1: Are you sure?
15105,Choice 2: It would help me a lot. (Relationship with Constance up)
15106,"Constance: I'm sure that you need me, and that is enough. I recommend that you accept my generous offer."
15107,Constance: But my assistance has a price. I expect you to aid me in fulfilling my dream of restoring House Nuvelle.
15108,"Hapi: You're back, finally! I've been waiting for so long. I thought you might have died. But I didn't have anywhere else to go, so…I stayed here."
15109,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
15110,"Choice 1: Sorry to keep you waiting. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you."
15111,Hapi: I'll think about forgiving you.
15112,"Choice 2: Thanks for sticking around.
Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy."
15113,Hapi: You're welcome. It wasn't easy.
15114,"Hapi: I've been kinda lonely. As you might have noticed, we've lost a few people down here."
15115,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. It's you. You're still alive! It's been five whole years, hasn't it? Time flies when you're standing guard. That's right. I've been here the whole time. Day in and day out. not like I have anywhere else to be. Looks like the Knights of Seiros have returned. I wonder if Mr. Backup is back too…"
15116,Rogue: A lot of folks cleared out once the fighting started. People are saying it was the church that used to keep order around here. But it's Yuri who's saving us from complete chaos.
15117,Hilda: We need more resources around here. Please help!
15118,Hilda: We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
15119,"Hilda:Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources for us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation."
15120,Hilda: Wanted: Lots of lovely flowers. Any type or size is fine.
15121,"Hilda: We're gathering flowers as quickly as we can, but we still don't have nearly enough. Do you think you can help us? The prettier, the better!"
15122,"Hilda: Claude says that flowers on a grave are as much for the living as they are for the dead. If the dead don't look so solemn, then neither will we. That's Claude for you... Always trying to brighten things up a little."
15123,Soldier: Something is terrorizing the fish in the pond. Are there any fishing savants who can help me investigate?
15124,"Soldier: The fish seem skittish lately... It's said that every five years, in the wake of a storm, a mystery fish appears and eats up all of the other fish in the pond. They call it the Big One. I thought that was just a legend, though."
15125,"Soldier: You got rid of the Big One! Now the other fish can rest easy. Assuming fish rest... Anyways, nice work."
15126,Soldier: In need of capable fighters willing to hunt down deserters in Fódlan's Locket.
15127,Soldier: Some soldiers stationed at Fódlan's Locket abandoned their posts. They weren't what you'd call upstanding folks. It would be a real headache for us if they became bandits and started wreaking havoc in the towns.
15128,"Soldier: I heard that you handed a crushing defeat to those Fódlan's Locket deserters. Sounds like, after your little intervention, they've changed their tune and are back on our side. Thanks for keeping 'em in line."
15129,Soldier: Need assistance dealing with pirates along the coast of the Sreng Region.
15130,"Soldier: Recently, pirates have been raiding coastal towns in the Sreng Region. People say that they're attacking innocent civilians and sinking merchant ships. Think you can do something about that?"
15131,Soldier: Nice work out there! Some mercenaries heard news of your valiant leadership and have come to the monastery to offer their services.
15132,Merchant: Seeking a piece of history to start my collection.
15133,"Merchant: I want to start a collection that chronicles the history of Fódlan, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on anything significant. Honestly, it might be easier to excavate an artifact rather than trying to find one for sale..."
15134,"Merchant: Ah, magnificent! Exactly what I was looking for. Clearly, I asked the right person for help."
15135,Balthus: Requesting aid against thieves in Fódlan's Locket.
15136,Balthus: It seems some villages out near Fódlan's Throat have been having some trouble with thieves lately. Holst asked for help dealing with the problem. You mind coming along?
15137,"Balthus: Sorry for dragging you along on that, pal. But hey, would you like to meet Holst sometime? I think he's really interested in you. Maybe we all can meet up the next time we're in his neck of the woods?"
15138,"Claude: Everyone, listen up! I have a proposal. We are now building our forces in order to rise up against the Imperial army. But it wouldn't be smart for us to fight under the banner of the Alliance. That would only incite the lords who support the Empire. We've also combined forces with the Knights of Seiros. Therefore, I suggest that we operate under a new symbol. That's why I've prepared this..."
15139,"Claude: You may recognize it as the Crest of Flames, which resides in Teach. The phantom Crest that has reappeared after more than 1,000 years. We're attempting our own miracle, so it seems like a suitable symbol for us. So... Until we welcome the dawn of a new age in Fódlan... Let's fight to the very end, as one, under the symbol of the Crest of Flames!"
15140,"Hilda: Impressive, Claude. Forget restoring the monastery. You've somehow roped everyone into fighting back against the Empire!"
15141,"Claude: If you recall, I never asked anyone to join us. If anything, we have Teach's achievements to thank. Now that you mention it, I guess I should express my gratitude."
15142,"Claude: Hey, friend. So this is where you've been. Without you, the knights never would have joined our cause. I could never pay you back for that."
15143,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're welcome.
Choice 2: Let's do our best."
15144,Choice 1: You're welcome.
15145,Choice 2: Let's do our best.
15146,"Claude: Just leave it to me, Teach. When this fight is over, I plan to see all of my dreams come to fruition, and yours as well."
15147,"Byleth: What are you dreams, Claude?"
15148,"Claude: Well, for example... to bust open Fódlan's Throat. There's a massive fortress there, which is responsible for protecting the eastern border of the Alliance. I like to think of it as a lid on a bottle. The people of Fódlan only know a small part of the world. Their prejudices are born because they don't know what lies beyond their borders. And the opposite is true too. Those outside of Fódlan don't know about this place. Ignorance breeds discrimination. Whether you look inside the bottle or outside of it... If you really look, all you find are people who you can get along with, if you only try. That's why I wanna bust open that lid, which is keeping us locked inside. Or destroy the bottle entirely."
15149,Byleth: Are you going to tell our allies about this?
15150,"Claude: I'll find the right time to bring it up. Even if I talked about it now, it doesn't seem realistic, does it? First we need to defeat the Empire and restore peace to... Huh?"
15151,Leonie enters.
15152,Leonie: Professor! Claude! We're under attack!
15153,"Claude: I guess we'll have to cut our conversation short. What's going on, Leonie?"
15154,"Leonie: It's a small group, but some Imperial troops are headed this way. It looks like they were stationed nearby."
15155,Claude: I got to hand it to Edelgard. Nothing gets past that woman.
15156,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We should proceed cautiously. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us.
Choice 2: Let's take them down. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!"
15157,"Choice 1: We should proceed cautiously. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us."
15158,"Claude: As long as we don't let our guard down, there's no way they can defeat us."
15159,"Choice 2: Let's take them down. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!"
15160,"Leonie: All right! I'll show you how much I've improved, Professor!"
15161,Claude: This will be our first battle alongside the Knights of Seiros. Let's kick off our new partnership with a magnificent victory!
15162,Suggested Level: 27
15163,Victory Conditions: Rout the enemy.
15164,"Defeat Conditions: Byleth or Claude falls in battle (classic), all of your units fall in battle (casual), or a defended location is captured."
15165,"Randolph: The Knights of Seiros are a powerful enemy, but we have more soldiers. We'll take them down all at once!"
15166,"Claude: So, the enemy intends to use their overwhelming numbers to defeat us. Let's fight fire with... actual fire."
15167,Knight of Seiros: Report! The enemy has entered the periphery of Garreg Mach!
15168,"Claude: If they reach the interior, the enemy will take the monastery. Drive them back immediately!"
15169,Imperial Soldier: What? That strange battle flag is... But isn't our enemy the Church of Seiros?
15170,"Randolph: They didn't have enough soldiers with just the church, so they upped their numbers by joining with those filthy rogues. It doesn't matter what flag they fly. They're nothing more than a mob. We'll destroy them all!"
15171,Claude: Allied soldiers are making preparations for the plan. Protect them!
15172,Claude: What? The fire attack unit was routed?! Damn it...my brilliant plan failed.
15173,"Randolph: It looks like they were planning something, but it failed!"
15174,Claude: We're prepared for the fire attack. Now we just need to draw the enemy's attention. You can't defeat us with that many soldiers? The Imperial army is doomed without a capable general!
15175,Randolph: Quiet! Don't think you'll get away with mocking me! Attack! Make sure they never speak again!
15176,Claude: Now!
15177,"Randolph: Argh, a fire attack... The damage is too great. We can't fight anymore! All units, retreat! I'll take on our pursuers! Carry away the injured soldiers!"
15178,"Claude: If we let them escape, they'll come back to attack later. We have to take them out!"
15179,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
15180,Randolph: A total loss... But we can't just return home like this...
15181,"Claude: Teach, look out! They're after your head!"
15182,Caspar: You must be Randolph... My uncle.
15183,"Randolph: Caspar?! Yes, indeed... So, I see you have chosen to oppose the Empire. If so, be warned that I won't hesitate. I'll strike you down, even if we're of the same house!"
15184,Caspar: You took the word right outta my mouth! Graaagh!
15185,Claude: Those Imperial troops are really something. Looks like we'll face a lot of resistance in the future.
15186,"Claude: Phew! Nice work. We won without much incident, thanks to all of you."
15187,Knight of Seiros: I don't think the Empire will leave us alone now. What do you plan to do?
15188,Claude: I intend to ask the Alliance lords to share some troops with us to bolster our forces.
15189,"Lorenz: I will speak plainly. No matter whom we beseech for reinforcements, our envoys will inevitably pass through Gloucester territory. My father is being cautious not to give the Empire a pretext to intervene. Therefore, he is unlikely to allow even envoys to pass through."
15190,Byleth: Why not request reinforcements from the Kingdom?
15191,"Claude: Ah... I guess I haven't told you yet, Teach. The Kingdom isn't in a position to be sending anyone reinforcements. After losing King Lambert during the Tragedy of Duscur, a Regent had been handling it's politics. But then... There was a bloody coup. The Regent and Prince Dimitri both... Apparently the whole family was killed. All Blaiddyd territory, including the Kingdom capital, is being ruled by those who are cooperating with the Empire. The Kingdom is no more. It's not called the Faerghus Dukedom. The vast majority of the former Kingdom lords bent a knee to the overwhelming power of the Empire and the Dukedom, and now fall under their jurisdiction."
15192,"Claude: Some who formerly held power are continuing to resist, but it would be difficult for them to regain it."
15193,"Hilda: Oh, hey! I can think of one person who we can ask for reinforcements. Someone whose territory is really close, and who's on good terms with Claude..."
15194,"Lysithea: Ah! The Hero of Daphnel, I presume?"
15195,"Leonie: I've seen her before, and she does seem to be reliable."
15196,"Marianne: You're talking about Judith, right? I bet she would lend us a hand..."
15197,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She seems intimidating.
Choice 2: She seems strong."
15198,Choice 1: She seems intimidating.
15199,Choice 2: She seems strong.
15200,"Claude: That's right, you've met her once before, Teach. She's a fearsome one-woman army. She did a lot for me, even before I was recognized as the heir to House Riegan. I don't like the idea of owing her more than I already do, but given the situation, sacrifices must be made. I'll reach out to her. As for the rest of you, prepare for our next battle."
15201,"Claude: Heya, Teach. How are you feeling? Does anything feel, um... strange at all?"
15202,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Nothing in particular.
Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping.
Choice 2: I feel a bit sluggish.
Claude: Well, you were asleep for five whole years, after all. It'll probably take time to get you back to top form. Though I'm relieved to see you haven't lost a step as far as combat goes."
15203,"Choice 1: Nothing in particular.
Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping."
15204,Claude: Good. I still vividly remember you suddenly collapsing and passing out after you went through those changes. But maybe that's not a concern now that you've spent five long years napping.
15205,"Choice 2: I feel a bit sluggish.
Claude: Well, you were asleep for five whole years, after all. It'll probably take time to get you back to top form. Though I'm relieved to see you haven't lost a step as far as combat goes."

15208,Byleth: Any word from Judith?
15209,"Claude: Not yet, but there's no need to worry. That woman adores me. Once we've bolstered our forces, it'll finally be time to start taking decisive action. But I wonder... Do you really think Rhea is still alive?"
15210,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She's alive.
Claude: I think so too. It's hard to imagine the death of someone as important as her staying a secret.
Choice 2: I don't know.

15215,Claude: I wonder where she is and what she's doing...
15216,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you hope she's alive?
Claude: All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her.
Choice 2: Do you hope she's dead? (Relationship up)
Claude: That's a dangerous question, Teach. To be honest, I've given it a lot of thought. All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her."

15220,"Claude: That's a dangerous question, Teach. To be honest, I've given it a lot of thought. All I know is that I still have a lot of questions I need to ask her."
15221,"Claude: About the true history of Crest Stones and Heroes' Relics... and the truth behind the legend of Seiros and Nemesis. She has secrets. Too many of them for my comfort. Considering the state of the world... it's suspicious. You must be curious about what was done to you and what her plans were for you, right? And you never did learn about your mother, did you? None of our doubts will ever be clear unless we hear these answers from Rhea herself. In that sense, I absolutely hope Rhea is still alive. But as far as Fódlan goes, I do wonder what a world without Rhea would look like."
15222,Byleth: A world without Rhea?
15223,"Claude: The majority of people in Fódlan believe in the Seiros faith that Rhea preaches. That's why they accept the noble system as if it were the only option, and refuse to associate with those who believe in anything else. That closed-minded philosophy is the reason why Fódlan's Throat is locked tight. But if you remove the archbishop who strictly advocates that doctrine, that world view is no longer absolute. There's room for free thought. The leadership of the church would undoubtedly fall to you, and you would hold the power to change the shape of the faith. Of the world. Then, for the first time, people would truly be free to think for themselves. To decide what's right, and what's wrong. Honestly, I believe Edelgard is probably hoping to achieve something very similar. But her methods require too much bloodshed. That's not something the world can get behind. Anyway... The best thing we can do is find Rhea and hear what she has to say. Heh, oops... I guess I've been going on for a while now. Sorry about that. You should get some rest."

15235,"Cyril: Ya eat too much anyways, Raphael. Supplies are running low, so you're just gonna have to deal with it."
15236,"Ignatz: You've always been so level-headed, Cyril. Now that you've grown up, you're even more that way."
15237,Cyril: Maybe it's just that the rest of you haven't grown enough. You could work harder at being reliable.

15241,"Hilda: Mr. Leader Man has called a meeting about it. Hurry up, everyone!"
15242,Claude: We finally received a reply from Judith. The Hero of Daphnel has agreed to support us with soldiers and supplies.
15243,Raphael: She's gonna give us food? She really is a hero!
15244,Cyril: Maybe Raphael will simmer down now.
15245,"Claude: Now, regarding where we're going to receive the delivery..."
15246,"Judith: As this is a request from none other than the leader of the Alliance, I wish that I could send troops at once. However... Openly marshaling soldiers within my territory could provoke other members of the Alliance. Therefore, I will secretly gather troops in Ailell, the Valley of Torment. Will your group be able to receive the soldiers at this location? From there, it should be safe to return to the monastery by following the border between the Alliance and the Kingdom."
15247,"Byleth: Ailell, the Valley of Torment..."
15248,"Claude: Ailell is on the border between the Daphnel territory and the Kingdom. It'll make sense when we get there, but it's a peculiar region."
15249,Marianne: I recall there being a scary legend about it...
15250,"Claude: In any case, if we use that valley, we shouldn't have to worry about being noticed by other Alliance lords."
15251,"Alliance Soldier: Ailell, the Valley of Torment..."
15252,"Claude: You know… I'd never have been recognized as the legitimate heir to House Riegan without Judith's recommendation… Feels like I'm digging myself deeper and deeper in debt to the Hero of Daphnel, but what do you do? It's all been worth it. After all, we need the Daphnel army for our next move. It's possible we'll have to deal with our enemy sooner than later. Be prepared, Teach."
15253,"Lorenz: The bridge that links Alliance and Empire lands is currently under the occupation of the Imperial army. In other words, the Empire can choose to invade the Alliance whenever they wish. I want you to understand that my father does not support the Empire to antagonize House Riegan. He does it to deprive them of an easy excuse to cross that bridge."

15310,"Ingrid: My family, the Galateas, are an offshoot of the Daphnel family. The family split in half when two brothers quarreled over an inheritance. Despite blood relations, the families lived apart from one another, so the relationship has been distant and somewhat estranged. I’m not so much acquainted with Judith, the head of House Daphnel."
15311,"Seteth: Meeting reinforcements in the Valley of Torment seems an astute decision to me. In that land of oppressive heat, it is unlikely that we will be disturbed. It also means we will need to contend with those harsh conditions ourselves, however. Best ensure we are well prepared."

15320,"Alois: Even though we're getting reinforcements, we should still be prepared for the worst. Never shirk your training, no matter what. To practice, I'm going to chop something up with my sword. Unless you'd like to train together! Care to spar?"

15337,"Knight of Seiros: With the Faerghus Dukedom in place, the Kingdom is essentially no more. The majority of the lords who once belonged to the Kingdom are now under the jurisdiction of the Empire. Even the houses that haven't bent a knee yet, like House Fraldarius, will soon be crushed. It's only a matter of time..."
15338,"Knight of Seiros: It seems Arianrhod, one of the Kingdom's sturdiest fortress cities, has fallen to the Empire. It looks like Count Rowe didn't resist, and switched sides to the Empire straight away. I guess it did avoid unnecessary bloodshed, so maybe it was a wise decision after all."
15339,"Soldier: It seems some of our friends believe that if we get those reinforcements, we'll be set for provisions too... But I think it's best not to hold our breath on the food front. With the added headcount from the reinforcements, there will be even more mouths to feed."
15340,"Soldier: To the north of Garreg Mach lie the territories of the Charon and Galatea houses, former lords of the Kingdom. Even though their territory is being nibbled at by the Empire, they are still clinging to their neutrality. Since they only display enough force to defend their borders, I suppose the Empire has no incentive to attack them with any real strength."
15341,"Monk: I have lived inconspicuously these past five years, so as to not be discovered by the Empire. To be able to finally return to the monastery again is overwhelming... I hope that our brothers and sisters who ran far away will also return one day."

Lots of knights have returned, but not him. I hope he's safe…"
15359,"Resident: Bandits from Garreg Mach used to come down to Abyss pretty frequently. We never dealt with them, though. We refused their offers at every turn. Sometimes we had to use force. It was Hapi who finally drove them out for good. Only then there were beasts all over the place…"

15366,"Merchant: Thanks for helping me out. Here's your reward. It's a stuffed Nader bear! Cute, right?! This toy is incredibly popular with Almyran children these days. Feel free to show it off, but don't tell anyone where you got it from."
15367,"Anna: Urgent! I need help finding something. See me right away for details. I'll make it worth your while, promise."
15368,"Anna: It's gone! Gone, I say! I can't do business without it... Hey, you! Get it back for me, and I'll cut you the deal of your life!"
15369,"Anna: Thanks, friend! That's a huge relief. Now I can finally open up shop! I'll be sure to swing by the monastery again, so keep an eye on the schedule and bring lots of gold!"
15370,"Girl: When I got home after eating, I realized that the special thing Anna asked me to look after had vanished! Oh, what do I do..."
15371,"Girl: Hey, thanks a lot! From now on, I'll do my absolute best to live up to the standards Anna set for all merchants! Oh, and if I open a shop, I hope you'll pay it a visit or three, Professor!"
15372,"Hilda: Ugh, why is it so hot? I'm getting all sweaty!"
15373,Raphael: Don't be a wimp! Anything's worth it for more food supplies.
15374,"Leonie: Move over, Raphael. Somehow you make the heat even worse."
15375,"Ignatz: Let's stay calm, everyone. Once we meet up with Judith's soldiers, we can go right back home."
15376,"Marianne: Oh, I finally remembered! The legend goes that this valley was born from the wrath of the goddess..."
15377,Marianne: They say a pillar of light poured from the heavens and completely burned away the forest that used to be here...
15378,"Claude: So you're telling me the goddess, who is supposed to be benevolent, burned a forest to a crisp? Typical."
15379,Marianne: That's what the legend would have us believe. But it's not recorded in any of the scriptures...
15380,"Claude: Either it's completely made up, or the goddess is some kind of monster."
15381,Cyril: Huh? Is that...
15382,"Lorenz: The time for idle chatter is over, Claude. Look over there."
15383,"Claude: Ah, has someone come to greet us?"
15384,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Enemies?
Choice 2: Allies?"
15385,Choice 1: Enemies?
15386,Choice 2: Allies?
15387,Image of enemy troops in distance
15388,Lorenz: That banner does not bear the Daphnel Crest.
15389,"Claude: If memory serves... That's the Crest of House Rowe, formerly lords of the Kingdom. They joined the Empire's side without hesitation during the coup. And now here they are, lying in wait for us."
15390,Shamir: Damn... I thought we had disposed of all the spies...
15391,"Lorenz: House Rowe is mediocre and vulgar, but I hear their knights are powerful."
15392,Hilda: What about the Daphnel soldiers? You don't think...
15393,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm worried about Judith.
Claude: Judith will be fine. It would take a lot more than that to take her down.
Choice 2: We need to break through their ranks.
Claude: We've already been spotted, so there's no time to come up with a brilliant plan."
15394,"Choice 1: I'm worried about Judith.
Claude: Judith will be fine. It would take a lot more than that to take her down."
15395,Claude: Judith will be fine. It would take a lot more than that to take her down.
15396,"Choice 2: We need to break through their ranks.
Claude: We've already been spotted, so there's no time to come up with a brilliant plan."
15397,"Claude: We've already been spotted, so there's no time to come up with a brilliant plan."
15398,"Claude: Everyone, prepare for battle! I leave the command in your capable hands, my friend."
15399,Suggested Level: 29
15400,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
15401,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Claude falls in battle."
15402,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
15403,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Claude falls in battle.
15404,"Gwendal: The Valley of Torment... Perhaps a good place to finish off my life as a knight. Only if that puny force of children is able to kill me, of course..."
15405,"Claude: So, their general must be that stubborn-looking old man. He looks like he wouldn't even forgive a sobbing child. It's good we came armed for the occasion. Care to find Judith?"
15406,"Claude: Flames are flaring everywhere and burning people where they stand... Ailell is a terrible place. Everyone, if you don't want to get burned to a crisp, watch your step!"
15407,"Gwendal: The Crest of Flames? Ha! Quite full of themselves, aren't they?"
15408,"Ashe: Just as I thought - the professor's army. But it's too late to back out now. In Lonato's place, I have to do my duty."
15409,"Judith: Oh, old Gwendal is here. And he doesn't look to be an ally..."
15410,"Gwendal: Oh, the Hero of Daphnel is here! I'll expect more from her than the young ones..."
15411,"Defeat Conditions: All of your units fall in battle, or Judith is defeated."
15412,Kingdom Soldier: Here we go! Attack them from both sides!
15413,"Judith: You... No, let's leave the pleasantries for later. First, I want you to take this. It's nothing important, but it may prove useful. (gives Concoction)"
15414,"Judith: So, you're finally here, supreme leader. And something extra has tagged along."
15415,"Claude: Sorry, Judith. That rat got away."
15416,"Judith: Hey, don't worry. And here, you should have this. Perhaps it will come in handy. (gives Energy Drop)"
15417,"Ashe: I don't want to fight you, Professor... But this is how it has to be. There's no turning back."
15418,"Ashe: Forgive me... But as Lonato's son, I have a duty!"
15419,Yuri: Do you truly intend to forfeit your life for House Rowe? There's still time to change your mind.
15420,Ashe: I finally understand Lonato. He knew the price of standing for his beliefs...and he paid it gladly. I will do the same.
15421,Yuri: I like you- don't be an idiot. Or maybe I'll just have to smack some sense into you.
15422,"Ashe: I know this is it, but... I don't want to die..."
15423,(If Spared): You want to spare me? Why? I'll... I'll do it. I'll join your side. Let me fight for you.
15424,"Gwendal: So. You've chosen to turn your blade against the count. Heh. Never thought I'd see the day, mongrel."
15425,"Yuri: And yet you are seeing it, aren't you? Say what you will. I know your true feelings for me. Sure, you watched my back by order of the count. But you cared too. You were the only one who treated me as an equal."
15426,Gwendal: That is all in the past. This is no time for misplaced sentimentality. I must do what I came here to do.
15427,"Gwendal: Does a whelp like you really expect to kill me? I am Gwendal, the Gray Lion, a knight by the hand of Count Rowe! Do your worst!"
15428,"Gwendal: Ah, so I have found a place to die... Young ones... I thank you..."
15429,Claude: That old man must have been struggling with the position he found himself in... It's time to gather ourselves and pull back our troops.
15430,Judith: To think we'd get into a scrap here of all places. We're lucky we all made it out alive.
15431,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long.
Choice 2: I can see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
15432,"Choice 1: I'm sorry for involving you in this.
Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long."
15433,"Judith: Don't worry about it. In this day and age, it's a miracle I've been unscathed this long."
15434,"Choice 2: I can see why they call you a hero.
Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
15435,"Judith: Well, that's ancient history."
15436,"Judith: Anyway, long time no see, Professor! Are you still watching this boy's back?"
15437,Claude: Can you quit calling me a boy in front of everyone? I'm the leader of the Alliance now. It's not proper-
15438,"Judith: Not proper, is it? Says the leader who has neglected Alliance territory for years. If you're really the ""Master Tactician"", you should go back to working quietly at whatever little desk you do your planning on."
15439,"Claude: Ugh, don't call me that either. Who even came up with that nickname?"
15440,"Judith: It's a perfect title for a boy who loves crafty schemes as much as you do. You should be grateful to the professor. On your own, you'd look like a scoundrel of a leader."
15441,"Hilda: Haha! Claude's usually so flippant, but even he gets overwhelmed when Judith is around!"
15442,"Lorenz: As expected from the leader of the prestigious House Daphnel. Her dignity if beyond compare, even if she is no longer one of the Five Great Lords."
15443,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Five Great Lords?
Choice 2: The prestigious House Daphnel?"
15444,Choice 1: The Five Great Lords?
15445,Choice 2: The prestigious House Daphnel?
15446,"Lorenz: The five most influential lords of the Leicester Alliance. They hold the voting rights at the roundtable conferences. House Daphnel used to be included among their ranks, but division from within has hastened their decline. Their vote has since been passed to the emerging Margrave Edmund."
15447,"Judith: Thanks for the exposition, Gloucester boy."
15448,Lorenz: Boy?! I will not-
15449,"Judith: Now to business. There were some unexpected interruptions, but I've brought soldiers and supplies, as promised."
15450,"Claude: Thanks, Judith. I'll gladly take them off your hands..."
15451,"Judith: Hold your horses, boy. You're misunderstanding. These soldiers are precious to me. I made them what they are. I'm not about to loan them out to someone."
15452,Claude: No? Then why did you come here?!
15453,"Judith: What I'm saying is that I'll be joining your army. You're going to fight the Empire with the Knights of Seiros, right? Fight for Lady Rhea? Not without me."
15454,"Claude: That's admirable and all, but we still don't know for sure if Rhea is in the-"
15455,"Judith: Oh, she's there. A witness saw Lady Rhea being dragged off by the Imperial army after the battle five years ago."
15456,"Alois recruited:
Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?!
Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire."
15457,Alois: Are you sure your source is reliable?!
15458,Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
15459,Alois: It seems we chose wisely when we decided to fight against the Empire.
15460,"Alois not recruited/dead:
Knight of Seiros: Are you sure?!
Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
Knight of Seiros: So we were right in our decision to fight against the Empire."
15461,Knight of Seiros: Are you sure?!
15462,Judith: One of my own saw it happen. I'm certain.
15463,Knight of Seiros: So we were right in our decision to fight against the Empire.
15464,Claude: But you're the leader of House Daphnel. Is it OK for you to leave your territory unattended?
15465,Judith: And what about you? Is it OK for you to leave the Riegan territory unattended?
15466,Claude: That's... I've left it in the hands of a reliable retainer and-
15467,Judith: And I've asked that retainer to watch over Daphnel territory as well.
15468,"Claude: Wait, wait, wait... You just up and decided to get my retainer to do that without even asking me? No respect, this one..."
15469,Byleth: What retainer?
15470,"Judith: Oh? You haven't met him yet, Professor? His name is Nardel. He strikes me as a really special individual. And he's quite handsome too!"
15471,Claude: So that's your definition of handsome?
15472,"Judith: No objections, then? Good. That settles it. House Daphnel is now yours to command."
15473,"Claude: I'm sure you'd come along even if I refused. So be it. We'll be counting on you, Judith."
15474,"Claude: With Judith joining our forces, we've secured some more troops and supplies... albeit not many."
15475,Judith: Hmph. I'm sorry it couldn't be more.
15476,"Claude: No, it's enough for the time being. We'll use them to secure even more troops and supplies."
15477,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How so?
Choice 2: You think we can do that?"
15478,Choice 1: How so?
15479,Choice 2: You think we can do that?
15480,"Claude: The key to my plan is Count Gloucester, the leader of the pro-Empire faction in the Alliance."
15481,Lorenz: You intend to sway my father to join the other side?
15482,"Claude: If Count Gloucester were to switch to the other side, that would basically unify the Alliance. Then we could utilize our full military force in the fight against the Empire."
15483,"Lorenz: You don't mean to ask me to persuade him, do you? That would be... quite impossible."
15484,"Claude: I don't plan on it. We'll just take his concerns out of the equation. The Airmid River flows along the border between Gloucester territory and the Empire, right? Of all the bridges that cross it, the Great Bridge of Myrddin is the only one near Gloucester territory large enough for an army. Currently, the Imperial army occupies it."
15485,"Lysithea: So, if we were to capture the bridge..."
15486,Claude: Count Gloucester would be freed from the threat of the Empire. Thanks to us.
15487,"Lysithea: But we have to pass through Gloucester territory to reach the Great Bridge of Myrddin, do we not?"
15488,"Claude: Yes. And if we attempted it, naturally he would try to stop us."
15489,"Lorenz: I am sorry, but I must ask. Surely you do not plan to engage in combat with my father?"
15490,Claude: Don't worry. I want him as a future ally. What good would it do to waste both of our forces fighting?
15491,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I take it you have a scheme?
Claude: Who do you think you're taking to, Teach? Preparations are in the works even now.
Choice 2: So, we'll be sneaking through?
Claude: We can't be stealthy with so many people. But I have a scheme. Preparations are already in the works."
15492,"Choice 1: I take it you have a scheme?
Claude: Who do you think you're taking to, Teach? Preparations are in the works even now."
15493,"Claude: Who do you think you're taking to, Teach? Preparations are in the works even now."

Claude: We can't be stealthy with so many people. But I have a scheme. Preparations are already in the works."
15495,Claude: We can't be stealthy with so many people. But I have a scheme. Preparations are already in the works.
15496,Judith: So the Master Tactician is finally going to show us his true power. I'm looking forward to it!
15497,Claude: I'll do my best to live up to that name by making my scheme as impressive as possible.

15509,"Lorenz: Care to elaborate on this plan of yours, Claude? Can we really do this without battling my father?"
15510,"Claude: Pretty soon, Count Gloucester will need to gather his troops in the northern part of his territory."
15511,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Against the Kingdom?
Claude: The Kingdom has experience constant infighting since the coup. They're out of the picture for now.

15516,"Judith: The combined forces of the Riegan and Daphnel houses will threaten the northern part of the Gloucester territory. Nardel, that retainer I mentioned, is going to draw their attention."
15517,Claude: We'll take that opportunity to make our way through Gloucester territory and launch a surprise attack on the Great Bridge of Myrddin.
15518,Lorenz: And...are you not concerned about the possibility that I may tip off my father?
15519,Claude: The future of the Alliance rests on this battle. I'm certain you won't betray us.
15520,Lorenz: Hmph. I will ensure our success.
15521,"Claude: I know you will. If we win this fight, then our next goal will be to topple Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. I said before that my plan was to meddle with the Empire, but I'm going to do you one better. We are going to defeat the Empire, once and for all. But to do that, we can't afford to slip up here. Bear that in mind and prepare yourselves for the coming battle."
15522,"Claude: If our plan succeeds, we'll arrive at the Great Bridge of Myrddin unscathed. The important part is what happens next. We're evenly matched in terms of military power, more or less, so if we can just launch a surprise attack..."
15523,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We have the advantage.
Claude: I wouldn't be so sure. That bridge is almost like a fortress. The defense there is rock solid.
Choice 2: It could go either way. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: Agreed. The bridge is basically a fortress, so the defense will be rock solid.
Choice 3: We'll still be at a disadvantage.

15530,"Claude: But that's why you're here, Teach! No matter the odds, you're the wild card we need to win!"
15531,"Lorenz: I would like to believe that I have always made my own decisions. Even so, I cannot deny that some small part of me has always been aware of my father's wishes. Now, here I am. Concealing our plan - Claude's plan - from his sight."

15538,"Raphael: Thanks to all that food from Judith, I'm full for once! I've got so much energy! Let me at that Great Bridge of Myrddin! I'll bust it down myself! Oh, but then how do we cross?"
15539,"Ignatz: The Great Bride of Myrddin isn't just a bridge. It has the features of a fortress. I believe it was built for military purposes by the first leader of the Adrestian Empire. In other words, it's even older than the monastery. So if we occupy the Great Bridge, we'll have to search it from top to bottom."
15540,"Lysithea: I'm sure you know this already, but House Ordelia is aligned with the Empire. They face the Empire from across a river, similar to the Gloucesters. Even so, I refuse to yield to the Empire a second time. The Empire did unthinkable things to my family. And to me. The only option here is winning. Professor, you must promise we will overcome the Empire."

15547,Marianne: There's still so many things we don't understand in this world.
15548,"Hilda: It looks like people are slowly starting to come back to the town. I guess they feel safe now that you and the Knights of Seiros have returned. Peddlers have become more common too, so there'll be food and supplies available. After being run-down for all those years, it's really becoming livable again!"
15549,"Leonie: Things have gotten a lot more interesting since we've joined up with Judith, haven't they? Anyone who casually treats Claude like he's just some kid is not a person to be trifled with. I think Captain Jeralt would have liked her. I hope someday I can be as strong, kind, and levelheaded as her."
15550,"Ferdinand: What used to be Aegir territory lies far to the east of the Great Bridge of Myrddin, downstream of the Airmid River.

15569,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale.
Choice 2: I wouldn't blame you. (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
15570,"Choice 1: No, it's not OK.
Dorothea: Makes sense. A commander running away would be terrible for morale."

Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
15573,"Dorothea: Really? If something happens, will you keep me safe?"
15574,"Petra: If we can suppress this Myrddin, we can invade into the Empire, right? I was in the Empire. Now I will be an enemy... I am having strange feelings. It is with ease that an ally turns into an enemy..."
15575,Felix: We can predict what the Empire will do. Faerghus is our real problem. The eastern lords have joined forces and are warring with the Dukedom. But I've heard nothing about that conflict as of late. It's strange. I haven't heard much from my father either. I can't help but find this silence unsettling...
15576,"Ashe: It's thanks to you that I'm here now. I owe you, Professor. You saved my life. I swear I'll do all I can to repay that debt."
15577,"Sylvain: I had an encounter with Lord Gwendal... How many years ago was it? Back before the academy, I met this girl who I fell madly in love with...and her dad tried to kill me. I suppose he just tried to scare me, but I was sure I was going to die. Oh yeah, her dad? Lord Gwendal. Crazy, right? I never thought I'd seriously be trying to kill the guy in battle. I kind of don't know how to make sense of it."
15578,"Mercedes: Lady Rhea is in the Empire, isn't she? We should hurry up and find her. So many people in the monastery and nearby towns are worried...I want to ease their minds as soon as possible, Professor. Let's work together to find her!"
15579,Annette: Next we face the Great Bridge of Myrddin... We actually crossed it a long time ago. Do you remember? It was five whole years ago!
15580,"Byleth:
Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)
Annette: It seems like so long ago, doesn't it? It's odd how fast time flies...
Choice 2: When we went to Remire Village?
Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
15581,"Choice 1: During the Battle of the Eagle and Lion? (Relationship with Annette up)

15584,"Annette: What are you talking about, Professor? It was on the way to the Battle of the Eagle and Lion!"
15585,"Annette: Everyone was still friends then. After the fighting, we all ate together without splitting into our separate houses. But now we're fighting the same people who were our friends back then... Even Ashe... I often wish we could go back to those peaceful days..."
15586,"Ingrid: So, that was Judith. Just as I’d heard of her, she was an upstanding person. The same Daphnel blood runs through my veins, and yet I feel as though I am nothing like her. I am a phantom of what could be…"
15587,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You're actually quite alike. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: (blushing) You think so? Wow, thank you!
Choice 2: True, you do differ.
Ingrid: If only I could be half of who she is."
15588,"Choice 1: You're actually quite alike. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: (blushing) You think so? Wow, thank you!"
15589,"Ingrid: (blushing) You think so? Wow, thank you!"

Ingrid: If only I could be half of who she is."
15591,Ingrid: If only I could be half of who she is.
15592,"Seteth: If Rhea really is in the Empire, then we must defeat the Imperial army by any means necessary. The people at large are just as concerned for Rhea's safety as we are. The sooner we can settle all our unease, the better."
15593,"Flayn: Judith is a wonderful person. So strong and confident, as well. Looking upon her, I am sharply reminded of my mother."
15594,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Does she look similar?
Flayn: Not in the slightest. Rather, it is her way of being - her demeanor. Brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light.
Choice 2: Does she act similar? (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: Very much so! Both brilliantly bright and positive, like a warm ray of light."
15595,"Choice 1: Does she look similar?

15599,"Flayn: I... lost my mother, long ago. I miss her desperately."
15600,"Hanneman: The battle at Ailell was a tactical marvel. You grow stronger with each passing day. Where does your talent end and your Crest's power begin? Are they one and the same, I wonder? Most intriguing. Yet it is quite difficult to draw useful conclusions, given the situation. It is quite unfortunate I did not achieve my research goals before the war broke out. So much unknown. Now, I fear I will not have those answers even by conflict's end. So very frustrating."
15601,"Manuela: Oh, hello there, Professor. Did you need something from me? It doesn't look like you're wounded or anything. You just looking for... someone to talk to?"
15602,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority.
Choice 2: No.
Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
15603,"Choice 1: Yes. (Relationship with Manuela up)
Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."
15604,"Manuela: I thought so. Well, I'm here for you! Making you feel better is my top priority."

15606,"Manuela: Come on now, you don't have to be shy. Helping you feel better is important to me."
15607,"Manuela: Whether it's physical pain or worries of the heart, you can come to me for anything, Professor."
15608,"Alois: So, Lady Rhea was in the Empire all this time. Glad as I am that Judith told us, I wish we had known this five years ago. We spent all that time spread out over Fódlan, searching for the archbishop and you. It was a mistake to abandon the monastery, to leave it in ruins. Now we're paying for that mistake."
15609,"Catherine: I'd heard of the Hero of Daphnel, but that was the first time I've met her in person. She's the head of a prestigious noble family? Just like Claude. The Alliance nobility is so... odd."
15610,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You don't think she acts like a noble?
Choice 2: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? (Relationship with Catherine up)"
15611,Choice 1: You don't think she acts like a noble?
15612,Choice 2: Is it different in the Kingdom and Empire? (Relationship with Catherine up)
15613,"Catherine: Kind of, but I don't mean that in a bad way. You won't find such big-hearted nobles elsewhere. Plus, Judith can drink with the best of 'em! A woman after my own heart."
15614,"Shamir: Five years ago, when the Imperial army attacked Garreg Mach, they moved with incredible speed. But in the middle of all that chaos, she still had operatives watching. The Hero of Daphnel's spy network is impressive. She shouldn't be taken lightly."
15615,"Cyril: Is it true Lady Rhea was dragged off by the Imperial army? I heard that was true. Why'd they take Lady Rhea? Professor... they didn't take her to kill her, did they?"
15616,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?
Choice 2: They probably haven't killed her.
Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
15617,"Choice 1: I don't think so.
Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?"
15618,"Cyril: That's good. We just gotta beat the Imperial army and get her back, right?"

15620,"Cyril: Yeah, good point. If they did, we'd have heard about it by now."
15621,"Cyril: You gotta help her, Professor. I'm begging ya."
15622,"Judith: I don't know where he recruited that man, but Claude's got an eye for great talent. I'm talking about his retainer, Nardel. I've only spoken with him briefly, but he seems to have a fair amount of both brains and brawn, with the skills to match. But there's something about him I can't quite place... Like I've somehow heard of him before..."
15623,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I was talking to some of the Daphnel soldiers earlier, and it seems that Judith has a weakness. But they wouldn't tell me what it is! I got the feeling they didn't appreciate the question. Pardon me for being curious! That said, maybe keep this to yourself. Not that she terrifies me to my soul, but I'd hate to get on her bad side..."
15624,"Knight of Seiros: Year 1185 is almost over. From next month on, it will be the year 1186... It's just a date, of course, but it feels significant. I hope next year is a great one."
15625,"Knight of Seiros: Gwendal, whom we saw at Ailell, was once a renowned general known as the Gray Lion. And yet, as we fought him...it seemed like he was just looking for a place to die. Even if House Rowe, whom he served, is no more, he shouldn't have just given up on life."
15626,"Soldier: We came from the territory of House Daphnel. It's not easy to leave one's home, but it had to be done. Judith asked us so earnestly, there was no way we could have refused. We can trust you, right? I'd hate to end up just another pointless death..."
15627,"Soldier: On the north side of the Great Bridge of Myrddin lies the territory of Acheron of the Alliance, and to the south, the Empire's Bergliez territory. Count Bergliez has held the position of Minister of Military Affairs for the Empire ever since the days of Emperor Ionius. The current emperor seems to have brought the corrupt nobility to heel, but Count Bergliez looks to be an exception."
15628,"Merchant: I've been away from Garreg Mach for a while, but I came back when I heard the rumors of what you were doing. The scars from five years ago may still be raw, but it's nice to be back. Anyway, I'm going to start up business here again, so I look forward to your patronage!"
15629,"Monk: Hearing that the Knights of Seiros have returned, the monks have also been coming back. We still don't have enough hands here, but we'll use all that we've got to rebuild the monastery. Until the day that Lady Rhea is returned to us, we have to do all we can..."
15630,"Yuri: Damn, who'd have thought that House Rowe would show up. They must've been sweating blood to get to Ailell from way out there. Guess it's been a while since I left House Rowe, so it doesn't bother me much to have to fight them. Kinda always knew I'd be the one to take that stubborn old donkey out. I've been ready for this."
15631,"Balthus: Huh. That lady hasn't changed a bit since I was a kid. Still intimidating as hell. What a woman. Being me, I'm not nervous or anything. I just… I'm not sure how to approach her, that's all. My luck, she'll treat me like I'm still a kid, even though I'm clearly a full-grown adult man. Hm. If that's the angle she takes, maybe I can get some nice hugs out of this… Huh?! Oh, nothing."
15632,"Constance: Invading the Empire at last, are we? I cannot still the wild palpitations in my chest. I have made myself ready to the extent that I could, but now that the day draws near… I fear that to proceed will be to abandon all hope of restoring the Imperial house of Nuvelle. Which leaves me with no choice but to appeal to you and Claude for that. My dream is in your hands."
15633,"Hapi: I’ve never met someone like Judy. She’s easygoing, but at the same time, tough as nails. I bet she’d be real fun to hang out with."
15634,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I like her too. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Choice 2: She scares me a little.
Hapi: Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know?"
15635,Choice 1: I like her too. (Relationship with Hapi up)
15636,"Choice 2: She scares me a little.
Hapi: Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know?"
15637,"Hapi: Ha, yeah, same here. But in a good way, ya know?"
15638,"Hapi: Judy’s great. Unlike that other guy, Lord What’s-His-Name. I can’t stand people like him—people who think they’re always in the right. All he did was make trouble, but he convinced himself it was for a good cause. So infuriating."
15639,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Lots of things happen down here. Lots of reports need to be reported. And for all reportable things, I'm your guy."
15640,"Resident: House Daphnel was kind enough to share their food with us. It may not be much in the grand scheme of things, but the gesture means a lot."
15641,Rogue:
15642,Hilda: We need more resources around here. Please help!
15643,Hilda: We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
15644,"Hilda:Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources for us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation."
15645,Hilda: Looking for folks ready and willing to help keep our traveling merchants safe.
15646,"Hilda: There's a lot more merchant activity lately, isn't there? This area's still pretty unsafe, though. We should do something about it, before something bad happens."
15647,"Hilda: Amazing. All is peaceful now. And the merchants are safe. I wonder if we'll see any more new shops popping up at the monastery. If so, what will they sell?"
15648,"Lorenz: The Great Bridge of Myrddin is in sight. Beyond it, the Empire."
15649,"Cyril: Whaddya know. There aren't bridges that big in Almyra, that's for sure..."
15650,"Lysithea: How unsettling. There are bridges in the southern part of Ordelia territory, but nothing like this."
15651,"Claude: It's the most strategic location in that area to move a large army across the Airmid River. The Empire will want to hold on to it at all costs, so expect tough defenses."
15652,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's finish this quickly. (Lysithea relationship up)
Lysithea: You're right. The enemy's guard should be down, so let's end this quickly before they have a chance to retaliate.
Choice 2: Let's proceed with caution. (Ignatz relationship up)
Ignatz: You're right. The defenses are pretty impenetrable. Let's make our move carefully."

15656,Ignatz: You're right. The defenses are pretty impenetrable. Let's make our move carefully.
15657,"Claude: You're in command, Teach. Do whatever it takes to win. Well, other than sacrificing the lives of our allies for the sake of victory. Try to avoid that. Let's get moving. We're counting on you, my friend."

15663,"Ladislava: That symbol... It's an enemy raid! Stay calm and face them head-on. Send a messenger to Acheron immediately! If we're quick, we might be able to pull off a pincer attack!"
15664,"Claude: They say the enemy general, Ladislava, is among Edelgard's most trusted. Let's see what she's got."
15665,Claude: Our goal is to take down Ladislava and gain control of the bridge. Let's go!
15666,Imperial Soldier: You think we'll let you take this bridge from us?
15667,"Claude: Whoa, new enemies from the central fortress? By the looks of it, that might not be all of them."
15668,Ladislava: Acheron! Now's the time to show your loyalty to the Empire! Attack the enemy from behind!
15669,Acheron: I've got to make my name known to her Majesty through distinguished service.
15670,"Claude: Acheron the Weathervane. He's of the Alliance. He's a minor noble who holds territory to the north of Myrddin. If he's gonna support the Empire, no need to hold back. He's nothing but a nuisance, even to the Alliance."
15671,Claude: Looks like we can capture this fortress quickly if we take out the soldiers protecting it.
15672,Imperial Soldier: Enemies approaching! Get the soldiers standing by to join the fight! We may need to hurry up preparations of the ballista too. Protect the fortress!
15673,Alliance General: We'll ally ourselves with the Imperial soldiers too!
15674,Ladislava: Thanks for making your way here. Annihilate the enemy with the rest of them!
15675,"Ferdinand: I will leave this area to the reinforcements, and then I will swing around to provide support from the south."
15676,Claude: I'm glad we defeated them here... I doubt they're an enemy we could win against twice.
15677,Acheron: The declining Alliance will be finished if I kill you. The Empire will herald the new age!
15678,Claude: Only if you manage to kill me. Hm? What's that to the north? Looks like the home of another opportunistic noble is burning...
15679,Acheron: That's... that's my castle! NO!
15680,"Claude: That's the declining Alliance at work, right there. Seems like you were facing the wrong way, Weathervane!"
15681,"Ferdinand: Edelgard has always been obsessed with you. I am a little envious, to be frank. I will just have to impress her with my skills on the battlefield!"
15682,"Dorothea: Oh, Ferdie. You opposed Edie for so long... I had real hopes for you, you know? Now you're following her. Is that your duty as a noble? Follow your master when they say to heel?"
15683,"Ferdinand: I will not try to explain my duty or hers. You would not understand. I wish you could. Anyway, no time for idle chitchat!"
15684,"Ferdinand: Here we are, after all these years, forced to fight one another. What a tragic conclusion to our story."
15685,"Constance: It seems inevitable, but I am sorry that this is where our chosen paths have led us. We all do what we must..."
15686,"Ferdinand: Indeed...and I must put an end to your journey. I am sorry, Constance."
15687,"Ferdinand: After this battle, I will be known far and wide as the legendary Ferdinand of Adrestia!"
15688,"Ferdinand: Retreat, Ladislava! Tell Her Majesty about this!"
15689,Ladislava: We've already sent a messenger! I can't let you die while I flee!
15690,"Ferdinand: In that case, please... Even if I die, you must protect this area."
15691,(If Ladislava is dead)
15692,"Ferdinand: Even if I die, please... protect this area."
15693,"Lorenz: t's been a while, Professor. If this were anywhere but a battlefield, I would offer you tea. I've no choice but to follow the Empire, if I wish to live. I hope you will not think ill of me."
15694,"Claude: Aren't you gonna stand aside, Lorenz? Unless we win, the Alliance can't survive."
15695,"Lorenz: Even if that's so, to allow you past without a fight would be pure cowardice, I'm afraid."
15696,Claude: You are one stubborn guy.
15697,Lorenz: To oppose the Empire at a time like this would be entirely too reckless.
15698,Lorenz: Lay me to rest...in a manner that is befitting...of the nobility...
15699,Ladislava: To repay Her Majesty's favor... I will not let you pass!
15700,"Ladislava: I can't retreat... Even if it costs me my life, I've got to protect the Great Bridge."
15701,Ladislava: Lady Edelgard... I'm sorry...
15702,(If Ferdinand is still alive)
15703,"Ferdinand: Ladislava, no! I will protect this area."
15704,"Claude: Well done, everyone. The Great Bridge of Myrddin is ours."
15705,"Leonie: I was prepared for bloodshed, but that was more than expected... I guess I'm still not used to this."
15706,Ignatz: Even our enemies were fighting for their own cause. They held out without fleeing until the bitter end...
15707,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You don't have to get used to it. (Leonie relationship up)
Leonie: That is true. I wouldn't want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies.
Choice 2: We must overcome this. (Ignatz relationship up)
Ignatz: Yes... we can't afford to stall here."
15708,"Choice 1: You don't have to get used to it. (Leonie relationship up)
Leonie: That is true. I wouldn't want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies."
15709,Leonie: That is true. I wouldn't want to become the type of person who feels nothing when someone dies.

Ignatz: Yes... we can't afford to stall here."
15711,Ignatz: Yes... we can't afford to stall here.
15712,"Claude: Now it's on me to return to Alliance territory and convince those lords to join us. Lorenz, would you return home for the time being and lay the groundwork with your father?"
15713,"Lorenz: Fine. After all, this is for the Alliance. Or rather, for all of Fódlan."
15714,"Claude: For those of you who live in Alliance territories, I ask that you return to your houses, and spread the word about the current situation. Until we finish our preparations, Judith and the knights will do everything in their power to defend the Great Bridge."
15715,"Judith: That's a casual way to dole out such a deadly mission, boy."
15716,Claude: Do you object?
15717,"Judith: Just who do you think I am? I won't let the Empire pass this way, even if it costs me my life."
15718,"Claude: Too bad you're not allowed to die. Fight like your life depends on it, but flee if you're ever truly in danger."
15719,"Judith: A tall order, as always. I'll use my best discretion, Claude."
15720,Seteth: We have no objections either. Go forth and secure us a sufficiently powerful army.
15721,Raphael: I'll stay here too. The only ones I'd be going home to are my little sis and my grandpa.
15722,Claude: Are you sure you don't want to see your sister? It may be a while before you can return home again.
15723,"Raphael: But if I see her, I may not want to come back. So I'll wait till I'm done here."
15724,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What about me?
Choice 2: I'll stay here too."
15725,Choice 1: What about me?
15726,Choice 2: I'll stay here too.
15727,"Claude: Actually, I'd like for you to come with me, Teach. To help negotiate with the lords. They're followers of the Church of Seiros, after all. It'll make things easier if we have someone there to speak on Rhea's behalf. All right, everyone. Let's meet back at the monastery next month. Good luck out there."
15728,"???: Is that you, kiddo?"
15729,"Claude: I have returned, Nardel."
15730,"Nardel: Oh, ah, Master Claude. It's you. I mistook you for one of the local children. My apologies."
15731,"Claude: It seems you have adjusted to your work here. Our recent strategy was successful, thanks to you."
15732,Nardel: I was a bit concerned when House Goneril's army intervened from the east.
15733,Claude: Count Gloucester must have requested reinforcements from them.
15734,"Nardel: Yes, and they have that young general who won some acclaim from his battles in Almyra... Regardless, they showed no signs of seriously wishing to attack us, and merely fulfilled their obligations to House Gloucester."
15735,"Claude: This is my professor, who I asked to join me at the roundtable conference. Teach, this is Nardel, that retainer Judith was talking about."
15736,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Nice to meet you.
Nardel: Hm, how polite. I've heard good things about you from Master Claude.
Choice 2: ...
Nardel: You'll make me blush if you keep staring like that. Though I suppose people like me are something of a rarity here."
15737,"Choice 1: Nice to meet you.
Nardel: Hm, how polite. I've heard good things about you from Master Claude."

15741,"Claude: As you can see, he wasn't born in Fódlan. Still, trust me when I say he is highly capable."
15742,"Nardel: True. In fact, my capability is my only redeeming quality. I hope you'll continue to look after Master Claude, Professor."

15752,"Departing from the Great Bridge of Myrddin, the Alliance army marches south towards Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. An unknown military force begins their advance under the banner of the Kingdom, the Imperial army dispatches forces from Fort Merceus with the intention of interrupting them. The curtain is rising on a conflict between the three armies, which will come to be known as the Battle at Gronder, held on the same plains that witnessed the Battle of the Eagle and Lion.

"
15755,Claude: All of that went about as well as it could have. Each lord has agreed to provide us with soldiers and supplies.
15756,Judith: I'm impressed you were able to convince all of those scattered nobles to help us. I thought they would quarrel about how much support they should each provide. That's what they usually do.
15757,"Claude: Well, Count Gloucester took the initiative in taking on responsibilities. I presume that was because you spoke with him in advance, Lorenz?"
15758,"Lorenz: I merely explained the situation at hand, then my father simply followed your lead, Claude. It was because you had the professor there to represent Lady Rhea. My father is a pious follower of the Church of Seiros."
15759,"Claude: I don't doubt it. I wasn't under the delusion that it was my personal charm that unified everyone. Thanks for that, by the way. I hope you don't feel like I used you... because I sort of used you."
15760,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't mention it.
Claude: I appreciate that. We don't have time to be picky about our methods. But be honest. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you?
Choice 2: I'm not well pleased.
Claude: I understand. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you? You weren't even a follower of Seiros to being with, and somehow you've ended up as a representative of the church."
15761,"Choice 1: Don't mention it.
Claude: I appreciate that. We don't have time to be picky about our methods. But be honest. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you?"
15762,"Claude: I appreciate that. We don't have time to be picky about our methods. But be honest. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you?"
15763,"Choice 2: I'm not well pleased.
Claude: I understand. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you? You weren't even a follower of Seiros to being with, and somehow you've ended up as a representative of the church."
15764,"Claude: I understand. You're having a hard time adjusting to your new role, aren't you? You weren't even a follower of Seiros to being with, and somehow you've ended up as a representative of the church."
15765,Claude: I realize that you might feel guilty about deceiving the believers for our cause...
15766,Shamir: I have news. Our enemy is gathering troops at Fort Merceus. Their army is immense. Likely led by a renowned general. Or perhaps even...
15767,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Edelgard?
Claude: Well now, that would be interesting. If we can defeat the emperor, then the Empire will collapse.
Choice 2: The Flame Emperor?
Claude: Perhaps. But she's more than that now. She's the actual emperor. If we can defeat her, the Empire will collapse."
15768,"Choice 1: Edelgard?
Claude: Well now, that would be interesting. If we can defeat the emperor, then the Empire will collapse."
15769,"Claude: Well now, that would be interesting. If we can defeat the emperor, then the Empire will collapse."
15770,"Choice 2: The Flame Emperor?
Claude: Perhaps. But she's more than that now. She's the actual emperor. If we can defeat her, the Empire will collapse."
15771,"Claude: Perhaps. But she's more than that now. She's the actual emperor. If we can defeat her, the Empire will collapse."
15772,"Judith: There's something else. An unidentified army has approached the Great Bridge of Myrddin. They passed through the Daphnel and Gloucester territories from the northwest with incredible speed. They're raising the banner of House Blaiddyd. Perhaps they are the remnants of the Faerghus royal family. From what we could tell, they posed no threat to the citizens of the Alliance, and so we refrained from engaging them in needless combat."
15773,Claude: Maybe they hope to fight against the Empire to avenge their fallen prince. And what about the bridge itself?
15774,"Judith: Obviously we wouldn't let them pass without receiving envoys first. We thought they may try to force their way through. We considered firing warning arrows, but they left immediately, heading east."
15775,Claude: Are they intending to use one of the bridges in Ordelia territory?
15776,"Judith: Most likely. But the Imperial army still controls those bridges. I can't imagine what they intend to do in the Empire, even if they do manage to break through..."
15777,"Claude: I'm reluctant to ease up on our surveillance, but it would be difficult to track them there... For now, let's assume they're just troops belonging to the old Kingdom. In any case, we should proceed with caution. Soon, we'll be entering Empire territory ourselves. If our enemies are going to intercept us with an attack... It will probably be at Gronder Field... How fitting that it was the site of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion five years ago."
15778,"Claude: We secured the win in our first skirmish, but the next battle is a different matter. The Empire will come after us with everything it's got. Even so, the ultimate victory will be ours. And I'm not just saying that! I've made ample preparations to ensure our victory. It's my rule to never leave victory to chance. You can't rely on the protection of the goddess. With your power and my schemes, I should be able to plot a direct course to victory."
15779,"Lorenz: House Gloucester has changed it's allegiance and joined the faction that is against the Empire. The Alliance will thus remain united. But thanks to this latest ploy, my father is more suspicious of Claude now than ever. If such a thing is possible. Ordinarily, I might credit his helpful posture towards us to his devout faith in the Church of Seiros. But it is clear to me now that this is nothing more than a shrewd calculation on his part. He is only thinking of his position. We are in the clear for now, but please bear in mind that the Alliance is never an entirely stable union."
15780,"Raphael: I gotta say, it's tough to keep the fighting spirit alive when you recognize your enemies on the battlefield."
15781,"Raphael: It's like when we were fighting before... I saw Lorenz and wasn't sure what to do with myself. (If Lorenz was killed ""unused"")"
15782,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Everyone gets that feeling. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?
Choice 2: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"
15783,"Choice 1: Everyone gets that feeling. (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?"
15784,"Raphael: So you can't avoid it, huh? How did everything get so messed up?"
15785,"Choice 2: You can run away if you want.
Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"
15786,"Raphael: Hey, come on! Even I know we can't do that!"
15787,"Raphael: Just because we're fighting someone doesn't mean we gotta hate 'em! That's probably the worst thing about war. Win or lose, I still get a bad taste in my mouth."
15788,"Ignatz: Thanks to our victory, I've been able to study the Great Bridge of Myrddin at my leisure. And you know what? It's an astounding structure. So much history there. Imagine how much time and effort it must have taken to build something that big. Over water, no less! I hope that someday it will be opened up to the people of Fódlan - a historical site, rather than a military checkpoint."
15789,"Lysithea: I trust you and Claude, but I feel uneasy. If we lose in the next battle, the Empire's army will likely come surging into Alliance territory. If that happens, my parents won't escape unharmed. They've raised their anti-Imperial flag, after all."
15790,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I won't let that happen.
Lysithea: Thank you, Professor. I'll fight with all I've got too.
Choice 2: We can't take back what we've done. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
Lysithea: You're right. I chose my path. I must press on. That's all anyone can do, really."
15791,Choice 1: I won't let that happen.
15792,"Lysithea: Thank you, Professor. I'll fight with all I've got too."
15793,Choice 2: We can't take back what we've done. (Relationship with Lysithea up)
15794,"Lysithea: You're right. I chose my path. I must press on. That's all anyone can do, really."
15795,"Lysithea: Speaking with you has eased my mind a bit. Just enough in fact, to put me in the mood for sweets."
15796,"Marianne: I've been praying to the goddess for Lorenz... We wouldn't have had to fight like that if things were different. (If Lorenz was killed ""unused"")"
15797,"Marianne: Um, I heard that some unidentified troops have appeared, but... Apparently they were flying the flag of the Faerghus royal family... Do you think it was Dimitri's ghost? His country was taken before he ever wore the crown. Surely he must regret that..."
15798,"Hilda: Poor Lorenz. He and I weren't very close, but we were friends.(If Lorenz was killed, ""unused"")"
15799,"Hilda: Claude was saying that our next battle might be in Gronder Field. Is that right? Reminds me of the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. But of course, that was a very different time. When it was over, all three class heads complimented each other on their bravery. And then we had a party. But we can never go back to that, can we?"
15800,"Leonie: We might see Edelgard herself leading the enemy in the next battle. If they're coming out of Fort Merceus, our troops might even clash on Gronder Field. And those other troops on the march - who knows what they'll do, or what side they'll take? Not sure how we're supposed to form a strategy with so many unknowns."
15801,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't worry. I can handle it. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better.
Choice 2: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
15802,"Choice 1: Don't worry. I can handle it. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better."
15803,"Leonie: I don't know why you're so confident, but it does somehow make me feel better."
15804,"Choice 2: As long as you're here, I'll be fine.
Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
15805,"Leonie: Hey, how come you only ever flatter me in times like these? What am I supposed to make of that?"
15806,"Leonie: Anyways, we've come this far. Let's just keep putting one foot in front of the other and see how far we get."
15807,"Ferdinand: We captured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but the fight has only just begun. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital, lies far to the south, beyond Gronder Field. And waiting on the way there is the entire Imperial army, with twice as many troops as us. We had better brace ourselves."
15808,"Linhardt: I seem to lack the skills required to grieve for the dead. If someone has passed, even someone dear to me, I could stand about and wail or get on with my life. While I'm at it, that whole idea that we must speak well of the dead? I don't understand that either. If I didn't like them when they were alive, then why pretend to do so when they are no longer here?"
15809,"Caspar: After we cross the Great Bridge of Myrddin, we'll be in my father's territory. We actually crossed it five years ago for the Battle of Eagle and Lion. Remember? Ugh! This is terrifying! What am I gonna do? I gotta get a grip..."
15810,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!
Choice 2: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!"
15811,"Choice 1: Don't worry, I'll arrange for your funeral. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!"
15812,"Caspar: You think we'll meet him on the battlefield and he'll kill me? The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know! We might not even run into him!"
15813,"Choice 2: I'll pray for your safety.
Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!"
15814,"Caspar: Oh, no no no. You should pray we don't run into him at all! The front lines cover a long stretch of land, you know!"
15815,"Bernadetta: So the campaign continues, does it? Well, allow me, as a professional recluse with ten years of experience, to volunteer for, um...staying behind. Oh, who am I kidding? The fighting won't stop until we've defeated Edelgard, will it? Or until we lose, I guess. But there's not much use in thinking about that."
15816,Dorothea: The Great Bridge of Myrddin was considerably better fortified than it was five years ago... The bridge was full of soldiers...and they all died.
15817,"(if Ferdinand was not recruited)
Dorothea: And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?"
15818,"Dorothea: And Ferdie was there. We killed Ferdie, Professor, he used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?"
15819,"Petra: Nobles who are changing allegiance, again and again. I do not have understanding for that. How can you trust if treason comes with ease? How can you be calling yourself a noble? I do not have understanding of the reasoning..."
15820,"Byleth:
Choice 1: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
Choice 2: For personal gain. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?"
15821,"Choice 1: They're struggling for survival too.
Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal."
15822,Petra: Surviving is more difficult without trust. There must be...some other goal.
15823,"Choice 2: For personal gain. (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?"
15824,Petra: Survival has more importance than that. Are they not knowing this?
15825,"Felix: So, the boar prince is dead. Decapitated, I hear. I haven't seen the severed head myself. Perhaps he's still alive and leading that army..."
15826,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Would you be able to fight him?
Felix: Don't patronize me. If his head is still attached to his body, I'll remedy that without hesitation.
Choice 2: Don't get distracted. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: You're right. I can't let my emotions take hold."
15827,"Choice 1: Would you be able to fight him?
Felix: Don't patronize me. If his head is still attached to his body, I'll remedy that without hesitation."
15828,"Felix: Don't patronize me. If his head is still attached to his body, I'll remedy that without hesitation."
15829,"Choice 2: Don't get distracted. (Relationship with Felix up)
Felix: You're right. I can't let my emotions take hold."
15830,Felix: You're right. I can't let my emotions take hold.
15831,"Felix: Either way, a major battle awaits us. Try not to die. I'll be annoyed if you did."
15832,"Ashe: If we defeat the Imperial army at Gronder Field, what will our next objective be? I guess we won't have much choice but to try to take Fort Merceus, on the far side of Gronder Field. It's probably too soon for us to be thinking about that, isn't it? The battle just ahead of us is far from certain."
15833,"Sylvain: The time’s come to fight the Empire, huh? Wow, it’s shaping up to be quite the battle. And I’ve got no problem with that, but that mystery army really worries me. There’s no indication if they’re friend or foe… Who do you think they are, Professor?"
15834,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Remnants of the old Kingdom?
Sylvain: I suppose it’s possible. After all, His Highness is supposedly dead.
Choice 2: Dimitri himself?
Sylvain: Heh, not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge. That would mean… Actually, I have no idea what that would mean."
15835,"Choice 1: Remnants of the old Kingdom?
Sylvain: I suppose it’s possible. After all, His Highness is supposedly dead."
15836,"Sylvain: I suppose it’s possible. After all, His Highness is supposedly dead."
15837,"Choice 2: Dimitri himself?
Sylvain: Heh, not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge. That would mean… Actually, I have no idea what that would mean."
15838,"Sylvain: Heh, not unless he rose from the grave to secure revenge. That would mean… Actually, I have no idea what that would mean."
15839,"Sylvain: Well, whoever they are, I hope we can avoid fighting them."
15840,"Mercedes: So, we're finally going to set foot in the Empire...I'm starting to get a little nervous."
15841,"(if Ferdinand was not recruited)
Mercedes: We already fought Ferdinand at the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but..."
15842,"Mercedes: We already fought Ferdinand at the Great Bridge of Myrddin, but..."
15843,Mercedes: I guess there's a good chance we'll be fighting more old friends from here on out.
15844,"Annette: Claude seems filled with confidence, but I wonder if everything really will be OK… The Imperial army might be hiding the emperor, and the troops headed south might belong to the old Kingdom. I’ll be honest… I’m incredibly uneasy about all this. But at this point there’s…no option but to move forward."
15845,"Ingrid: I’ve cut all contact with my family since joining this fight. Were I to see soldiers of the Galatea Family amidst the host flying the royal family’s banner… I… Well. All chance of reconciliation with my father would end there. I do not know if that is the right path. But, the fact is, I’ve come this far. There’s no time for second guessing. Not anymore."
15846,"Seteth: Each time we press forward, our search for Rhea broadens to a wider area. I certainly hope we will find at least some clue, but I do suspect I already know where she is. If I am right, and she is in the Imperial capital, then we cannot save her until we topple the Empire."
15847,"Flayn: The Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Has it truly been five years since then? Can you recall whether it was before or after I joined your class, Professor?"
15848,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly.
Choice 2: After. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: I'm glad you have not forgotten."
15849,"Choice 1: Before.
Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly."
15850,"Flayn: That is not at all the case, Professor. Your memory serves you poorly."
15851,"Choice 2: After. (Relationship with Flayn up)
Flayn: I'm glad you have not forgotten."
15852,Flayn: I'm glad you have not forgotten.
15853,Flayn: It was shortly after I joined your class - I remember it like it was yesterday.
15854,"Hanneman: When undertaking research, the usual methods is to form a hypothesis, then test it with experiments. Those experiments reveal facts and falsehoods, yet sometimes, they also unveil an exception. You seem to be that exception when it comes to my Crest research."
15855,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Sorry about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Choice 2: I don't understand."
15856,Choice 1: Sorry about that. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
15857,Choice 2: I don't understand.
15858,"Hanneman: Worry not, Professor. Exceptions are what make my work interesting. Why don't the rules apply to you? I will find our eventually. I feel it is my destiny as a Crest scholar!"
15859,"Manuela: I hear the next battle could be a big one, is that true? I miss the old days when, if someone got hurt, we'd rush them to the infirmary, and make them well... But on the battlefield, there's not enough time to help. People die. Professor, don't be one of those!"
15860,"Alois: Word just reached me that the Empire has stationed soldiers in Fort Merceus. If they decide to dig in their heels and defend the fort, we'll be in a difficult situation. I hear it's an impregnable keep, surrounded by high ramparts. Taking it would not be easy."
15861,"Catherine: Beyond the Great Bridge of Myrddin, it's all unfamiliar territory for us. We don't know where Lady Rhea is being held. We ought to investigate all potential locations thoroughly. The Knights of Seiros will handle the search. We'll report back if we learn anything."
15862,"Shamir: Reconnaissance is becoming more of a risk the deeper we move into enemy territory. If I don't come back, assume I'm dead."
15863,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic.
Choice 2: Understood. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic."
15864,"Choice 1: I know you won't get caught.
Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic."
15865,"Shamir: I'm glad you think so highly of me, but we have to be realistic."
15866,"Choice 2: Understood. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic."
15867,Shamir: Good. We have to be realistic.
15868,Shamir: Don't waste your energy worrying about me.
15869,"Cyril: I gotta keep this place clean, and I mean properly clean, every day. Dust it, sweep it, everything. You never can tell when Lady Rhea might be back."
15870,"Judith: Since little Claude became their leader, the Alliance lords haven't been especially unified. Now, they're suddenly united for a common cause. As a result, the Empire hasn't been able to perform even one successful incursion... Rather, we're the ones who might get the jump on them. It's incredible. Magical, even. Maybe his strategic genius was simmering for those five years, and it returned to a full boil once you two were reunited. Or maybe he always knew he'd meet you again, and he was preparing for that this whole time..."
15871,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I hear we're sending troops to Gronder Field next. Is that what's what? That whole area is in the territory of House Bergliez. It's famous as the main granary of Fódlan. If we could capture it, we probably wouldn't have to worry about food anymore! Bread for all!"
15872,"Knight of Seiros: So, we're finally moving into enemy territory... We can expect the war to get even more intense from here on out. I'm really feeling the tension now. I have almost no experience with battles of this scale. Professor... I'll be grateful for your leadership on the battlefield. I know I can trust you!"
15873,"Alliance Knight: If this mysterious force if the remnants of the Kingdom, you'd think there would have been the possibility of a united front. But from what I've heard, that's going to be difficult. Their behavior is very erratic. If they're clamoring for revenge and death, then it's probably better if we have nothing to do with them."
15874,"Soldier: I can hardly believe we're crossing the borders of the Empire to battle their army. I never thought I'd see the day. You'd never guess from the calm looks on everyone's faces, though... I mean, we're probably all gonna die, let's be honest. If you don't mind me saying, you don't look like you're in the middle of a crisis either. Oh, um... Perhaps that was a little rude of me. Hm, actually, it's the Great Tree Moon now, isn't it? Not that anyone's in much of a mood to celebrate the new year, of course."
15875,"Soldier: I'm a graduate of the Golden Deer House, but that was a little before your time, Professor. We won the Battle of the Eagle and Lion. Of course, we mostly have Holst to thank for that. And now, he's the greatest general in the Alliance. I didn't do so great in comparison..."
15876,"Soldier: Edelgard's presence suggests that Hubert is around too. He is Minister of the Imperial Household, after all. He's been around Edelgard since they were children. I suppose he must be pretty happy with his current position."
15877,"Merchant: Since you secured the Great Bridge of Myrddin, trade got a lot easier within the Empire. Nevertheless, profits are rather thin, compared to how it was five years ago. You can't be much of a trader unless you're prepared to traverse the whole of Fódlan..."
15878,"Monk: So...we're finally invading Empire territory, huh? There's not much we can do right now, except pray for deliverance. I truly believe that we have it in us to succeed."
15879,"Yuri: My rule is never to play my hand if I can't win. That's why I'm here. To win. This is my life on the line. Don't let me down, yeah? In the end, I'm the one who decided to be a part of this, so it's my own fault if things go south."
15880,"Balthus: It seems the Alliance has avoided becoming nothing but a glorified battlefield. I may have cut ties with my family, but I'll admit, I'm still worried about how they're faring… For now at least, my little bro has managed to keep them afloat. He's a good leader, that one."
15881,"Constance: Across the bridge is Bergliez territory. It marks the start of our incursion into the Empire. Worry not. I feel no trepidation as we do this. Mark how my spellcraft carries us through to Enbarr, heart of the Empire!"
15882,"Hapi: We're fighting people we used to know from the Officers Academy. Guess that's the kind of thing that happens in war, but…still. It's pretty twisted. It makes me feel so… Oof. Maybe I'll just try not to think about it."
15883,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. The Great Tree Moon is finally upon us. It's time to celebrate a new year. We only get so many! Folks up top don't seem to be in the mood to celebrate though. I hate war..."
15884,"Rogue: I hurt my leg in the last battle. Had to take shelter down here—nowhere else to go. Be careful up there. All sides are bringing their strongest people to this fight. Count Bergliez in the Empire, Lord Holst in the Alliance... I'm sure the Kingdom's got someone too."
15885,Rogue: What a pain. What an absolute pain...
15886,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What's the matter?
Rogue: Concerned, are you? That's nice. A little too nice. Here's a word of warning—if anyone here asks you for a favor, it's probably just a scam.

15891,"Resident: I used to be a rather important person in the church, but...I am in exile for committing a crime. I embezzled some money. But it wasn't out of greed! My hometown was pillaged, you see, and the church wasn't putting in enough to rebuild..."
15892,Hilda: We need more resources around here. Please help!
15893,Hilda: We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
15894,"Hilda:Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources for us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation."
15895,Soldier: Do you know of anything I can use to calm my nerves?
15896,"Soldier: Whenever I think about the next battle, my knees won't stop shaking. I'm scared of getting hurt, or worse... Is there a medicinal herb I can use to calm my nerves?"
15897,"Soldier: It really calms you down if you make a tea out of it. Ah, even the smell is soothing! Thank you so much. Now I feel like I can fight again."

15903,"Hilda: Gronder Field should be around here, right? But it's so foggy... Even if there were enemies here, we'd never know it."
15904,"Lysithea: I recall the terrain from the Battle of the Eagle and Lion, but without the ability to see the enemy's formation..."
15905,Claude: Our enemies are subject to the same conditions. We'll just have to wait for the fog to clear up.
15906,"Judith: Speaking of enemies, what do you think became of those unidentified troops? Any follow-up reports?"
15907,"Claude: We haven't heard anything since. If they were headed this way... Well, I'd like to avoid being caught by surprise, but we can't make use of our scouts because of this fog. It's hard to predict this fight. There's no way to know what will happen."
15908,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm worried.
Claude : We did everything we could to prepare. If we lose despite that, then we'll just have to accept it as fate and retreat.
Choice 2: Let's try to stay calm. (Claude relationship up)
Claude : Of course. The morale of our allies would be crushed if we let them see us shaking in our boots."

15913,"Claude : Your guidance is going to be crucial, Teach. Now more than ever. Do whatever it takes to lead us to victory."
15914,Byleth: (Byleth nods)
15915,Dimitri: Know that I will tear your heads from your shoulders. The dead must have their tribute.
15916,Claude: As big class reunions go...this one's gotta be the worst in history.
15917,"Edelgard: Years ago, we fought here as classmates. But not today."
15918,Dimitri: Kill every last one of them!
15919,Edelgard: And so we fight on.

15925,Dimitri: I will crush anyone who blocks my path.
15926,Claude: Dimitri... He's alive. But he doesn't look interested in joining forces with us.
15927,Edelgard: It would not be advantageous to take on both at once. We must stop the Kingdom and the Alliance from joining forces. I will create such chaotic warfare that they won't be able to tell who is friend and who is foe.
15928,"Edelgard: Mounted units, advance!"
15929,Imperial General: There are enemies in the central area... We need to head there immediately to protect it!
15930,Petra: The center is in danger of being taken. We must be running to protect it!
15931,Dimitri: The Imperial army is starting to crumble. We will step on the Empire right along with the Alliance troops. To the eternal flames with all of them!
15932,Hubert: How kind of our enemies to fight one another. And open flanks as well? Generous.
15933,"Dimitri: If they're going to stand in our way, they must die. Smash them to pieces! It is time. Someone, take the central hill!"
15934,Edelgard: Those fools who went up the hill will pay with their lives... in the crimson flames!
15935,"Edelgard: This is not as I planned, but there's nothing to be done. Burn the central hill!"
15936,Hubert: The central hill is up in smoke. Suppose I'll have to quench the flames - with the enemy's blood.
15937,"Claude: Even in an ugly battle like this, it's important not to lose heart. We have to take pride in our victory. We did it, Teach. Now we can move forward. To our victory!"
15938,Bernadetta: Professor? Is that you? You're with the enemy. That means I... I'll have to kill you.
15939,Bernadetta: Stay back! Stay back or I'll shoot!
15940,"Bernadetta: Wish I could've at least died at home... not in the big, stupid field..."
15941,"Edelgard: Bernadetta, thank you. I'll make sure your life was not lost in vain."
15942,Petra: For Adrestia and for Brigid... I will be defeating all of you!
15943,Petra: I can't be fighting anymore... I must be retreating now...
15944,Edelgard: Don't worry. You must live on to lead your people.
15945,Hubert: You're interfering with the plan. Looks like I'll just have to get rid of you.
15946,Hubert: They're abandoning the central position to attack us? How leisurely. You're interfering with the plan. Looks like I'll just have to get rid of you.
15947,"Hubert: Fighting on will endanger my life. Your Majesty, I must withdraw."
15948,"Edelgard: No need to worry. We still have some troops left. So long as I stand, we won't give up."
15949,"Edelgard: I knew when next we met one of our paths would have to come to an end. Your journey ends here, Professor. Forever..."
15950,"Claude: We haven't seen each other since Garreg Mach. You've grown lovelier than ever, Edelgard."
15951,"Edelgard: You're not so unfortunate yourself. And you have the aid of the professor. Frankly, I'm jealous. Now's the chance for you and the professor to leave."
15952,"Claude: I'm afraid I must decline. Even if we left, we'd just have to come right back."
15953,"Edelgard: I will destroy both the Kingdom and the Alliance. Now, with one fell swoop!"
15954,"Edelgard: I lost?! Just as expected, you aren't making my path an easy one. I must retreat for now. We'll meet again on the battlefield."
15955,Felix: Want to die? Step forward. I'll take you all.
15956,Felix: Not here... Not like this...
15957,Dimitri: Felix...
15958,"Ingrid: We all choose our paths and I've chosen mine. I fight for my lord, to the death!"
15959,Ingrid: Your Highness... I... failed you...
15960,Dimitri: Ingrid...
15961,"Sylvian: Huh. I guess this is fate. Sorry, but I need you to please give up quietly, OK?"
15962,"Sylvian: Heh, I'm not afraid... I figured it would end like this."
15963,Dimitri: ...
15964,Mercedes: Oh! I haven't seen you in so long! It's such a shame we have to meet like this...
15965,"Mercedes: I'm... I'm sorry, Dimitri... I can't seem to stay... on my feet."
15966,Dimitri: Hmph...
15967,"Dedue: In the name of High Highness, you die here."
15968,"Dedue: I... can still fight, Your Highness."
15969,"Dimitri: Shut up and retreat. You must live, Dedue."
15970,Dimitri: Are you trying to stop me too? Then I'll just have to kill you!
15971,"Claude: Calm down, Dimitri! What does it achieve, us killing each other here?"
15972,"Dimitri: Move, Claude. I have no time to exchange words with you."
15973,"Claude: It doesn't matter what I'm saying, does it? You aren't even listening. But I'm not gonna budge."
15974,Dimitri: You're not worth it. Get out of my sight.
15975,"Dimitri: Where are you, Edelgard?! I will not stop until I kill you!"
15976,Claude: So... Edelgard retreated. I suppose she lives to be defeated another day.
15977,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's fine.
Claude: I suppose a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances.
Choice 2: It was close.
Claude: Too close. But I suppose all that matters is that we won."
15978,"Choice 1: That's fine.
Claude: I suppose a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances."
15979,"Claude: I suppose a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances."
15980,"Choice 2: It was close.
Claude: Too close. But I suppose all that matters is that we won."
15981,Claude: Too close. But I suppose all that matters is that we won.
15982,"Claude: Some of our allies are injured, but can still fight. We'll just have to accept this outcome and press onward. Still, the battlefield looks awful. And I wonder what became of the Kingdom army. And Dimitri..."
15983,Hilda: I saw him.
15984,Claude: Who? Dimitri?
15985,"Hilda: He was completely different from how I remember him. He looked like a crazed demon while he was fighting. He pursued Edelgard as she retreated, but he didn't get far before he collapsed. I saw him surrounded by Imperial troops and... pierced by their spears. I'll never forget it. He deserved a better end."
15986,"Claude: Dimitri... He went through so much to make it here, only for his efforts to be in vain."
15987,"Hilda: I can't even begin to understand what Dimitri must have been feeling, but... There must have been some other way. Why did he have to go like that?"
15988,"Claude: And his vassal, Dedue... Did he fall as well?"
15989,Hilda: I don't know...
15990,Dedue: Your Highness! Your ambitions are my own now! I... I will bring you Edelgard's head... I swear it!
15991,Lysithea: Professor? Claude? May I have a moment of your time?
15992,"Claude: Lysithea, what are you doing up this late? Trouble sleeping?"
15993,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's understandable.
Choice 2: We all have nights like that."
15994,Choice 1: That's understandable.
15995,Choice 2: We all have nights like that.
15996,"Claude: Anyone would be shaken after such a brutal battle. If you're having trouble sleeping, you should drink some warm milk. That's a thing, right?"
15997,"Lysithea: Must you treat me like a child, simply because I am awake a bit later than usual? Actually, I can hardly muster any indignation right now. I wanted to tell you that I noticed something odd during that battle."
15998,Claude: What was it?
15999,Lysithea: There were some strange mages among the ranks of the Imperial army. Did you notice them?
16000,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The ones wearing masks?
Choice 2: The ones dressed in black?"
16001,Choice 1: The ones wearing masks?
16002,Choice 2: The ones dressed in black?
16003,"Lysithea: That's right. I have seen people dressed just like that before. It was a long time ago... House Ordelia was involved in a rebellion that took place within the Empire 18 years ago. After it was quelled, all of the key officials were caught and put to death. The Empire sent replacements, who they used to take control of House Ordelia. Among the people sent by the Empire were mages dressed in black, just like those we saw in battle."
16004,"Claude: If they're Imperial mages, it would make sense that they would wear the same clothing, right?"
16005,"Lysithea: Yes, but the mages from back then and today... I do not believe they are from the Adrestian Empire."
16006,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are they Kingdom mages?
Choice 2: Are they Alliance mages?"
16007,Choice 1: Are they Kingdom mages?
16008,Choice 2: Are they Alliance mages?
16009,"Lysithea: No. I got the impression that they were from somewhere else. Somewhere completely separate from Fódlan. There's more. Those mages imprisoned the children from my house, and performed horrible rituals on them. Blood experiments."
16010,Claude: Lysithea... You can't mean... even you?
16011,"Lysithea: Yes. All of the others were deemed failures. They all died. And even I... It doesn't matter. The point is, that those monsters possess dreadful knowledge and power. I just thought you should know the sort of people who have allied with the Empire."
16012,"Claude: Blood experiments... Does that remind you of anything, Teach?"
16013,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The incident with Flayn...
Choice 2: That incident with the Flame Emperor..."
16014,Choice 1: The incident with Flayn...
16015,Choice 2: That incident with the Flame Emperor...
16016,"Claude: Exactly. There was that secret group who abducted Flayn and extracted her blood five years ago. The people involved back then were Tomas and Monica... Well, I suppose their true names were Solon and Kronya. So that eerie group has been slithering behind the scenes in the Empire for a while now... Lysithea... Thank you for sharing all of that with us. One day we will uncover the truth of who those people really are."
16017,"Claude: We've managed to invade Empire territory and emerge victorious in our first battle. I hope to maintain our momentum and push onward to Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Unfortunately, we are not legendary heroes in a fairytale. Our stamina has limits. The longer we fight, the harder the fight will become. It will take immense effort to secure the supplies and soldier we need to prevail."
16018,"Judith: Boy, you better not be saying this is as far as we go."
16019,"Claude: Of course not. However, the road ahead leads deep into enemy territory. It will be a difficult journey, strewn with hardship. I can't guarantee that we'll make it out alive. If anyone wants to leave, now is the time to do it."
16020,"Lorenz: I shall accompany you to the very end. After all, someone must step up to take leadership should you fall."
16021,Leonie: I'm coming. The future of my village depends on this. Besides... I have to protect the professor. For Captain Jeralt.
16022,"Raphael: I'm not going anywhere! Because of the Empire, my little sis can't live in peace!"
16023,Ignatz: We can't leave the future of Fódlan to others. I'm sure that everyone here feels the same.
16024,Alois: The Knights of Seiros will keep fighting the Empire. We won't rest until we rescue Lady Rhea.
16025,Knight of Seiros: The Knights of Seiros are prepared to keep fighting the Empire until we rescue Lady Rhea.
16026,Cyril: I feel the same as the knights. I've gotta rescue Lady Rhea no matter what.
16027,"Hilda: So, what - we're all supposed to take turns saying we'll do our best until the very end? And what about you, Marianne? What will you do?"
16028,Marianne: I... I'll fight too!
16029,"Hilda: Fine, fine. I suppose I'll tag along too... Until the bitter end."
16030,"Claude: It's an honor to keep fighting alongside such stalwart allies. Right, Teach?"
16031,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'd expect nothing less from my students.
Claude: Hey now, when you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're just praising yourself!
Choice 2: You're a stalwart ally too, Claude.
Claude: I know I'm a great leader and all, but praising me isn't gonna get you anywhere."
16032,"Choice 1: I'd expect nothing less from my students.
Claude: Hey now, when you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're just praising yourself!"
16033,"Claude: Hey now, when you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're just praising yourself!"
16034,"Choice 2: You're a stalwart ally too, Claude.
Claude: I know I'm a great leader and all, but praising me isn't gonna get you anywhere."
16035,"Claude: I know I'm a great leader and all, but praising me isn't gonna get you anywhere."
16036,"Claude: All right. Now that I know where each of you stands, I'm going to return to Alliance territory for a while. I intend to report this victory to Alliance lords and draw out even more support from them. Our next battle will be even more challenging, so brace yourselves for that."
16037,Hilda: Hmm... I should write to my brother. He'll want to hear about our victory.
16038,"Claude: Your brother, Lord Holst? How is he these days?"
16039,"Hilda: Oh, he's doing great. I even got a letter from him before the last battle. He wanted to come and join our fight too."
16040,"Lorenz: What's this? Lord Holst, come here? That would be a most reassuring development."
16041,"Hilda: Sadly, it sounds like my father was against the idea. They wanted him to stay in case they need to fight the Almyrans."
16042,Lorenz: Their logic is sound. Though it is vexing that the Alliance's greatest general cannot join us on the front lines.
16043,"Claude: We should be glad that Holst is staying behind. Almyra aside, there's also no guarantee that the Imperial forces won't try to launch a surprise attack from the old Kingdom territory."
16044,"Hilda: Um... If you have something you need to talk to my brother about, I'd be happy to send a letter."
16045,"Claude: No, that's OK. I'm just glad to hear he's doing well. Please send him my regards."

16049,"Claude leverages his victory at the Battle of Gronder to secure reinforcements from Alliance lords. Meanwhile, the Imperial army continues to tighten its defenses at Fort Merceus in anticipation of an attack on the Imperial capital.

16053,"While waiting for reinforcements, the Alliance predicts the Empire will continue to fortify its defenses at Fort Merceus. Knowing this risk, Claude an a select few advance, hoping to gain entry to the fort through deception.

16054,"Enemy reinforcements will appear from all sides of the fortress.

"
16057,"Judith: Our objective is Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. But our greatest obstacle lies before that."
16058,Ignatz: And what's what?
16059,"Judith: Fort Merceus. If we can't pass through, we won't be able to reach Enbarr."
16060,"Leonie: Fort Merceus... the Impregnable Fortress, or so it's called."
16061,"Ignatz: If I recall correctly, it's sometimes referred to as the Stubborn Old General."
16062,Lysithea: It is a massive fortress that was constructed to protect the Imperial capital.
16063,Shamir: The Imperial army we defeated has withdrawn to Enbarr. Fort Merceus should be short on soldiers for now.
16064,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We should attack quickly.
Judith: Yes, it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive.
Choice 2: We should be careful.
Judith: It would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive. Still, there's a reason it's been called impregnable."
16065,"Choice 1: We should attack quickly.
Judith: Yes, it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive."
16066,"Judith: Yes, it would be good to finish up here before more enemy reinforcements arrive."
16067,"Choice 2: We should be careful.
Judith: It would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive. Still, there's a reason it's been called impregnable."
16068,"Judith: It would be best to take it before enemy reinforcements arrive. Still, there's a reason it's been called impregnable."
16069,Judith: The only real question is what our fearless leader intends to do...
16070,"Claude: Sorry for the delay, everyone. Those mewling lords kept me from leaving for quite some time."
16071,Judith: So? Were you able to secure additional reinforcements?
16072,Claude: It's gonna have to wait until next month. It doesn't look like they can afford to keep supporting us at present.
16073,Judith: Then what should we do about Fort Merceus? Do you plan on waiting around?
16074,"Claude: No. If we wait until next month, the enemy will have bolstered their defenses. That said, the prevailing theory is that you need triple your enemies' forces to take a fortress with a frontal assault."
16075,"Leonie: Right, that's what we were taught at the academy. And this is Fort Merceus we're talking about. It's renowned for its strong defenses."
16076,Claude: Our current army isn't nearly strong enough. Hmm... What to do...
16077,"Judith: Whatever you do, just don't ask us to scale those huge walls. We'd end up dead when they hurl rocks down at us."
16078,"Hilda: Yeah, no thanks! If only someone would open up the gates for us from the inside."
16079,"Claude: Unfortunately we don't have any spies in there. Wait a minute... I've got it! We sneak in, stir up confusion, and open the gates ourselves to let our allies in."
16080,Hilda: Right! That's what I was saying all along!
16081,"Ignatz: Right. Nice one, Hilda. But how do you propose we go about sneaking in?"
16082,"Hilda: Disguises? If we dress up like Imperial soldiers, maybe they'll think we're allies and let us in!"
16083,Leonie: Do you really think they'd just open the gates for us? I'd be pretty dumbfounded if that worked.
16084,"Claude: No, no - she's on to something. It's a good idea, Hilda. We just need to refine it a bit, and we'll be in there before we know it."
16085,Hilda: Really? Go me!
16086,"Lorenz: What is your definition of refining the idea? I know your go-to strategy is nausea-inducing poison, but..."
16087,Raphael: Urgh! I maybe ate too much. My stomach hurts...
16088,Lorenz: Raphael... Why are you eating meat during a war council?!
16089,"Judith: So, fearless leader, I'm guessing you're going to keep the crucial parts of your scheme under wraps until the time comes, aren't you?"
16090,"Claude: You know me so well, Judith. Whether we like it or not, this war puts a damper on all of our spirits. What's wrong with trying to have a little fun every now and again? Just leave the details to me."
16091,"Claude: Each time we take a step forward, more blood is spilled… but by spilling that blood, we're able to take yet another step forward. War is always a cruel affair, but luckily we have each other to lean on. We've steeled our hearts. We won't be broken."
16092,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm glad we have such reliable allies. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: I couldn't agree more. Without them, we could never have made it this far.
Choice 2: I wonder if we're pushing them too hard.
Claude: If anyone's starting to feel the strain, I'm sure just hearing from you will reassure them. Please… do whatever you can to keep their morale up."
16093,"Choice 1: I'm glad we have such reliable allies. (Relationship with Claude up)

16096,"Claude: If anyone's starting to feel the strain, I'm sure just hearing from you will reassure them. Please… do whatever you can to keep their morale up."
16097,"Claude: Oh, and about taking the fort… I'll need a tad more time to prepare our plan. It's called an impregnable fortress for a reason, after all. My contingencies need contingencies this time, or we might not pull it off."
16098,"Lorenz: Fort Merceus is old and strong. Its reputation for durability is equal to that of Arianrhod. Are we really going to leave this to Claude? With a plan concocted by Hilda, of all people?"
16099,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm uneasy too. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: I thought you might be, with how secretly that man devises his schemes.
Choice 2: Have a little faith.
Lorenz: I would like to, but I am always troubled by how secretly that man devises his schemes."

16104,Lorenz: Let us hope the end result is not too outlandish.
16105,"Raphael: You know when you work your muscles and they start screaming? That means you gotta be nice to them. If your muscles are hungry, you gotta feed them, and let them rest when they're tired."
16106,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't see how you'd do that.
Raphael: Whaddya mean, ""how""? You just gotta eat and sleep! It's pretty obvious...
Choice 2: You can tell how your muscles are feeling? (Relationship with Raphael up)
Raphael: Of course! If my muscles hurt, then I hurt. If they're hungry, well then I'm hungry too!"

16111,"Raphael: What's with the confused face, Professor? You look like you don't get a word I'm saying!"
16112,"Ignatz: The battle at Gronder Field was gruesome, wasn't it? But perhaps it's irresponsible to look away - to close our eyes to the horrors of war."
16113,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I agree.
Ignatz: As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future.
Choice 2: You don't have to force yourself. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future."

16116,"Choice 2: You don't have to force yourself. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future."
16117,"Ignatz: Thank you. But I think I do actually. As survivors, we must ensure that all these lives were not lost in vain. We must see the tragic foundations upon which we'll build our future."
16118,"Ignatz: May an age of peace rise from the ashes, so that all this sacrifice means something."
16119,"Lysithea: As I suspected, they seem to be supporting the Imperial army now. Thought I don't quite know who ""they"" are yet… Nor do I know what tricks they'll use against us next. We can't afford to let our guard down…"
16120,"Marianne: I never used to care whether I lived or died… But after seeing so much death firsthand, I now realize how precious life truly is. I'm ashamed of how arrogant I was to think that death could mean so little…"
16121,Hilda: I wonder how far we can get with this plan. Dressing up like Imperial soldiers to sneak in. Claude said it could use some refinement. Any ideas?
16122,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We could dress you as the emperor. (Relationship with Hilda up)
Hilda: Dress me as Edelgard?! But we look nothing alike!
Choice 2: We could dress Claude as a woman.
Hilda: Claude, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."
16123,"Choice 1: We could dress you as the emperor. (Relationship with Hilda up)

16126,"Hilda: Claude, dressed as a woman? I don't understand what the point of that would be."
16127,"Hilda: On second thought, let's just stick to the plan as originally conceived. That seems safer."
16128,"Leonie: Claude takes care of the strategy, you direct the troops, and the rest of us focus on the fighting. As long as the system keeps working, we can win any battle, no matter the odds. That's what everyone's saying anyway. Hope you can keep up with our expectations, Professor."
16129,"Ferdinand: Dimitri, the late Prince of Faerghus. He despised the Empire with all his heart. He should not have tried leading an army while his emotions were holding him captive."
16130,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Leaders are people too.
Choice 2: Leaders can't be emotional? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)"
16131,Choice 1: Leaders are people too.
16132,Choice 2: Leaders can't be emotional? (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
16133,"Ferdinand: No. If a leader's emotions overcome them, others must step in to prevent poor decision-making. Why did his followers not intervene? His attendants? I used to call Edelgard my leader, and now she is running amok. I am duty-bound to stop her."
16134,"Linhardt: There's word that Claude has developed a rather interesting stratagem to capture the fortress. You know Fort Merceus's nickname, I assume. The Stubborn Old General? But there must be one or two gaps in its defenses..."
16135,"Caspar: Fort Merceus is next, huh? Ah, the memories. It's a huge stronghold in my father's domain. The town's completely surrounded by high walls. I used to run around there when I was a kid... Way back when a fortress was just a playground for me. Yeah, those were the days."
16136,"Bernadetta:It's always relaxing coming back here. But it's hard to relax knowing we have to go out on another expedition again so soon. And assaulting that huge keep? That sounds hard. Oh, really hard! Don't you think it'll be hard?!"
16137,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's going to be tough. (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Bernadetta: I knew you'd think so! I knew you-- Ow! Oh, ow. Can't believe I tried to hug you through the door.
Choice 2: We'll be fine.
Bernadetta: Of course you'd say that. Why did I even bother asking?"

16142,"Dorothea: So many people died in the battle at Gronder... And here we are, preparing for the next battle, as if nothing happened the day before. It's almost easier to think of war as theater, with the stage an entire continent."
16143,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Though the actors die, the show goes on? (Relationship with Dorothea up)
Dorothea: Something like that. If an accident happens on stage, the next day's performance must unaffected.
Choice 2: It really doesn't seem like theater.
Dorothea: Even if an accident happens on stage, the next day you have to sing as though nothing happened."

16148,Dorothea: Everyone just pretends like everything is fine... focusing on their role in the play.
16149,Petra: I have excitement in my heart for secret tactics! I enjoy attacks that are surprising.
16150,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why's that?
Choice 2: Because it's like hunting? (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey."
16151,Choice 1: Why's that?
16152,"Choice 2: Because it's like hunting? (Relationship with Petra up)
Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey."
16153,Petra: Yes. Hunting is doing surprise attacks on prey.
16154,Petra: Surprise attacks are safe with friends. Fewer injuries.
16155,"Felix: My relationship with the boar prince began even before I was born. He was always by my side. You might even say that, at one time, we were best friends."
16156,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean, ""best friends""?
Choice 2: What happened?"
16157,"Choice 1: What do you mean, ""best friends""?"
16158,Choice 2: What happened?
16159,Felix: I couldn't fathom the depth of his hatred for the Empire. So much anguish. Could I have saved him? Could I have stopped him?
16160,Ashe: I've heard Dedue's passed on. Just like His Highness.
16161,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We can't know that for certain.
Ashe: That's true. I did hear that his body was never found.
Choice 2: Don't believe everything you hear. (Relationship with Ashe up)
Ashe: You're right. I don't think anyone's found his body, so I guess he might still be out there.
Choice 3: Dedue is dead?
Ashe: That's what I've heard, but no one's found his body."

16168,"Ashe: If, somehow, he's still alive...I hope we'll meet again."
16169,"Sylvain: Ya know, Professor, laying siege to a keep is like asking a girl out on a date. First, you get past her defenses...then you make your move."
16170,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's not the best analogy.
Sylvain: Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I'm a seasoned veteran at this kind of thing. Girls, I mean. I've never actually, you know, captured any keeps...

16175,"Sylvain: Anyway, you know more about tactics than me, so I don't know why I'm offering you advice."
16176,"Mercedes: Oh, Goddess, hear my prayer. Please bless the deceased with peace everlasting...And may his soul rest in tranquility. You know, I used to see him praying quite often when I would come to the cathedral at night. I wonder who it was he prayed for back then..."
16177,"Annette: After the battle at Gronder, some people claim they saw my father. They said he walked off the battlefield clutching… His Highness's dead body… So long as Father's alive, I don't need anything else. I just… I hope to see him again one day…"
16178,"Ingrid: Among our prisoners of war, there were quite a few people who served His Highness. One of them stated that the Empire was involved with the Tragedy of Duscur. If this is true, His Highness's motives seem clear. I can't help but feel that perhaps I should have fought by his side…"
16179,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Why is that?
Ingrid: Because…I, too, lost someone to that tragedy—the most important person in my world.

Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong."
16183,Ingrid: No. Not anymore. I am where I belong.
16184,Ingrid: Those of us still on this plane of existence will carry the torch. The inhumane actions of the Empire must not be repeated.
16185,"Seteth: Fort Merceus is a keep that was constructed to defend the Imperial Capital, Enbarr. We cannot enter the capital without first capturing that fort. But once we have it, the city should be almost entirely at our mercy. Whatever strategy you have in mind, I have faith that it will lead to victory."
16186,Flayn: Standing face to face with those whom I went to school with. On the field of battle… How inhuman war is - how horrifying. My heart feels shattered. It is my hope that this war marks the end of such foolish behavior.
16187,"Hanneman: Fort Merceus is the Empire's single most fortified military installation. Utterly impregnable, they say. I wonder, do you happen to know the nickname given to Fort Merceus?"
16188,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Silver Maiden.
Hanneman: No, I'm afraid that name refers to the Fortress City of Arianrhod.
Choice 2: Fódlan's Locket.
Hanneman: That one is a fortress that stands at Fódlan's Throat.
Choice 3: The Stubborn Old General. (Relationship with Hanneman up)
Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."

Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
16194,"Hanneman: Indeed! A very good answer, but of course you'd know that."
16195,"Hanneman: Seems Fódlans give everyone and everything a nickname. Why, you were called the Ashen Demon! Myself, I have been called the Father of Crestology, which is a nickname as well as a title, I suppose..."
16196,"Manuela: Each step closer to Enbarr, I'm reminded of another part of my past. Riches and poverty, glory and failure, that city has it all! And if I'm honest... sometimes I miss it. That's how the past works though, isn't it? It's always a different story than what you really lived."
16197,"Alois: Hilda's quite a tactician! Disguising ourselves as enemy soldiers to sneak in, undetected. A stroke of brilliance. With this strategy, we can really snatch victory from the jaws of...deceit!"
16198,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's a good point.
Alois: Yes... With you leading our fighters, I've no doubt the Empire will suffer an embarrassing deceit. Get it? ""Deceit""? Again?

16203,"Catherine: I hardly recognize everyone... Their faces have changed so much. More experience in the eyes, and more pain. I'm glad that they're stronger, but I hate to think that they've all become hardened killers. Look after them, OK? Try to keep 'em on the straight-and-narrow."
16204,"Shamir: Please tell Claude not to give us any more ridiculous orders. I've reached out through all of my channels, but there are limits to these things. I'll have to recruit an entire town's worth of people if I ever plan on making enough Imperial uniforms."
16205,"Cyril: Guess what I noticed. I can see further than most other people can see. But I can't figure the point of seeing further than an arrow can fly, since I can't shoot what I see."
16206,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You could detect enemy movements in advance.
Cyril: I suppose I could see a whole horde of enemies coming and run away. That's kinda useful, at least.
Choice 2: You could find our targets quicker than anyone. (Relationship with Cyril up)
Cyril: Yeah, I suppose it could be real useful for finding Lady Rhea too."
16207,"Choice 1: You could detect enemy movements in advance.

16211,"Cyril: Thanks, Professor. I think I get it now. I'm gonna put my eyes to real good use."
16212,"Judith: Ah, Professor. I have a question for you… Have you heard of the Death Knight? I'm referring to that Imperial general who has been operating under that moniker."
16213,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I've heard of him.
Judith: Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough.
Choice 2: I haven't heard of him.
Judith: Well now… I don't know very much myself. Only that he's caused a great deal of havoc in the west. Nothing is certain yet, but I get the feeling we'll have to face him soon enough."

16218,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Is it true that we'll be assaulting Fort Merceus next? That doesn't sound like the brightest idea... I've heard that it's built to withstand an attack from even the largest of armies! Not to tell you how to do your job, but don't do it! I'm not ready to say my final good-byes to everyone..."
16219,"Knight of Seiros: After that great battle earlier, the balance of power in Fódlan has shifted greatly... To get revenge for all our fallen friends, we'll have to stake our lives on the fight that lies before us."
16220,"Knight of Seiros: Some say they saw Gilbert, who used to serve in the Knights of Seiros, at Gronder. Apparently, he was originally a knight of the Kingdom who served Prince Dimitri. He was an exceptional knight. I wish I could have fought by his side..."
16221,"Soldier: Doesn't matter how sturdy the keep, if the commander defending it is incompetent, it can fall as easy as anything. That's what they say, at least. I wonder if that applies to Fort Merceus... All I know is if I was the emperor, I'd never in a million years assign an incompetent commander to a fort as important as that one!"
16222,"Soldier: The fish in this pond get fed every day, so they're swimming all lazy and serene... But the only reason they're kept here is so that they can one day be used for food. But the fish don't know that, so they just swim around happily... It's a bit of a miserable thought, but aren't soldiers much the same?"
16223,"Soldier: Edelgard, Dimitri, and our own Claude... All the house leaders from way back when assembled again at Gronder. I wonder what their thoughts were as they headed out to the battlefield..."
16224,"Churchgoer: I've come to deliver vegetables we harvested in the village to the monastery's dining hall. Because of the season, I couldn't really pick that much, but I wanted to help you guys out, even just a little bit. We're busily planting seeds, so when things start to grow, I'll be back."
16225,"Merchant: Hey, there! We merchants of the Alliance territories were excited to hear of your victory in the last battle. We don't much like the prospect of doing business under the heel of the Empire. The Alliance is what we know and love, but more than that, it's low on regulations, which is great for business. Please keep up the good work, Professor! The merchants of the world are on your side!"
16226,Monk: I've come here after getting chased out of the Empire. There's no place for our kind there anymore. But there are still many inside Empire territory who haven't abandoned their faith in the Church of Seiros. I pray that one day we'll get the chance to rebuild the church within the Empire...
16227,"Yuri: If the Empire rallies its forces and attacks Garreg Mach, I'm not so sure Abyss will be OK… If we're not careful, it'll end up buried in rubble."
16228,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You really think so?
Yuri: Like I said, only if we're not careful. If it comes down to it, I'll protect this place till my dying breath.

Yuri: Heh heh… Ever the valiant one. But nobody ever knows how a war will turn out. That's part of the deal, you know?"

16233,"Yuri: Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I want to ensure there is still a refuge for people to escape to."
16234,"Balthus: I hear Hilda proposed a genius plan. That right? Heh, we've got a little strategist on our hands. Not too long ago, she was just a tiny girl who couldn't do a thing on her own. Now look at her. She's the fiercest of the fierce. I wonder what Holst would say if he saw her now. I bet he'd be proud…just like me."
16235,"Constance: It's not that I don't sympathize with Lady Edelgard's goals, mind you. But perhaps not to the point of shedding blood for her ideals."
16236,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Perhaps not. (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: I must keep her example in mind as I chart a new path.

16241,Constance: Peace in Fódlan and a restored House Nuvelle shall be my guiding star as I blaze my own trail!
16242,"Hapi: People have always fought, I guess. Bandits and nobles clashing over territory. Things like that. So before the war, when folks talked about how peaceful everything was, I thought, ""What continent are you living on?"" I get it now. A few isolated skirmishes here and there are nothing compared to a full-blown war. The one truly peaceful place I've known was the village where I grew up."
16243,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear there was a huge battle recently. Glad to see you made it back safe and sound. Maybe there's life after death, or maybe that's just a bunch of pretty words. Either way, we should live like our time here is all we've got."
16244,"Resident: Please, you can't tell anyone you saw me here. I'm in hiding from the army. I couldn't stand the war. The violence. I had to get away... But now that I've deserted, I can't go home. Justice, ambition—what does any of that matter if you're dead? I just want to live. Is that so wrong?"
16245,"Resident: I hear there was a pretty spectacular battle up there recently, but we don't hear a lot about that stuff. There was a lot of talk when it first started, but five years on... It's just a fact of life. What? There have been lots of battles on the surface recently? I hadn't heard! See what I mean?!"
16246,Resident: Got a wager for ya. My friend says there's twice as many women in Abyss as men. You think he's right?
16247,"Byleth:
Choice 1: No. The men aren't as few as that.
Resident: Good eye. You win. Here, have a little something. (Gives 5 Mythril)
Choice 2: Yes. Easily twice as many women.

16252,Hilda: We need more resources around here. Please help!
16253,Hilda: We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
16254,"Hilda:Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources for us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation."
16255,Ignatz: I delivered our letter to Fort Merceus. I don't think they suspected anything.
16256,Claude: I knew I was right to entrust that task to you. You've got that honest kind of face that makes it easy to fool people.
16257,Ignatz: Is that meant to be a compliment?
16258,Lysithea: What did you write in the letter?
16259,Claude: I informed them that reinforcements were on the way. It would have been suspicious for troops to show up unannounced.
16260,"Hilda: So, the plan is..."
16261,Claude: We'll disguise ourselves as reinforcements from the Imperial capital and sneak in to Fort Merceus.
16262,Hilda: Oh! You used my disguise plan after all!
16263,Claude: We've also procured Imperial army uniforms.
16264,"Hilda: Ooh, good work. I knew this was the only way!"
16265,Claude: However... That alone wouldn't be enough.
16266,"Hilda: You did say the plan needed a little more refinement. Are you going to dress up like Edelgard, Claude?"
16267,"Claude: I'm not sure that would accomplish much. In the letter, I included the name of the Imperial general leading the reinforcements. While we're heading to the fort, a separate army is going to attack us."
16268,Marianne: We're going to be attacked?!
16269,"Claude: That's all just for show, though. It'll be our allies who are attacking us."
16270,"Hilda: Oh, I get it! We're going to make it look like the Alliance is attacking Imperial reinforcements!"
16271,Claude: Right. When the troops in the fortress panic and open up the gates... We're in.
16272,"Judith: I'd love nothing more than for this plan to work, but I've got some bad news for you. Apparently the notorious Death Knight has been placed in charge of defending Fort Merceus."
16273,Marianne: The one who kidnapped Flayn...
16274,Flayn: The Death Knight... I did not wish to ever think of him again.
16275,Judith: He got some acclaim in the battle to subjugate western Faerghus. They say he holds the most military prowess in the Empire.
16276,"Claude: Even so, we've got Teach here to command us. All will be well. You have to trust us."
16277,"Judith: So your big plan is to just trust your professor? Really, boy?"
16278,"Leonie: Under the professor's guidance, I'm sure we'll manage somehow. We're counting on the tactics you learned from Captain Jeralt!"
16279,"Claude: Prepare yourselves, everyone. It's time."
16280,"Claude: Teach... This is for your ears only, but there's actually one more part to my plan. I had hoped it wouldn't come to this, but I have no choice."
16281,Byleth: No choice?
16282,"Claude: Absolutely. We can't afford to hold anything back. Thanks to Edelgard's strength, the Imperial army is more unified than I would have expected. It was a painful realization, but after our battle at Gronder Field, it's clear that we can't win if we don't pull out all the stops. I also realized something else during that battle. There really is something special about you, Teach. The reason we were all able to keep our cool in the midst of the chaos was because we all trust in you. In your command and in your strength. Everyone here believes that we will win as long as we have you on our side. Our faith in you is borderline religious. You and I... We have what it takes to free Fódlan from the Empire's rule. I know in my heart that we'll make it through to witness the world after all the fighting has ceased."
16283,Death Knight: That man/woman approaches...
16284,"Caspar: Who are you talking about? You don't mean that professor, do you?! Doesn't matter. No one could take this fortress."
16285,"Linhardt: Ugh, sounds like a bother... I'll be taking a nap about now."
16286,Death Knight: Will death's scythe claim you... Or will I fall to that sword of yours...

16292,"Imperial Soldier: General, reinforcements have arrived from the capital. They clashed with Alliance forces in the outskirts of the city, but should enter the fortress soon."
16293,Death Knight: You let them in? Make haste and slaughter them all.
16294,Imperial Soldier: Huh? Why?
16295,Death Knight: They are enemies. Slaughter them all. I will not say it again.
16296,"Claude: We made it in. Professor, take control from the south. I have my own task to do from here. There are preparations to be made for our secret plan."
16297,"Nader: I see your skills haven't dulled yet, kiddo."
16298,Claude: What did you expect?
16299,"Claude: Everyone, listen up! From now on, the Almyran forces will be fighting by our side!"
16300,Claude: We'll work as one! And we will bring down that fort together!
16301,"Claude: An impregnable fortress is a wide-open prairie once you get inside. From here, we'll attack from the north and south at once!"
16302,"Nader: No different than a prairie, you say? Heh! You've got a strange head on your shoulders, kiddo"
16303,"Claude: For Nader the Undefeated, this should be as easy as a walk in a meadow, right?"
16304,"Nader: Heh. Well, goddess or death god or whoever they may be, let's crush them to dust."
16305,Death Knight: The time of ruin draws near... But their slaughter must wait until next we meet...
16306,Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight has escaped the fortress!
16307,"Claude: He gave up too easily. Does he have some other plan? Let's deal with the remaining enemies and go after him, quickly!"
16308,"Caspar: Looks like we ended up on opposing sides, Linhardt!"
16309,"Linhardt: Certainly seems that way. I could almost weep over how things turned out. Do you realize, Caspar, that this is the first time we've ever fought?"
16310,"Caspar: Yeah, I think you're right. The first and probably the last!"
16311,"Caspar: Looks like we ended up on opposing sides, Linhardt!"
16312,"Linhardt: Certainly seems that way. I could almost weep over how things turned out. Do you realize, Caspar, that this is the first time we've ever fought?"
16313,"Caspar: Yeah, I think you're right. The first and probably the last!"
16314,Death Knight: The time is ripe.
16315,Alliance Soldier: Report! The Death Knight is moving! It looks like they're abandoning the fortress and making an escape!
16316,"Claude: We need to put an end to this here and now. Come on, let's circle around and cut off his retreat."
16317,"Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!"
16318,Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
16319,"Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face."
16320,"Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!"
16321,Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
16322,Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!
16323,"Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general..."
16324,"Death Knight: So, you wish to die."
16325,"Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see."
16326,"Death Knight: If you desire to slay me, follow. The appointed hour is at hand..."
16327,"Claude: He's hiding something... It's annoying to do what he's telling us to, but we don't really have a choice. After him!"
16328,Death Knight: It is coming... Leave now or all of you will die.
16329,Alliance Soldier in Imperial gear: Run! We have to evacuate immediately!
16330,Alliance Infantry Soldier: What just happened here?
16331,"Alliance Armored Soldier: The fort, it's... It's just... gone."
16332,"Nader: Hey, kiddo! What was with that... javelin of... light?"
16333,"Claude: Javelin of light... That describes it pretty well. The fortress was supposedly impregnable, but look at it now.It's hard to imagine that the Empire would do something like that. But if not them, then who? And for what purpose? If they wanted to kill us, then why wait until now to use it?"
16334,"Judith: We almost died just now... and without an answer to any of that. Speaking of unanswered questions, why is Nardel here? Care to explain? I get the feeling there's something you two are keeping from us."
16335,"Nader: I'll go ahead and see my subordinates off to Almyra, kiddo."
16336,"Claude: Wait, Nader! Are really going to just leave me here and run away?"
16337,"Nader: I hope to see you again, Judith. And you too, Professor. I'll be praying for your safety!"
16338,Judith: Nader? Are you saying that Nardel is actually Nader the Unstoppable?!
16339,Byleth: Unstoppable?
16340,"Claude: It's actually ""Nader the Undefeated."" Almyrans love grand titles."
16341,"Judith: I knew he was no ordinary person, but to think he was the great hero of Almyra..."
16342,"Hilda: Hey, um, can we really afford to be chatting right now? If another one of those javelins of light falls, we're all dead!"
16343,"Lorenz: Claude. There are things I wish to ask you, but first we must hurry and withdraw."
16344,"Claude: Right you are. Come on, everyone! Let's hurry up and get out of here."
16345,Lorenz: Claude. It is time for you to explain. Why are you so close with an Almyran general?
16346,"Claude: Well, he did quite a bit for me when I was younger."
16347,"Lorenz: When you were younger... So, before you joined House Riegan. How and where did you meet him? There aren't many opportunities to meet a general from Almyra in Fódlan..."
16348,"Claude: If that's what you believe, it's only because that's what you've been led to believe. After all, we have Cyril here among our allies, and he was born in Almyra."
16349,"Cyril: Hey, now. Don't drag me into this."
16350,"Claude: There's a big, wide world outside of Fódlan, and it's overflowing with different places and cultures. You think interacting with outsiders is odd, but isn't avoiding contact with the outside world far more unnatural?"
16351,"Lorenz: Don't change the subject, Claude. To the people of the Alliance, the Almyrans are-"
16352,"Claude: It's true that there's a history of hostility, but why should that mean we're doomed to remain hostile forever? The Almyrans aren't monsters. Just look at Cyril! Does he look like a monster to you?"
16353,"Cyril: Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
16354,"Claude: Right, Teach? What did you think when you met Nader?"
16355,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He's... interesting.
Choice 2: He's a reliable general."
16356,Choice 1: He's... interesting.
16357,Choice 2: He's a reliable general.
16358,"Claude: Ha! I'll tell him you said that. And I'm sure that if all of you got to know him, all of your preconceived notions would change too. I know you guys, and you aren't the type of people to reject someone without trying to get to know them."
16359,Hilda: But... how did those Almyrans even get past Fódlan's Throat? I doubt my brother would just let them pass without saying anything...
16360,Claude: About that... I actually made sure your brother met Nader in advance.
16361,Lorenz: What?! Lord Holst met with an Almyran general?
16362,"Hilda: Oh, so that's why you were so interested in my brother. But wait, they're supposed to be bitter enemies! They've fought each other several times before!"
16363,"Claude: I know. It was a big gamble. But rather than having me try to convince them myself, I knew it would be easier to just have them meet. They were taken aback at first, but sure enough, they hit it off. They were even drinking to their newfound brotherhood before parting."
16364,"Judith: It makes sense. If you take the greatest heroes away from the battlefield, of course they'll get along."
16365,Hilda: Fighting one minute and drinking together the next... Men are so weird!
16366,"Claude: Ultimately, someone's bloodline has nothing to do with the friendships they forge. Relations between the Alliance and Almyra is a matter we'll tackle in the future. Still, I want to take this opportunity to make one thing clear to all of you. After we defeat the Empire, I intend to tear down the walls that separate Fódlan from the outside world. I want to let people and goods come and go freely, and in doing so, eradicate prejudices about the outside world."
16367,Cyril: Huh?!
16368,Lorenz: Would it even be possible to achieve such a thing? It directly contradicts the Seiros tenets.
16369,"Claude: Does it? I'm not so sure. I'm any case, I'm prepared for the inevitable protests and criticism. New ways of doing things are always met with resistance. During our time at the Officer's Academy, all of you overcame the barriers of birthplace, status, and ideology. Having gone through so much with all of you, I have no doubt that, in time, you'll understand."
16370,Hilda: I guess there were a lot of different people there. People we wouldn't have met through the normal course of our lives.
16371,"Claude: Duscur once opposed the Kingdom, but there was someone from Duscur there. Brigid once invaded the Empire, but the Brigid princess was there. We ate at the same table as those people. Sure, sometimes we didn't get along. But other times, we helped each other out. Can we really draw a definitive line in the sand and say one group of people is all good, and another all bad? If I can realize my dream, Fódlan will be reborn. The old age will end and we'll welcome a new dawn."
16372,"Lorenz: But, if-"
16373,"Judith: Save your objections for another day, Gloucester boy."
16374,Lorenz: Ugh...
16375,"Judith: That said, there are more pressing matters to discuss. Our next step is to invade the Imperial capital, right?"
16376,Claude: That's right. I'm sure Edelgard is eagerly awaiting our arrival in Enbarr. Reinforcements from the Alliance lords should arrive soon. Let's make sure we're ready to greet them.

Choice 1: We need to save her quickly.
Claude: I know, but if we're not careful she'll just be whisked away again.

Claude: I understand. You need to see Rhea again so you can figure out who you really are.
Choice 2: All I care about right now is saving her.
Claude: Well, if that's what you want, I'll do my best to make it happen."
16398,"Choice 1: I need to see her again.
Claude: I understand. You need to see Rhea again so you can figure out who you really are."

16401,"Claude: Well, if that's what you want, I'll do my best to make it happen."
16402,Claude: But we're going up against Edelgard here... It won't be so simple.
16403,Hilda: Our next stop is the Imperial capital. We've sure come a long way.
16404,Raphael: What're you talking about? This is Garreg Mach! It's where we started.
16405,"Hilda: I didn't mean literally, Raphael. I was speaking symbolically!"
16406,"Lorenz: My earnest desire to protect the Alliance has carried me this far. It will not fail me. I am sure the rest of you all have your own reasons to fight as well. Of course, I understand that the fight will not end until we defeat the Empire... And now the time has arrived at long last to march on the Imperial capital and defeat the emperor..."
16407,"Hilda: It really gets you thinking, doesn't it? We all come from different places and have different goals and dreams. But thanks to those two, we were all able to come together and overcome all sorts of challenges."
16408,"Lysithea: You are referring to Claude and the professor, I assume. Even within our own odd group, those two are particularly unusual."
16409,"Hilda: Oh! So, you are aware that you're odd!"
16410,Lysithea: Well... That's... It was simply a figure of speech. I am speaking about Claude and the professor right now!
16411,Marianne: They're like the wind and the trees...
16412,"Hilda: Huh? Claude and the professor are? What does that even mean, and who is which?"
16413,"Marianne: Oh, um... I was just thinking that if we're the birds, then those two are like the trees and the wind. The professor is a great tree that kindly embraces us and watches over us as we perch on its branches... And Claude is like the wind, pushing us forward as we soar across the open sky..."
16414,"Hilda: Hm. The metaphor about the professor is solid, but I think Claude just blows us around on a whim. Still, we owe him a lot."
16415,"Ignatz: I think that's beautiful, Marianne. I can really picture it. When the war is over, I'd love to paint a picture of those two. Oh! And of all the people we've fought with as well!"
16416,"Leonie: You mean like a historical painting? I like that! Maybe our descendants will look at it a long, long time from now..."
16417,"Lorenz: I must say, that piques my interest. I look forward to seeing how you portray my valiant efforts."
16418,"Leonie: When you put it that way, we may be witnessing one of the greatest events in Fódlan's history. It's a lot of pressure, but the sense of duty I feel is even stronger than the fear."
16419,"Raphael: I'm just happy to be here with all of you! I won't get scared, no matter what we face!"
16420,"Hilda: We have our goal. Enbarr, the Imperial Capital. Let's get to work!"
16421,"Claude: My friend! The reinforcements the lords sent are finally gathering. Truth be told, Fort Merceus would've made for a better base of operation. But that weird pillar of light changes things. It's pretty scary, honestly... I wonder what it is..."
16422,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The rage of the goddess.
Claude: Well, that is how the legend goes in Ailell. If it really was the rage of the goddess, let's do our best not to enrage her even further.
Choice 2: Some kind of magic. (Relationship with Claude up)
Claude: Makes sense. But whatever it was, I've never seen destructive power quite like it. I wonder where it came from...
Choice 3: A natural phenomenon.
Claude: You think it's natural? What, the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort? I dunno, Teach."

16428,"Claude: You think it's natural? What, the planet just up and decided to take a shot at the fort? I dunno, Teach."
16429,"Claude: Well, I guess pondering it is a waste of energy for now. Let's just get ready to move out. The capital is Edelgard's domain, so she has the advantage. It's going to be a tough battle."
16430,"Lorenz: I was taught from a young age to believe that the creed of Seiros was just the way of the world. To question it never even occurred to me. But Claude and Edelgard are different. They challenge the common wisdom. Even defy it. It is uncomfortable to discard familiar assumptions. But that is an essential quality of the visionary. Indeed, true greatness must lie beyond common sense. Hmm, that's good. I should write that down."
16431,Raphael: We're heading up to Enbarr next. I hope I make it back safe so I can tell my little sis about it! I hear they got a neat opera house there where Manuela used to perform. What was it called again?

16439,"Raphael: My little sis always goes on about how much she'd like to see 'em perform. I know we can't see a show, but do you think we could at least see the building?"
16440,"Ignatz: We're about to put the finishing touches on this war. I wonder how Fódlan will look without the backdrop of death and destruction. I can't wait to see it! On the other hand, I'm terrified of what the future might hold. Who knows if I'll survive the assault on the capital?"
16441,"Lysithea: Invading the capital and smashing the Empire. I wonder if doing so could really end this war. Care to share your thoughts, Professor?"
16442,"Byleth:

16448,"Marianne:If we can win this war, then Claude will be the king of Fódlan, and… Maybe he'll tear down the wall that separates Fódlan from the outside world."

Choice 2: Perhaps he won't."
16450,Choice 1: Perhaps he will. (Relationship with Marianne up)
16451,Choice 2: Perhaps he won't.
16452,Marianne: I know it's hard to imagine… But I really hope he does. It would be so much better if people could live together instead of apart. I might even be able to live an ordinary life in the world Claude envisions…
16453,"Hilda: Fighting in the capital! Ugh! And we're fighting against Edelgard! Double ugh! But with you leading us, Professor, I know we'll win. Yeah! Wahoo! Fighting! I'm a little scared, to be honest. I'm just shouting to relieve the tension, but I'll be fine."
16454,"Leonie: We're finally going to the capital. This will be my chance to avenge Captain Jeralt. Once we smash the Empire, I'm sure his soul will finally be able to rest in peace."
16455,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think you're right. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: Who can say for sure?"
16456,Choice 1: I think you're right. (Relationship with Leonie up)
16457,Choice 2: Who can say for sure?
16458,"Leonie: Monica killed Captain Jeralt for the Flame Emperor, and the Flame Emperor was Edelgard. I know that the future of all Fódlan rests on this battle. Nothing else is more important. But for me, this is personal. For Captain Jeralt's sake, I'm going to give it all I've got and more!"
16459,"Ferdinand: Professor. At last, the end is nigh. I love the Empire. Part of me wants it to survive. But I know that is not reasonable. The Empire's time has come. What we need now is a mighty leader who can rebuild Fódlan and rule it as a single nation. Nonetheless, it saddens me that we will not have an Adrestian emperor…"
16460,"Linhardt: They used to call Enbarr the city of Seiros... To assault it, together with the knights, is surreal. If Seiros were alive today, I wonder what she might make of our war... In Enbarr, there was once a Southern Church, and apparently a bishop was dispatched to it. A hundred years ago, the Southern Church became entangled in an insurrection. Until five years ago, the Empire and the church maintained a certain distance from one another."
16461,Caspar: It's such a relief that we've made it this far without having to fight my father.
16462,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You'll have to face him at some point.
Caspar: Hey, don't try and scare me!
Choice 2: It sounds like you're scared. (Relationship with Caspar up)
Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!"

Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!"
16466,Caspar: You bet I'm scared! The Imperial army hasn't lost a single battle with my father on the field!
16467,"Caspar: If he turns up as a reinforcement during the assault, we might lose. I better make my peace with that."
16468,"Bernadetta: Professor! My, um, my mother might be in the city. I don't have many good memories of her if I'm being honest, but she's dearer to me than my father. If you happen to see her, please make sure she's not caught up in all the fighting. She's only a civil servant, so hopefully she takes a cue from her Bernie and stays inside."
16469,"Dorothea: The whole of the capital is going to be a battleground. The city has such a long heritage… Even so, perhaps it deserves to be reduced to ashes for once. But we can’t let the commonfolk get hurt. We should try to confine the damage to the noble section of town."
16470,"Petra: Five years ago...Edelgard said a thing to me. Brigid is a vassal of the Empire. But she also said I always have the freedom to be choosing whether I am with or not with her. I will become the ruler of Brigid. So she said I must make my own path. So now, my path and her path will be colliding."
16471,"Felix: The Death Knight is no ordinary knight. I will prey upon him. I will quench my blade's thirst with his blood. His focus is on fighting you, I'm sure. But mine will be the last face he sees."
16472,Ashe: Those things appeared as soon as we got ourselves set up in Fort Merceus. Think what might have happened if they'd have hit us during the battle at Gronder Field. Assuming it was the work of the Imperial army...
16473,"Sylvain: So Enbarr, the Capital of the Empire. It's finally time. I never thought I'd live this long. It's like any battle, really--stay calm, stay focused. Don't give in to your enemy or your own fear."

Choice 1: You seem more serious than usual.
Sylvain: Hey, I'm always serious! When I'm chasing girls or preparing for battle, always serious. That's me... (continues to below dialogue)

16478,"Sylvain: Striking down the Empire is my offering to His Highness. Heh, I left the Kingdom... What am I saying?"
16479,Mercedes: It's been so long since I've been to the Imperial capital. I used to go to the opera there with my mother and brother. I never thought my return would be like this...
16480,"Annette: Enbarr… Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be returning like this. Of course, most of the nobles in the Empire make their home in the capital. In the Kingdom, all nobles live in their own domains. So if the capital is attacked, it doesn't necessarily affect them directly. What will happen to the Imperial nobles when their capital becomes a battlefield?"
16481,"Ingrid: Once this battle is over, what will become of Faerghus and Fódlan?"
16482,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Peace will reign. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Ingrid: Peace, you say? It sounds so…foreign, so unattainable. But maybe, just maybe.
Choice 2: What would you like to see happen?
Ingrid: My hope is for a world at peace. A world in which this present turmoil is a thing of the past—the stuff of legends."

16487,"Ingrid: I believe those who survive the atrocities of war have a duty to create a new, better world. So the sooner we can stamp out such turmoil, the better. We must win, Professor. There is no alternative here. I won’t allow for anything else."
16488,"Seteth: Rhea will be somewhere in the city. I wonder if she can sense us coming. If we are able to save her, then I expect you will learn many secrets that have hitherto been kept from you. Are you prepared for that?"
16489,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I am. (Relationship with Seteth up)
Seteth: Excellent.
Choice 2: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."

Seteth: Excellent."
16491,Seteth: Excellent.
16492,"Choice 2: I don't think I'm ready yet.
Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."
16493,"Seteth: That is unfortunate. Well, you must become ready."
16494,Seteth: The battle will soon be upon us. Let us both be at our best for what is to come.
16495,"Flayn: I was born in Enbarr. My mother and father met in a church there. Not too long after, I was brought into the world. I do not understand how war can happen in such a precious place. It is most regrettable."
16496,"Hanneman: Enbarr's streets are paved with unhappy memories, Professor. I've avoided the damned place ever since I abandoned my nobility. Swore never to return. Now here we are. To return in this manner... Well, I can't say it is something I ever imagined."
16497,"Manuela: In the opera, actors came and went all the time. But the people behind the scenes would stay forever. I'll bet I'd know a few of them now, even after all these years."
16498,"Alois: Here we are, facing the final battle with the Empire. It's been a long, difficult struggle. We have to get Lady Rhea back! And we have to crush the Empire, in the name of Captain Jeralt. I don't know what comes next. But we can sort out those details later."
16499,Catherine: Looks like we're nearing the end of this struggle. I'm sure Lady Rhea is on tenterhooks waiting for me to swoop in and rescue her.
16500,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Probably. (Relationship with Catherine up)
Catherine: I was just kidding! Pay me no mind.
Choice 2: I doubt it.
Catherine: Oof... You don't mince your words. Try being a bit more mindful of other people's feelings."

16505,"Catherine: Lady Rhea's not waiting for me, I know, no matter how much I might wish she were. She's waiting for you."
16506,"Shamir: Ten years ago, Dagda and Brigid attacked the Empire from the west. The final target was the capital. But they were countered at a port town, long before they reached their destination. I guess our attempt has been more successful than theirs, all things considered."
16507,"Cyril: Whenever I think about how we'll be seeing Lady Rhea real soon, I get happy and really get cleaning! We'll get there for sure, right? We'll see her again?"
16508,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We'll meet her for sure. (Relationship with Cyril up)

16512,"Balthus: Nader the Undefeated… With a name like that, he's bound to put up a damn-good fight. Did you get a good look at Judith? She practically had hearts floating out of her eyeballs when she looked at Nader."
16513,"Byleth:
Choice 1: She must be in love. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: You saw it too? Heh, I know that look well. She's got it bad. Honestly, they'd make a cute couple.
Choice 2: I'm not so sure about that.
Balthus: Pretty dense, aren't ya? Trust me, pal. No one's seen more heart-eyed women than this guy. She's got it bad.
Choice 3: That's ridiculous.

16520,"Balthus: It makes all the sense. Even seasoned warriors aren't immune to love, pal."
16521,"Judith: That Nardel guy... or Nader, I suppose. It was all some trick, and we fell for it. Hmph. I don't think the nickname ""The Undefeated"" applies is he flees from us. Though... maybe he only got that name by running away. Can't be defeated if you run off, right?"
16522,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! Momentum's really picking up for this final battle, huh? Even I'm starting to feel tense! Me! Enbarr's history goes back 1,400 years. That even predates the founding of the Empire. It's one of the sacred sites of the Seiros faith, so it's a pretty big deal. But hey, no need to worry about the monastery while you're fighting the final battle. I've got it covered! I'll defend it to my last!"
16523,"Knight of Seiros: It's very likely that Lady Rhea is confined in the Imperial palace. If so, then our strategy will be to gain control of the streets, and then assault the castle. A street battle followed by a castle invasion... It's just one battle after another. It'll be tough, but we have to win. For Lady Rhea."
16524,"Alliance Knight: Reinforcements from the Alliance are still incoming. Perhaps we can wait... at least until we have an even balance of power. Plenty of supplies have made it through from the Eastern Church and the Merchant's Association in the Alliance. All the people of the Alliance believe we can win, so they're doing everything they can to support us. That means we have to do our best to live up to their expectations!"
16525,"Soldier: The Empire's army should be divided now, with significant troops still in the west. If they don't assert their authority over the old Kingdom's lords, they'll never know when an uprising might start. Ironically, as soon as we capture the Imperial capital, the old Kingdom's lords are likely to rise up immediately."
16526,"Soldier: Cornelia took control of the Kingdom capital, and then founded the Faerghus Dukedom in the old Kingdom territory. Still, Faerghus has remained a mere spectator with regards to our actions so far. It's not so surprising when you consider that they can't even get a handle on the Fraldarius territories."
16527,"Soldier: Of course, the Alliance is making sure that the Five Great Lords help with the effort, but we'll be getting support from the smaller territories too. I'll bet this is the first time those territories have worked so closely together, at least since the founding of the Alliance."
16528,Churchgoer: There are all kinds of rumors about you spreading through the Alliance. Some say you're the new embodiment of Saint Seiros herself! Claude's popularity has certainly risen too. Somewhat...
16529,"Churchgoer: Just recently, the fish in the pond suddenly started thrashing around like mad. I didn't know what was going on, and then I saw something gleaming in the southeastern sky. It happened right when you were out on campaign. I wonder what it could have been..."
16530,"Merchant: With the Empire destroyed, the borders within Fódlan will likely become a thing of the past. With that, the rules of trade will change. Personally, I'm excited to see what these changes will bring!"
16531,"Merchant: Just a few months ago, I thought it was impossible to secure a victory against the Imperial army. But you've shown me miracles can happen after all. I believe that victory is within your grasp!"
16532,"Monk: Did you know? A magnificent canal flows through downtown Enbarr. It's said to have been constructed under the guidance of Saint Seiros before the Empire was even formed. Ever since, that canal has been a major lifeline for the capital's development. And this is how the Empire repays it... Truly, no good deed goes unpunished."
16533,"Yuri: Claude's quite the idealist, isn't he? Not that I've got room to talk. His ambitions are lofty and, well, reckless. One false move, and Fódlan is done for. Although, unrelenting idealism with a dash of recklessness can change the world."
16534,Constance: Destroying the walls that separate Fódlan from the outside world strikes me as a bold step. I've spent so long struggling to reclaim the past that Claude's vision of the future casts me in a poor light. Oh! Did you think I was serious? Ahahaha! As if I would ever admit to a fault. Ensuring that the tradition of House Nuvelle continues uninterrupted is a noble task!
16535,"Hapi: I don't know much about Almyrans, but I guess I have something in common with them. We're viewed as different because of where we came from. There must be a lot of people like us."
16536,"Byleth:
Choice 1: There are a lot. (Relationship with Hapi up)
Hapi: That's what I thought. People from the north, the west, and even some isolated communities within Fódlan.

Hapi: You're not sure? Well, I bet there are."
16540,"Hapi: You're not sure? Well, I bet there are."
16541,"Hapi: And if that's the case, maybe Claudester's got the right idea."
16542,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Remember that battle six years ago? Oh... Um, I'm guessing you do. Anyway, remember that knight who watched over Abyss with me for a while? I've been on the hunt for his whereabouts and... I finally found out what happened to him. My friend...is no longer with us. Dead. Figured as much, but now I know for sure. I did get to meet his big sister, at least. I'll never have the chance to thank him for our time together...but maybe I can find a way to help out his sister instead. Bet he would have liked that."
16543,"Hermit: Those lights that came down on Merceus...I might have seen them before, here at Garreg Mach. They looked like they'd rain down right on top of us, but at the last moment, they veered off... I think they crashed into Ailell. It must have been the goddess's blessing that protected us."
16544,Hilda: We need more resources around here. Please help!
16545,Hilda: We're in dire need of some more supplies. Can you help?
16546,"Hilda:Thanks, Professor! You did a nice job procuring resources for us. Now, here's a little token of my appreciation."
16547,Claude: There it is... Enbarr. The Imperial capital and the largest city in all of Fódlan.
16548,Judith: It's not just big. This city was designed to protect the castle where the emperor lives. It's as though the city itself is a massive stronghold.
16549,"Byleth:
Choice 1: And the citizens?
Choice 2: What is the state of affairs in the town?"
16550,Choice 1: And the citizens?
16551,Choice 2: What is the state of affairs in the town?
16552,"Claude: They surely noticed us approaching some time ago, and yet..."
16553,Shamir: Our scouts confirmed the citizens haven't been evacuated. They're being kept in town.
16554,Claude: I've got to hand it to Her Imperial Majesty. Using her citizens as a shield to protect the castle takes some resolve.
16555,Lysithea: I suspect those mages will be lurking within as well...
16556,Shamir: Troops deployed to other areas are also returning.
16557,"Judith: If we don't conquer the city quickly, things will get complicated fast."
16558,Byleth: I hope we find Rhea...
16559,Seteth: We can't search until we conquer the city. Let's focus on the fight for now.
16560,"Cyril: Lady Rhea, please be safe."
16561,Claude: We've kept the Empire waiting long enough. Onward!

16567,"Claude: We were told Hubert would be leading the enemy forces, but the Death Knight's also with them. We'll have to take care of both of them, but we won't have time to mop up all the enemy units. We'll have to split up and take them on at the same time, or risk being overrun by their reinforcements."
16568,Imperial Soldier: It's here! The Crest of Flames banner! There! On the other side of the canal!
16569,"Hubert: Uninvited guests, I see. Heh. Let's ensure they receive a warm welcome. Ready the artillery. Prepare to attack. Rocks, arrows, magic - rain death upon the enemy until they are silent as the grave. Reinforcements will fly in shortly. Defend the heavy weapons until they arrive. (Ballista, Onager, and Fire Orb are shown on the map, occupied by enemy units)"
16570,Hubert: Our first wave of reinforcements is here. It will not be long until the next.
16571,Claude: Reinforcements?! That was quick... We can't hang around or they'll just keep coming. We'll have to capture the artillery. We can turn them against their reinforcements...
16572,Hubert: We have reinforcements coming in from another direction. Deploy them as soon as they arrive.
16573,Claude: OK! Just Hubert left to deal with...
16574,Hubert: We are taking heavy losses. We need more troops...
16575,"Claude: Well done, everyone! Now we can break through into Enbarr! We need to hurry up and attack the palace to block Edelgard's movements!"
16576,"Claude: It's over, lapdog. Your military rule is at its end."
16577,"Hubert: For every step you take along that path, our thorns will cut into your heels."""
16578,"Claude: Ooh, that sounds painful. I'll have to wear thicker soles for the march."
16579,"Hubert: If your boots are too heavy, you won't be able to lift your feet. But enough prattle."
16580,"Hubert: Running into you in the capital like this-I have to say, it's almost sentimental."
16581,Ferdinand: Hubert. She must leave.
16582,Hubert: You really think you can make her?
16583,Ferdinand: It does not matter what I think. Those are my orders.
16584,Death Knight: So much has been taken... It is not even. Time to kill...(If the Death Knight was not defeated)
16585,"Seteth: You will not escape, Death Knight. Today you will be unmasked!"
16586,Death Knight: My true identity has no value.
16587,"Seteth: I will be the judge of that, once I've seen your face."
16588,"Flayn: So it's you, Death Knight! Remember me?!"
16589,Death Knight: You again. Here to lose more blood?
16590,Flayn: Never! You will not lay a hand on me ever again!
16591,"Claude: Hey, how long's it been? Five years? Who'd have thought you'd end up an Imperial general..."
16592,"Death Knight: So, you wish to die."
16593,"Claude: Heh. As antisocial and unhinged as ever, I see."
16594,"Mercedes: I came here to get you! Let's return together, Emile!"
16595,Death Knight: Leave! The place of your death is not here!
16596,Claude: We've made it this far... Somehow. Edelgard is probably looking down on us from somewhere in that castle.
16597,Leonie: I wonder if she's panicking or just smiling smugly...
16598,"Claude: From this point on, she'll be giving it her all too. Expect her to be tougher than the last time we fought. This battle will settle things once and for all. We'll attack as soon as everyone is ready."
16599,"Claude: Huh? Is that you, Dedue?!"
16600,Dedue: I heard the Alliance's army has entered the city. I've been searching for you ever since.
16601,"Byleth:

16606,"Claude: Well, if you want to fight alongside us, we'd be more than happy to have you."
16607,"Dedue: We fight for different objectives. I swore to offer Edelgard's head to His Highness. But... Should I fail, I will have no choice but to entrust that mission to you. This is the information I have gathered during my time in hiding here. It includes details about the inside of the castle."
16608,"Claude: I appreciate this, but... What do you plan to do? Don't tell me you plan to do alone?"
16609,Dedue: I've done what I came here to do. Farewell.
16610,Claude: Hey! Wait! He's gone. He's just as hard to understand as his liege was.
16611,"Claude: The time has finally come, my friend. Once we win this fight, the Empire will fall..."
16612,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What will become of Fódlan?
Claude: What will become of it? Well, that's for us to decide, isn't it?

Claude: The subject is heavy on my mind."
16613,"Choice 1: What will become of Fódlan?

Claude: The subject is heavy on my mind."
16616,Claude: The subject is heavy on my mind.
16617,"Claude: Odd as it sounds, I believe the forces responsible for destroying Fódlan are also responsible for protecting the livelihood of its citizens. Everything, even the land itself, has been harmed by the chaos of war. Restoring it will be no easy feat. To do that, the first thing we need to think about is a new ruling system for all of Fódlan."
16618,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Alliance lords could divide the territory.
Claude: No, I don't think that would work. The western half of the continent has little connection to the Alliance. Any attempt to force dominion on them would breed rebellion. The world would slide back into war once again.
Choice 2: We could unify Fódlan as one nation.
Claude: As usual, we're on the same page. I was thinking the same thing."
16619,"Choice 1: The Alliance lords could divide the territory.

Claude: As usual, we're on the same page. I was thinking the same thing."
16622,"Claude: As usual, we're on the same page. I was thinking the same thing."
16623,Claude: Even if the Alliance lords and any remaining influential nobles were to divide up dominion of all of Fódlan... They would simply pursue their own interests. Another war would be inevitable. That's why there needs to be a powerful ruler who stands above them all and unifies Fódlan as one nation.
16624,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You should be that ruler, Claude.
Claude: If it means I can lead Fódlan to a better future, I wouldn't mind that at all.
Choice 2: We must search for a new ruler.
Claude: A new ruler, huh? I think I've got someone in mind.
Choice 3: I should be that ruler.
Claude: (Disappointed) My friend... Do you really mean that?"
16625,"Choice 1: You should be that ruler, Claude.

16630,Claude: (Disappointed) My friend... Do you really mean that?
16631,"Claude: My dreams await in a future where Fódlan is no longer ravaged by war. There are things I want to see with you some day. I'll keep thinking about the best way to achieve that goal. Whatever we decide to do, we can't do it until we defeat the Empire. Fódlan can't welcome a new dawn until we win the war. Let's prepare as best we can."

16644,"Claude: She's a fellow student to all of us. If there's a path that we can walk together, that would be preferable. But that all depends on Edelgard. If she won't yield, then that's that. If showing pity would put my allies in danger, I will not hesitate to kill her. I ask that you and everyone here prepare yourselves to do the same."
16645,Lysithea: Understood. I think I speak for everyone when I say that we are prepared.

16647,Leonie: Captain Jeralt taught me that indecisiveness is a weakness. One must cast aside their doubts before fighting.
16648,Flayn: The lives of Lady Rhea and everyone here are more important than all else. I shall be prepared.
16649,"Raphael: You know what? I wouldn't be surprised if she took one look at my overstuffed muscles and surrendered in tears, then and there!"
16650,Ignatz: I really hope that Edelgard will yield...
16651,Hilda: Edelgard is a stubborn one. I don't think she's likely to surrender.
16652,Marianne: Goddess... Please protect us...
16653,Cyril: I...I'll fight with all I got to save Lady Rhea!
16654,"Seteth: Rescuing Lady Rhea is my dearest wish. We must prevail, no matter what it takes."
16655,"Alois: In the name of the Knights of Seiros, we'll bring the hammer down on the Imperial army!"
16656,"Judith: Satisfied yet, boy? Everyone made up their minds a long time ago."
16657,"Claude: OK. Let's get started. We're yours to command, my friend."
16658,Byleth: Leave it to me.
16659,"Claude: Everyone, take your positions! The battle is upon us!"
16660,Victory Conditions: Defeat the enemy commander.
16661,"Defeat Conditions:
(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
(Classic Mode) Byleth or Claude fall in battle."
16662,(Casual Mode) All of your units fall in battle.
16663,(Classic Mode) Byleth or Claude fall in battle.
16664,"Edelgard: They've made it into the palace, but it's actually the perfect chance to turn the tables on them. Defeating them all will turn the tide of war instantly. Taking a risk on dragging us back from the brink is the only option. Everyone! Prepare for a bitter struggle! Victory to the Adrestian Empire!"
16665,"Claude: There are more enemies inside the palace than I thought. It's gonna take a lot to bring this situation under control. But, if we defeat Edelgard, then victory is ours! Everyone, let's go!"
16666,Claude: Our bashful little emperor has locked herself up behind the door of the throne room. The key should be around here somewhere. We need to find whoever's got it and take them out.
16667,Petra: We must be protecting the throne room! You will not be getting past!
16668,Dorothea: Stay back! I'll protect Edie with my life!
16669,Claude: We'll have to take out one of them if we're going to advance... Petra seems like the shortest route...
16670,Claude: I wonder how Dedue is doing... I hope I get to see him again.
16671,Dedue: So close... Must press on...
16672,Imperial Soldier: Infiltrators! Kill them!
16673,"Edelgard: I must confess I never imagined that you would be able to pursue me this far. I don't mean to belittle your skills, Professor, but you've far surpassed my expectations. Inform the troops! Destroy anyone who sets foot in the throne room!"
16674,Claude: We should be able to get through to the throne room now...
16675,"Claude: This should give us a bit more freedom of movement. Now, how best to attack..."
16676,Claude: We did it! The enemy won't be able to send any more reinforcements now.
16677,Edelgard: Clever tactic. It's going to be difficult to turn the tables now.
16678,Shamir: I cannot bring myself to kill you... You're a princess of Brigid. A hostage of the Empire.
16679,"Petra: That was the truth in the past, but it is a different truth now, Shamir... I am...the will of the emperor!"
16680,"Shamir: In that case, I won't hold back."
16681,Dorothea: Manuela? It's not like you to show up anywhere sober. What's the occasion?
16682,Manuela: I thought maybe we could talk. I could help you see the error of your ways. Or we could just try to kill each other over what we believe in. You ready to do this?
16683,Dorothea: No... But let's get to it.
16684,"Dedue: I cannot vanquish her alone. So I will join you in this battle. But if I fall, leave me. My only wish is for Edelgard's head."
16685,"Edelgard: Your ideals, I understand they're not so far removed from my own. But without sufficient knowledge of this land's suffering, I can't entrust Fódlan to you!"
16686,"Claude: Perhaps. I daresay it's true that I don't fully understand the history of Fódlan. Still, I've seen many things in my life. Don't worry. I'll finish the job for you."
16687,Flayn: Edelgard! Please! Release Rhea... Release Fódlan!
16688,"Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people!"
16689,Edelgard: Lysithea. You and I are so alike. We could have walked the same path.
16690,Lysithea: We're alike? You don't mean to tell me... It can't be!
16691,"Edelgard: Yet now, we are at a crossroads. There's no turning back. Must we fight each other for the things we believe in!"
16692,"Lysithea: That's exactly what's going to happen. And I will defeat you, Edelgard."
16693,Seteth: Edelgard! Return Rhea! Release your grip on Fódlan!
16694,"Edelgard: If you strike me down, they will return. I cannot permit what you desire. You are a child of the goddess. You must not be allowed power over the people."
16695,Constance: What use are words? We are both set on our path.
16696,Edelgard: How predictable. But so be it. I will now show you my true power!
16697,Edelgard: This has nothing do to with where you were born. That we are fighting now is only a result of the choices you've made. So I'm going to give that the response it deserves. I will crush you with everything I have!
16698,"Claude: Edelgard, give up! We don't want to kill you!"
16699,"Edelgard: But... I must kill you. If I don't, the righteous world I dream of will never see the light. Come at me with everything you have. For one of us, this is the end!"
16700,Edelgard: It looks as though... my path... will end here.
16701,Edelgard: My teacher... claim your victory.
16702,Edelgard: Strike me down. You must!
16703,"Edelgard: Even now... across this land, people are killing each other. If you do not act now, this conflict... will go on forever."
16704,Edelgard: Your path... lies across my grave. It is time for you to find the courage to walk it.
16705,Edelgard: If I must fall... let it be by your hand.
16706,Edelgard: I wanted... to walk with you...
16707,Claude: It's over. We were only able to beat her because of you.
16708,Byleth: (Heartbroken expression) ...
16709,Claude: This wasn't the conclusion I had hoped for. Even though... I... Never mind. It's over now. The important thing is that we won.
16710,"Judith: Here, boy. A letter. An Imperial general asked me to give it to you."
16711,Claude: A letter? Let's see it.
16712,Claude: It looks like it's from... Hubert. Edelgard's vassal.
16713,"Hubert: If you are reading this letter, that means I have perished. As Her Majesty would never surrender to another, I can only assume she has fallen as well. It greatly pains me to think of this coming to pass... That said, as the survivors, I must ask you to settle certain affairs in our stead. You must destroy the threat that slithers in the dark. I am sure you must recall Monica and Tomas. Their allies yet live. They hold deep resentment against the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and they are biding their time until they can exact revenge. If left to their own devices, it is certain they will eventually bring unimaginable calamity and suffering to the world. I detected their sorcery when you took Fort Merceus. I have deduced the location of their stronghold, Shambhala. You will find its whereabouts enclosed. There is no question that they are the enemies of everyone in Fódlan. Do not allow yourselves to forget that. Lastly... While I cannot say she is in good health, the archbishop resides in a secret chamber in the Imperial palace. I have shared the location of the entrance to that secret chamber with the person to whom I have entrusted this letter. I believe that Her Majesty will be victorious... Even still, I must plan for her defeat as well. If you wish to lead this world, I challenge you to rise to the occasion and surpass my estimation of you. Such is your obligation as the victors... and the only fitting tribute to all that Lady Edelgard sacrificed."
16714,"Claude: Hubert... To leave a letter like this behind... You were a better man than I believed you to be. So, Rhea is alive. And the fight isn't over yet. Those who slither in the dark... It sounds like Fódlan will never know peace unless we defeat them."
16715,"Claude: The allies of Monica and Tomas... Well, we knew about them already. I think it's safe to assume this is the same group who used Lysithea for their blood experiments. And they were also responsible for the javelins of light that destroyed the fortress. But who are these ""children of the goddess,"" who they supposedly resent? There's just not enough information here. I don't suppose there's any chance of his idea of a prank... If so, wow. Good one. Hubert... Rather than writing a letter, you should have just told us before we fought..."
16716,Byleth: Let's ask Rhea about it.
16717,Claude: Right. We still don't know for sure if this letter is telling the truth. Let's go find out.
16718,Rhea: You... You have come to save me... Is this... Is this a dream? I have longed to see you again... all this time... Is it truly you?
16719,"Rhea: Claude... I can see you have grown into a reliable young man... Thank you for supporting the professor, and for rescuing me. Surely the protection of the goddess has-"
16720,"Claude: Wait, Rhea. What do you know about the children of the goddess?"
16721,Rhea: Children of... What is this about?
16722,Claude: Forgive my bluntness. Someone from the Empire filled us in on a few things. I know it must be painful for us to ask you difficult questions after such an arduous confinement. But we have no choice. We must defeat a secret enemy... Those who slither in the dark. Do you know about them?
16723,Rhea: Those who slither in the dark...
16724,"Claude: Apparently, they resent the children of the goddess and the people of the world, and are planning something big. Something terrible."
16725,Rhea: ...
16726,"Claude: They use blood for their wicked magic and are capable of dropping javelins of light from the sky, which are powerful enough to crush a fortress. If you can think of anything at all, please tell us now. We need to know as much as possible about these enemies in order to stop them."
16727,Rhea: ...
16728,Claude: This is the critical moment that will determine whether or not Fódlan falls! Can't you see that the time for secrets has passed?!
16729,Rhea: It is true that there is a group of people who have slithered in the darkness and threatened the peace of Fódlan since ancient times. I am sure you have heard the stories of a man named Nemesis...
16730,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The King of Liberation...
Choice 2: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator..."
16731,Choice 1: The King of Liberation...
16732,Choice 2: The wielder of the Sword of the Creator...
16733,"Claude: Nemesis, the King of Liberation. He's the hero to whom the goddess gave the Sword of the Creator."
16734,"Rhea: Nemesis was originally the leader of a group of bandits. He plundered the Holy Tomb and stole the remains of the progenitor god. When Nemesis appeared in Zanado some time later, he already wielded the Sword of the Creator."
16735,"Byleth:
Choice 1: In Zanado?
Claude: Zanado, the Red Canyon...
Choice 2: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Claude: According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods."
16736,"Choice 1: In Zanado?
Claude: Zanado, the Red Canyon..."
16737,"Claude: Zanado, the Red Canyon..."
16738,"Choice 2: How did he get the Sword of the Creator?
Claude: According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods."
16739,"Claude: According to legend, the goddess gifted him the sword to fight against the evil gods."
16740,"Rhea: I do not know how Nemesis obtained the sword, or why he appeared in Zanado. But he used that sword to massacre the people there. The children of the progenitor god. From their corpses he gained even more power, and brought war to Fódlan..."
16741,Claude: That's completely different from what the legends tell us about Nemesis.
16742,Rhea: A mere bandit like Nemesis would not have been capable of anything so monstrous on his own...
16743,"Claude: Aha! So Nemesis had accomplices. And those accomplices must have been those who slither in the dark. They used Nemesis! And this time they used the Imperial army to once again bring war to Fódlan! I finally get it... And I even understand why Edelgard was associating with them. Just as they were trying to use the Empire, the Empire was trying to use them. Rhea, there's still a mountain of things I need to ask you. And I will. But I'll leave all of that for another day. You must be weak after living in confinement for so long. Please rest for a while. My friend... Let's prepare for battle. We need to strike Shambhala as soon as possible."
16744,Rhea: You must not allow Fódlan's bloody history... the Red Canyon Tragedy... to repeat itself...
16745,Claude: Hm. It occurred to me that we never got an answer from Rhea about the children of the goddess.
16746,Byleth: Aren't they the people of Zanado?
16747,"Claude: She did say that the people of the Red Canyon were the children of the progenitor god, so I suppose so. But those evil guys continue to plot their revenge even after the Red Canyon Tragedy. Does that mean some of the children of the goddess, or their descendants, are still alive?"
16748,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Rhea?
Claude: Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself.
Choice 2: Flayn?
Claude: If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility.
Choice 3: Me?
Claude: Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether."
16749,"Choice 1: Rhea?
Claude: Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself."
16750,Claude: Could be. She was talking about what happened in Zanado as if she was there herself.
16751,"Choice 2: Flayn?
Claude: If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility."
16752,"Claude: If there's something special about her blood, we can't rule out the possibility."
16753,"Choice 3: Me?
Claude: Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether."
16754,Claude: Huh. Maybe? Though I get the feeling you're something else altogether.
16755,"Claude: What are these children anyway? And how are they connected to the goddess? Bah! I almost disappeared into the bottomless swamp that is my mind. I thought that after we defeated the Empire, I'd be able to see that sight I long to see.."
16756,Byleth: What sight is that?
16757,"Claude: I've told you about my dreams before... I want to break down the wall separating Fódlan from the outside world. The sight I want to see lies beyond that. Honestly, it's a trivial thing to fixate on. Just people, gathered in their towns. Living our their lives together. Sometimes laughing. Sometimes fighting. But the people living there aren't just citizens of Fódlan. They are people from Dagda, Brigid, and even Duscur and Sreng. There could be people who were born in Almyra or countries even farther east there too.. All of those people living together, like it's nothing special at all. That's the sight I long to see. It's so simple, but still so far away... But this is no time for complaining. We need to focus on capturing Shambhala. Let's hurry up and gather everyone together."
16758,Judith: So... you mean to tell me that Fódlan will fall to ruin if we leave those guys be?
16759,"Hilda: Um, if this map is reliable, their base is just south of my family's territory."
16760,Lorenz: This story is a bit much to believe... And yet...
16761,Leonie: It does ring true somehow.
16762,"Claude: Remember Monica, the one who killed Jeralt? And the old man who was masquerading as Tomas? They were their allies. And the Flame Emperor and the Death Knight were merely their pawns."
16763,Flayn: The people who were after my blood?!
16764,Lysithea: They were also the ones who used me to conduct their blood experiments...
16765,"Claude: As awful as it sounds, they're seemingly fond of using blood in their secret techniques."
16766,Hilda: Eww! That's really gross! I could never be friends with someone like that.
16767,Claude: I believe they were also responsible for the javelin of light that destroyed Fort Merceus.
16768,"Judith: Hold up, boy. Do you really think that we can win against such powerful foes?"
16769,"Claude: I don't know. But we have to try, don't we?"
16770,"Byleth:
Choice 1: This is for Fódlan's future.
Hilda: We've really taken on something big. I wonder if our names will go down in history.
Lorenz: My heroic name? Passed down to future generations? Haha! A worthy cause indeed.
Choice 2: It's our responsibility as the victors.
Hilda: Since Edelgard can't do it, I guess it falls to us.
Claude: They were trying to use the Imperial army to plunge Fódlan into war, but we nipped that in the bud. Now we just need to tear our their roots. And I know we have what it takes to do it."
16771,"Choice 1: This is for Fódlan's future.

16780,"Immediately following Edelgard's defeat, the Alliance army discovers the existence of another adversary - a group operating behind the scenes within the Empire. Claude suspects that if the true enemy is left unchecked, disaster will befall Fódlan. And so he cuts short the celebration, and the troops head for Shambhala, where this foe resides.

"
16788,Claude: I just don't get it...
16789,"Leonie: What is it, Claude?"
16790,"Claude: Those javelins of light... They were trying to use it to kill us at Fort Merceus, right? But then why not drop it on Garreg Mach? They must have known for a while that we were here."
16791,"Rhea: It is not that they chose to refrain, but rather that they were unable to do so."
16792,Claude: Rhea! How are you feeling?
16793,Rhea: I am well enough... I cannot afford to rest while Fódlan is in danger.
16794,Claude: What do you mean when you say they couldn't drop a javelin of light here?
16795,"Rhea: Once, a very long time ago, a massive ball of light fell upon this monastery. However, that light mysteriously changed course in mid-air and landed in Ailell instead."
16796,"Leonie: Ailell, the Valley of Torment... So that's what the wreckage of those javelins of light looks like."
16797,"Rhea: The Holy Tomb is not only the location of the progenitor god's eternal slumber, but also a sacred vessel for a power that repels evil. Supposedly, the progenitor god built the Holy Tomb herself to protect her children from the evil light."
16798,Claude: So the children of the goddess gathered in Zanado because of its proximity to the monastery? But we've fought at distant locations many times.
16799,"Leonie: Despite that, the javelins of light only fell on Fort Merceus."
16800,"Judith: In his letter, Hubert said that he detected their magic when the fort fell. In other words, because they used a javelin of light, Hubert was able to pinpoint the location of their base."
16801,Leonie: So they didn't use it before then because they didn't want us to know where their base is?
16802,"Claude: In any case, those javelins of light must be something they can't just use whenever they want. And they finally decided to use one at Merceus, where they were sure they'd be able to finish us off. It's only thanks to the whims of the Death Knight that we escaped with our lives. And no javelins of light have fallen since then."
16803,Judith: It's possible that the enemy hasn't yet realized that we've learned the location of their base.
16804,"Claude: If so, their guard may be down, which makes this the perfect time for a surprise attack."
16805,Rhea: I will accompany you.
16806,"Seteth: What?! No! That would be far too dangerous! Your long confinement weakened you greatly, did it not?"
16807,Rhea: Those people have opposed us since ancient times. I wish to learn the truth about them for myself.
16808,"Seteth: I... I understand. I will not stop you, but please take care not to overexert yourself."
16809,"Claude: We don't know exactly what we're up against here, but having you around is very reassuring, Rhea. Let's prepare to strike at Shambhala before they make their next move!"
16810,"Claude: We crushed the Empire at long last... But there's no time to bask in our victory. We must prepare for the coming battle. We knew there was a secret group behind the Imperial army all this time. Now, we have a chance to make the first move against them. We have Hubert to thank for that. It's also thanks to him that we were able to rescue Rhea. I still have plenty of questions I'd like to ask her."
16811,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Are you going to see her?
Claude: Well, if we plan to have her march into battle with us again, we'd better let her recuperate.
Choice 2: We should let her rest.

16816,"Lorenz: A mysterious power, threatening the very future of Fódlan? Certainly we cannot give it leeway. In comparison to this, the internal power struggles in the Alliance are utterly trivial."
16817,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Aren't you frightened? (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Lorenz: Fear will serve no purpose here. The only path to survival is victory.
Choice 2: Do you think we can defeat it?

16837,"Lysithea: Those who slither in the dark... It seems we'll finally discover their true form. I get the sense that they're in league with the mages who experimented on me as a child. I wouldn't be surprised if Edelgard was subjected to them too. There's no telling what their true motives are. But whatever their motives, what they have done is unforgivable. They must be exterminated."
16838,"Marianne: I thought the war would end with Edelgard's defeat... But that wasn't the case. This may be premature, but I'm feeling a little relieved. I have to consider what I'll do with myself and where I'll go when this war is finally over... I don't have an answer yet... Let's make sure the next battle puts an end to this war. That way we can all move forward!"
16839,"Hilda: ""Shambhala"" it was called, right? Scary that it's so close to the House Goneril territories. Who'd have thought all those creeps were living right under my nose? I was hoping my big brother would help us in this next battle. But he says that I can represent House Goneril without his help. That I have it in me. I'm glad he recognizes that I have some ability. Still, I wish he wasn't leaving it all to me."
16840,"Leonie: These are Monica's people, aren't they? The ones who killed Captain Jeralt. Then this is my real opportunity for revenge. There's no way I can back down from this one."

Leonie: No, I'm OK. Actually, I'm eager to get our there and fight. This is what I've been training for.
Choice 2: I wonder if we can win.
Leonie: If we lose, it's the end for Fódlan. So we have to win, even if it kills us."

16846,"Ferdinand: The history of the Empire spans 1185 years. And just like that, it ends. But the Hresvelg legacy could live on... When Edelgard assumed power, there were no other rightful heirs. She said that whoever takes the throne next should do so by virtue of merit, not blood. And she truly meant what she said. At any rate, I feel that a huge hole has opened up in my heart. Who knows if it can ever be filled?"
16847,"Linhardt: As history proves, everything comes to an end eventually. I knew that all along, but it still came as a surprise. Those who slither in the dark... It's all so fascinating and strange. They must certainly have a long history of their own. And when they fall, that will come quickly too. Don't you think? Heh, that almost sounded like a prophecy there. Am I spooking you yet?"
16848,"Caspar: He's dead... My father's dead... I'm OK though. Really. I was ready for it. He was a general in the Imperial army, after all. Minister of Military Affairs... He gave his own life so the Empire's soldiers wouldn't have to lose theirs. That's a fight that only he could take on. He was such a tough guy. This whole time I fought side by side with you and Claude... But did I ever get any stronger? Will I ever be as strong as my father?"
16849,"Bernadetta: With Edelgard gone, maybe Fódlan will finally find some peace. That's all well and good, but, um... She was also the one to put my father under house arrest, so now he's been released, and he's taken charge of House Varley. I can't handle it! I can't deal with him! Please, you have to do something!"
16850,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How about we exile him? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
Choice 2: We can put him back under arrest."
16851,Choice 1: How about we exile him? (Relationship with Bernadetta up)
16852,Choice 2: We can put him back under arrest.
16853,Bernadetta: Thank you so much!
16854,"Dorothea: So, the moment we defeat Edie, the nobles cozy up to the Alliance and church... That lot really does think only of themselves, and no one else. But then there's Count Bergliez. He used to be Minister of Military Affairs... He sacrificed his own life so that all the soldiers and officers who fought could be given quarter... When I heard that... I don't know... that simple act of humanity... I couldn't help it. I burst into tears. You know Count Bergliez is Casper's father, right? I can't even imagine how Caspar must feel about it."
16855,Petra: The Empire has broken in... in smithereens. Now it is possible for me to go back to Brigid. But... I cannot choose that choice. The time is still too soon for that. We must be stopping the evil for everyone in Fódlan. We will be fighting until the end of it!
16856,"Felix: I thought that after the Empire fell, the boar might finally be avenged... But something dark is certainly lurking in the shadows - an organization behind the Empire. We'll have to take care of them if the boar... if Dimitri is to rest in peace."
16857,"Ashe: We've all heard the legend of Nemesis, the King of Liberation. But now Lady Rhea is saying Nemesis was just some kind of thief. Those two descriptions are totally at odds. Which version's correct? I don't know what to think. But I guess that's the nature of history. I wonder what the generations that come after us will say about the battle we're about to fight."
16858,"Sylvain: This war might be over but not war in general. Human beings thrive on conflict. We can't get enough of it. I don't know when, but you know someday another war will begin."
16859,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Even so... (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?
Choice 2: You're probably right about that.
Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it."
16860,"Choice 1: Even so... (Relationship with Sylvain up)
Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?"
16861,"Sylvain: Heh heh... That's the way it is, right?"
16862,"Choice 2: You're probably right about that.
Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it."
16863,"Sylvain: Yeah, but the fight is still worth it."
16864,Sylvain: War may always come back but so will peace. And peace is what we fight for.
16865,Mercedes: Lady Rhea still seems weak... but at least she's safe now. I'm praying that she'll be well as soon as possible. Goddess... I beg you... Protect Lady Rhea!
16866,"Annette: Finally, that awful war is over. Everyone lost something, and everyone had to make sacrifices... But maybe we can put a stop to all of this pain and loss now. Let's hurry to Shambhala, Professor! We have to defeat them if we ever want to see a world without war."
16867,"Ingrid: Is it really prudent to bring Lady Rhea on our upcoming expedition? It would be best not to have her doing anything strenuous, considering how long she was confined..."
16868,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's her decision, ultimately. (Relationship with Ingrid up)
Choice 2: I feel similarly."
16869,"Choice 1: It's her decision, ultimately. (Relationship with Ingrid up)"
16870,Choice 2: I feel similarly.
16871,Ingrid: There are still many in Fódlan who are seeking Lady Rhea's salvation.
16872,"Seteth: Rhea is sleeping right now. If it is not absolutely urgent, please do not disturb her rest. The long confinement took its toll on her health. Truthfully, she is in no shape to be exerting herself at all – to say nothing of a military expedition. To make matters worst, we are now facing a very old enemy. One that has conspired against us since time out of mind. Please proceed with caution. I have a bad feeling."
16873,"Flayn: I am so glad that Rhea is unharmed. My brother continues to worry about her, however. Of course, I am worried myself. I cannot imagine being in that situation while in such a state... She should just leave things to you and Claude and get the rest she needs..."
16874,"Hanneman: A mysterious organization, slithering in the dark of Fódlan... Like something out of a midnight tale. It appears these fiends have infiltrated the deepest corners of the Empire. After the fall of Enbarr, they've remained well concealed... That said, I would keep an eye on Edelgard's uncle, Lord Arundel. Something about him sits ill with me."
16875,"Manuela: Professor! Most of the opera company fled, but they’re back in the capital now. I don’t know if everyone survived, but it looks like they should be able to mount a revival. They even asked if I’d consider making a return to the stage someday... I suspect I may refuse though. We’re at the dawn of something new. No reason to look backwards, eh?"
16876,"Alois: You've done it. You did it. You crushed the Empire, and rescued Lady Rhea. I'm sure the captain is proud of you right now. As am I, of course! I'm as proud as if I'd done it myself!"
16877,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's not celebrate just yet. (Relationship with Alois up)
Choice 2: We still have opponents left to fight."
16878,Choice 1: Let's not celebrate just yet. (Relationship with Alois up)
16879,Choice 2: We still have opponents left to fight.
16880,Alois: Sorry. I didn't mean to overdo it. We still have Monica's group… Those who killed the captain. We'll knock 'em down so hard that they can't get back up!
16881,"Catherine: We rescued Lady Rhea! I can hardly express my joy. But now we know about a new foe, who intends to bring her harm. In time, we'll realize the peaceful world that Lady Rhea has always hoped for. I'll have to keep that in mind when I'm fighting."
16882,Shamir: We saved Rhea and the Empire has crumbled. The Kingdom may as well be finished too. The reasons for me to remain in Fódlan are fading.
16883,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Please, stay with us a little longer. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
Choice 2: Is it time to bid farewell?
Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end."
16884,"Choice 1: Please, stay with us a little longer. (Relationship with Shamir up)
Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end."
16885,Shamir: Of course. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
16886,"Choice 2: Is it time to bid farewell?
Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end."
16887,Shamir: That's a little hasty. I've come this far. May as well see it through to the end.
16888,"Cyril: Lady Rhea’s back! Lady Rhea’s back! I’m so happy! But... things aren’t gonna be like they used to be any time soon, are they? There’s still folks out there who want us all dead, and Lady Rhea still hasn’t regained her strength yet. Speaking of which, Professor, please don’t ask too much of her right now, OK?"
16889,"Judith: The folks we're fighting next aren't normal humans, are they? It's that group who caused the javelin of light to fall, right? It just doesn't seem like something a human is capable of. I'm not prone to flinching, but I don't feel great about any of this..."
16890,"Gatekeeper: Greetings, Professor! Nothing to report! I can hardly believe you managed to handle the capital city like that. Everyone did sterling work! I really thought we'd know peace after the battle. But we're not quite there yet, huh?"
16891,"Knight of Seiros: Fighting against enemies whose true nature is unknown is honestly really scary. Still... If there's a force in this world that clearly means us harm, we have no choice but to fight back. With our own hands, we'll safeguard Fódlan's future!"
16892,Knight of Seiros: We finally got Lady Rhea back from the Empire and fulfilled our mission. I wish we could afford for her to have a good long rest... But that just isn't possible.
16893,Soldier: Dedue saw to it that Edelgard was destroyed before he departed. His expression once his mission was over... was a bit lonely. I don't know where he went off to after that. Maybe he returned home to Duscur.
16894,"Soldier: I can still see Dedue‘s struggled when I close my eyes... I don’t know why he was so bent on destroying Edelgard... Now that we’ve completed our mission, I can only pray that his soul is accepted into heaven to rest in peace."
16895,"Soldier: We won against the Imperial army! I still can't believe it! But I guess we still have some enemies left? I'm not well informed, but I have plenty of fighting spirit!"
16896,Soldier: I thought that taking the Empire's capital would bring an end to this war... How naive of me. I'll have to write to my family and tell them I'll be gone a while longer...
16897,"Churchgoer: I heard that Lady Rhea's back! But why hasn't she shown herself to everyone yet? Oh, she's convalescing? Fair enough. She was in captivity for a long time. I pray she feels better soon."
16898,Churchgoer: So Lady Rhea was all right after all! Well done bringing her back safely! Simply magnificent! Hm? You're saying the fight isn't over yet?
16899,"Merchant: Count Bergliez, the Minister of Military Affairs, was applying pressure in the west, but he surrendered after the Empire fell. Cornelia of the Faerghus Dukedom seems to have disappeared from the palace... and rather swiftly. They must have realized that the revival of the old Kingdom was a real threat."
16900,"Merchant: You did it! I never thought I'd live to see the day that the Empire was conquered! I thought that would put an end to the war, but I hear there are still hostile forces to contend with. I hope you'll be able to put an end to this conflict, and found a new Fódlan in which the free market can thrive!"
16901,"Monk: We have succeeded at rescuing Lady Rhea, but Seteth's countenance remains clouded… When will peaceful days return to this monastery? That time feels so distant…"
16902,Yuri: Slithering in darkness. Unsettling to say the least. You must be boiling to avenge your father though.
16903,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Absolutely. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: You seem pretty calm for what it is we're staring at. Where's your fire, huh?
Choice 2: I don't feel that way, exactly…
Yuri: I've gotta say, I wish you were a little more fiery about all this. Though, I suppose a lot of time has passed since your father died."
16904,"Choice 1: Absolutely. (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: You seem pretty calm for what it is we're staring at. Where's your fire, huh?"
16905,"Yuri: You seem pretty calm for what it is we're staring at. Where's your fire, huh?"

16907,"Yuri: I've gotta say, I wish you were a little more fiery about all this. Though, I suppose a lot of time has passed since your father died."
16908,Yuri: I imagine this battle will be a defining moment in history. All or nothing. Let's do this.
16909,"Balthus: I thought defeating the Empire would be the end of it, but now we're after some mysterious shadow organization? For crying out loud.… If only Holst had come along for the ride. But he's working out things with Almyra or something, yeah? Even so, maybe we better warn him about those-who-whatever-in-the-dark. They might be whatevering in his neck of the woods too. Me aside, no one's on the same level as Holst. If the Alliance is attacked while he's gone, they'll be in trouble."
16910,Constance: Whatever threatens Fódlan also threatens my dream. This folly must end now!
16911,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Aren't you scared? (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: Fear is not a consideration of mine. I do what must be done and always have.
Choice 2: Do you think we have a chance?
Constance: You go to war harboring such doubts? Pray keep these fainthearted ruminations to yourself!"
16912,"Choice 1: Aren't you scared? (Relationship with Constance up)
Constance: Fear is not a consideration of mine. I do what must be done and always have."
16913,Constance: Fear is not a consideration of mine. I do what must be done and always have.
16914,"Choice 2: Do you think we have a chance?
Constance: You go to war harboring such doubts? Pray keep these fainthearted ruminations to yourself!"
16915,Constance: You go to war harboring such doubts? Pray keep these fainthearted ruminations to yourself!
16916,"Constance: What is frightening is to have scant idea of what is in store. Now that we know, victory shall be ours."
16917,"Hapi: Sounds like there were shenanigans happening behind the scenes in the Empire. I think war was basically inevitable no matter what Eddy did, with those creeps pulling the strings. Come to think of it, I wonder if the lady who kidnapped me was... Never mind. Not worth mentioning."
16918,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. I hear we conquered the Imperial capital...but the war's still not over? Not sure how much sense that makes, but then, making sense of things isn't my job. Look out for yourself in the next battle. Got it? I'll have lots more things to report by then. That's a promise. In the meantime, I'll be cheering you on."
16919,"Thief: I've got a message for ya...from a dead man. The emperor was keeping the archbishop alive as insurance against those who slither in the dark. ""When you go to Shambhala,"" the message says, ""take the archbishop with you."""
16920,"Rogue: Nothing tastes better than a drink to celebrate the fall of the Empire! You know... Fraldarius, one of the 10 Elites, is a distant ancestor of mine. Even if the Kingdom as we know it no longer exists, there's a poetic justice in taking the Empire down."
16921,Lysithea: Incredible… Who knew that there was such a vast space beneath the ground…
16922,Judith: It's like an underground city. I've never seen buildings like these before.
16923,Lysithea: It's like an ancient ruin… But not just because of its appearance.
16924,Ignatz: I don't recall ever seeing architecture like this.
16925,"Lorenz: It is magnificent in a sense, but I could hardly call it beautiful, Even the air feels stagnant."
16926,"Claude: In any case, it seems like we need to go further. Let's look around and see if we can find some stairs."
16927,Rhea: …
16928,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Something on your mind?
Choice 2: Are you not feeling well?"
16929,Choice 1: Something on your mind?
16930,Choice 2: Are you not feeling well?
16931,"Rhea: No. It is simply… We must defeat those who slither in the dark, no matter what happens. But if my conjecture is correct, the one who they will wish to kill the most…"
16932,"Rhea: Is you, dear child."
16933,Byleth: Why me?
16934,Rhea: They are aware that you can use the Sword of the Creator. Your body houses the same power they once bestowed upon Nemesis. That is why…I fear for you.
16935,Byleth: That's not much to go on.
16936,Rhea: Perhaps. Please forgive my errant thoughts. Once this battle is over… I will explain everything. I will tell you all I know about who you really are.

16942,"Thales: For thousands of years, we have existed underground, living on only that we might someday see our vengeance realized. Here and now, that vengeance is finally within our grasp. There is but one thing left to do. Destroy them! Damn those who stand with that arrogant goddess to oblivion, away from the world of the living!"
16943,Thales: Now is the time. Remove the binding spell of Titanus. Let their metal bodies be drenched in blood!
16944,"Claude: Hey, what are those big…things?"
16945,"Rhea: Demonic Beasts… No, I think not. They appear to have no will of their own. Someone must be controlling them."
16946,Thales: Initiate all that remain! We must advance our preparations!
16947,"Thales: Viskam has been activated? Increase output gradually, depending on the amount of magical energy charged. I don't care if we destroy Shambhala, as long as our goals are fulfilled!"
16948,Rhea: Those awful weapons have been stopped. They were being controlled from that facility!
16949,"Claude: Aw, those big things have gone to sleep on us. That will make moving around a lot easier. A dead end? Or perhaps... No, if we worry about every little detail, we won't get anywhere."
16950,Thales: You!
16951,Rhea: That is the leader of those who slither in the dark. We must go after him with all our might!
16952,Claude: It seems someone is trying to remove something. We’d better capture them first!
16953,Thales: Ha. It is laughable that base animals such as you would bare fangs at the likes of us.
16954,"Claude: I may be a base animal, but I have strong allies. Do you think you can beat Teach and the Sword of the Creator?"
16955,Thales: The Sword of the Creator… The blade given to Nemesis. Who do you really think is superior?
16956,Claude: There’s a big difference between the living and the dead. The fate of the future lies in the hands of the living!
16957,Thales: You will never get to enjoy your victory.
16958,Rhea: It can't be...
16959,Thales: For all Agarthans... Let there be light!
16960,Soldier: It's coming down!

16967,Marianne: Goddess… Please save Lady Rhea…
16968,Hilda: All we can do now is pray…
16969,"Claude: Remember when this place was taken five years ago, and a pure White Beast appeared on the battlefield? I only caught a glimpse of it, but I didn't understand where it came from. There were rumors that the goddess sent it to protect the monastery… But now I know better. That beast was Rhea."
16970,Byleth: She tried to save me…
16971,Claude: Did you know Rhea's true identity?
16972,"Byleth: Looking back on it now, I suppose I did."
16973,"Claude: I once showed you a picture of a creature known as the Immaculate One. Seteth confiscated it, saying it must have been one of Tomas' personal possessions. The beast that appeared back then looked just like it. So Rhea is the Immaculate One. The book said it was a servant of the goddess, but wouldn't it make sense if beasts like that are actually children of the goddess?"
16974,Byleth: …
16975,"Claude: Rhea is in a grim state right now. It's possible she may not make it. But we have things we must ask her about. Once things calm down a little, let's go and see Rhea. Together. The truth can't be delayed any longer."

"
16989,"A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. The ambitions of the Fell King Nemesis were crushed, averting what could have been the greatest crisis in the history of Fódlan. After 5 and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. Country, faith, history...All that had once formed the order of the world was wiped clean. The heroes whose very hands saved Fódlan from a dark fate commenced with the building of a new society. The leaders of this new unified Fódlan began their walk down a seemly endless path-one toward a world that would cherish differences in race and belief, one where all life would be valued equally. Those clung to the hope that their path would not end with Fódlan—that it would someday span the seas to Dagda and beyond the Throat to Almyra...
"
16990,Rhea: I am happy to see you two…
16991,Claude: Sorry to interrupt your rest. But there are some things that we absolutely must ask you.
16992,Rhea: It seems I do not have much time left. I do not intend to hide anything any longer.
16993,Byleth: …
16994,"Claude: Rhea… I have to ask. You're the Immaculate One, aren't you? If what I'm thinking is correct, that's what the children of the goddess is referring to. In other words, you—"
16995,"Rhea: I am the last child of the progenitor god. A long time ago, the progenitor god came from somewhere far away and descended upon this continent. She changed her form to resemble that of a human, and gave her own blood to birth her children. The progenitor god and her children shared knowledge and skills with the people of the land. Together, they built a prosperous civilization. But the humans turned their backs on the teachings of the progenitor god and engaged in senseless wars. Eventually people began to think of themselves as gods and challenged the progenitor god herself to battle. The land was scorched in the war that ensured and the majority of humans were annihilated. I believe that those who slither in the dark are the descendants of those who retreated beneath the ground during that time."
16996,Claude: So they had been waiting all that time for their chance at revenge…
16997,"Rhea: It took the progenitor god an astonishing amount of time to revive the ravaged world. But eventually, the continent found peace again, and the progenitor god, having fulfilled her duty, fell into a long slumber in the Holy Tomb. The children who stayed behind built a settlement in Zanado to protect the Holy Tomb as they quietly lived out their lives. But then…Nemesis appeared, bringing tragedy along with him. Even now I cannot forget the sight…of that massive canyon, painted red with blood… I was never able to forgive those who proudly wielded weapons crafted from the corpses of my brethren. I was the only survivor of Zanado, and all I could do was wander across Fódlan clinging to my desperate desire for revenge. I called myself Seiros, fostered the founding of the Empire, and prepared to oppose Nemesis and his followers."
16998,Claude: Unbelievable…
16999,"Rhea: I put Zanado behind me to gather the remaining children who were scattered across Fódlan… Finally, we killed Nemesis on the Tailtean Plains, and I took back the Sword of the Creator."
17000,"Claude: Let me get this straight… Saint Seiros…is you?! You're kidding me, right?"
17001,Knight of Seiros: Professor. Claude. There's something you need to hear right away…
17002,"Rhea: If you have something to report, do so at once. There is no need to let my presence worry you."
17003,Knight of Seiros: As you wish… We're receiving a constant stream of express messengers from cities to the east. They claim that an unidentified military force is attacking and that there have already been a large number of casualties.
17004,Claude: What?!
17005,"Knight of Seiros: The reports indicate that the cities and towns along the East Gronder Thoroughfare in the old Hrym territory have already been destroyed. Some villages were razed completely, leaving no survivors…"
17006,Claude: Damn it! Did they come from Shambhala? Could it be that there were some remnants of that wicked group hiding there?
17007,Rhea: …
17008,"Knight of Seiros: I have a report! The unidentified military force has crossed the Great Bridge of Myrddin! Alliance forces met them in battle, but it seems they have already broken through!"
17009,Claude: They've already made it so far. Is Count Gloucester unharmed?
17010,"Hilda: The count is fine, but apparently my brother joined with reinforcements and was gravely injured…"
17011,Claude: You mean to tell me they easily got past a general as skilled as Holst?
17012,Hilda: They say the enemy general has a weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator. Even my brother was powerless to stop him…
17013,Byleth: The Sword of the Creator?
17014,Claude: That's not possible…
17015,Knight of Seiros: The enemy forces are flying a banner bearing the Crest of Flames as they continue their march west along the Airmid River.
17016,Rhea: …
17017,Knight of Seiros: We believe they're marching toward Garreg Mach. We are preparing to meet them in battle.
17018,Rhea: A weapon that resembles the Sword of the Creator… and banner bearing the Crest of Flames… There is only one explanation. The one leading the enemy force…is Nemesis himself.
17019,Claude: Nemesis? That Nemesis? Do you really think the ancient King of Liberation has been brought back to life?
17020,"Rhea: Perhaps the seal was broken when Shambhala fell… An incredible power that we children cannot hope to match dwells within the blood of the progenitor god. Nemesis obtained that blood, so it would not surprise me if that were the case."
17021,"Claude: The blood of the progenitor god… That's right, he did take the remains from the Holy Tomb, didn't he…"
17022,"Rhea: From the blood of the progenitor god, Sothis, he acquired the Crest of Flames. From her bones and heart, he crafted the Sword of the Creator."
17023,Claude: The Sword of the Creator is made from her bones and heart?
17024,Rhea: The heart of Sothis is the Crest Stone that was placed in the Sword of the Creator. The same is true of the Crests of the 10 Elites and the other Crest Stones… They were born of the blood and hearts of the progenitor god's children. Those who slither in the dark created them. Stole them. Sothis never gifted that power to the humans.
17025,"Claude: The Crests of the 10 Elites, the Crest Stones, and the Heroes' Relics… I can't believe those who slither in the dark made them all. And after that, Nemesis used the Sword of the Creator to massacre all of the progenitor god's children in Zanado… In other words, the citizens of Zanado were killed by weapons made from the remains of their brethren… How atrocious. But I don't get it… The Sword of the Creator that Teach wields doesn't have a Crest Stone. So how is Teach able to wield its full power?"
17026,Rhea: The Crest Stone of the progenitor god…dwells within your professor.
17027,Claude: … (Shocked expression)
17028,"Rhea: After I battled with Nemesis as Saint Seiros, I reclaimed the heart of Sothis. I wanted to use that heart to…resurrect her. Even though I had to do some…questionable things to achieve that goal, I wished to see Sothis…my mother…once more."
17029,Byleth: You placed her heart in me?
17030,"Rhea: Yes. I believed that if I could resurrect my mother, I could regain all that had been lost…"
17031,Claude: So…that's the truth of it.
17032,"Rhea: I suspected that your body housed the consciousness of Sothis. Those suspicions were correct. And yet, she merely gave you her power and vanished… My dearest wish did not come true… But you did inherit the power of the progenitor god. Now, you must use that power to defeat Nemesis once and for all. Fódlan's blood-stained history…must end."
17033,"Claude: Huh… What a magnificent tale! It's enough to make your head spin. Rhea's real identity is Saint Seiros, and the one who attacked us was Nemesis, the King of Liberation! On top of that, you've got the heart of the goddess in you! My flabber is completely gasted right now. But now isn't the time for standing around in disbelief. Nemesis has made it this far for a reason. If we aren't victorious, that's it for Fódlan's new dawn. The world will forever be shrouded in darkness… This is the final, FINAL battle. Finally. My friend… Please give it your all out there!"
17034,"Lorenz: A sudden invasion from Nemesis has plunged the Alliance territories into complete disarray. Against such overwhelming strength, my father and his forces had no choice but to retreat."
17035,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Wise decision. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
Choice 2: I'm glad he's survived."
17036,Choice 1: Wise decision. (Relationship with Lorenz up)
17037,Choice 2: I'm glad he's survived.
17038,"Lorenz: It was certainly prudent for him to avoid a fruitless death. But as things stand, he will not leave much of an impression on history. So that falls to me. I will do all that I can—for the future of Fódlan, and the glory of House Gloucester!"
17039,"Raphael: Hey, Professor! Have you heard from Claude? He says he's gonna throw a feast if we win the next battle! Enough food to clean out the stores!"
17040,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That sounds great! (Relationship with Raphael up)
Choice 2: So what?"
17041,Choice 1: That sounds great! (Relationship with Raphael up)
17042,Choice 2: So what?
17043,"Raphael: So I'm super motivated to win! I'm gonna train every muscle I got! I'm coming for you, Nemesis! I'm coming for you, feast!"
17044,Ignatz: I got the gist of it from Claude. Those who slither in the dark… They seem to be descended from humans who were forced deep underground after the goddess defeated them.
17045,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That's what I heard. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
Choice 2: Is that right?"
17046,Choice 1: That's what I heard. (Relationship with Ignatz up)
17047,Choice 2: Is that right?
17048,"Ignatz: They were trying to wipe out the goddess and her followers in hopes of taking back the surface. That's why they called themselves saviors. To their mind, they were."
17049,"Lysithea: It seems there are some Shambhala loyalists in Nemesis's forces. As long as they're around, we can expect them to continue with their cruel experiments."
17050,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We must win.
Choice 2: Let's wipe them out, then. (Relationship with Lysithea up)"
17051,Choice 1: We must win.
17052,"Choice 2: Let's wipe them out, then. (Relationship with Lysithea up)"
17053,Lysithea: Yes. We have to. It's the only way to ensure nobody else will go through what I went through. We must obliterate them in the next battle. It's the only recompense for Edelgard's death.
17054,"Marianne: Just when we thought we'd made it to the end, another enemy approaches… Can we be sure this battle is the last one?"
17055,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't know.
Marianne: Of course, there's no way to really know what will happen.
Choice 2: This is it, I think. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: I think you're right."
17056,"Choice 1: I don't know.
Marianne: Of course, there's no way to really know what will happen."
17057,"Marianne: Of course, there's no way to really know what will happen."
17058,"Choice 2: This is it, I think. (Relationship with Marianne up)
Marianne: I think you're right."
17059,Marianne: I think you're right.
17060,"Marianne: Just a little further to the end. Come on, Professor. We have to win!"
17061,Hilda: My big brother challenged Nemesis. He knew he couldn't win. He just did it so that his friends could escape. He emerged from the battle with a terrible injury. It's a miracle he didn't die.
17062,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I'm glad he made it. (Relationship with .*Hilda up)
Hilda: Yeah. Me too.
Choice 2: That was so noble of him.
Hilda: Well, maybe he should have been a little less noble. When you're dead, you're dead."
17063,"Choice 1: I'm glad he made it. (Relationship with .*Hilda up)
Hilda: Yeah. Me too."
17064,Hilda: Yeah. Me too.
17065,"Choice 2: That was so noble of him.
Hilda: Well, maybe he should have been a little less noble. When you're dead, you're dead."
17066,"Hilda: Well, maybe he should have been a little less noble. When you're dead, you're dead."
17067,"Hilda: Dying to save someone else…seems to defeat the purpose. I wouldn't do it. He's alive, and in spite of myself, I'm really proud of him."
17068,"Leonie: So, we're defending Fódlan's future, huh? Kind of makes my mercenary ambitions feel pretty small. So I'll think about my promise to Captain Jeralt to protect you instead. That'll be my reason to fight."
17069,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Thank you. (Relationship with Leonie up)
Choice 2: That works."
17070,Choice 1: Thank you. (Relationship with Leonie up)
17071,Choice 2: That works.
17072,"Leonie: If I can get you through this in one piece, that's just as good as defending Fódlan's future, isn't it? I just hope he's watching."
17073,"Ferdinand: The javelins of light that destroyed Fort Merceus… They are what destroyed Shambhala. They were trying to shroud the city in darkness. Perhaps they were planning to swallow us up in that same darkness. Maybe the javelins of light were a signal to Nemesis. To awaken him from his long slumber. What do you think, Professor?"
17074,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I think you're exactly right. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: Yes, indeed. I have done some good pondering here.
Choice 2: I think you're way off the mark.
Ferdinand: Oh! Really? Hm. Maybe I got a couple of things wrong, but I thought I was pretty close…"
17075,"Choice 1: I think you're exactly right. (Relationship with Ferdinand up)
Ferdinand: Yes, indeed. I have done some good pondering here."
17076,"Ferdinand: Yes, indeed. I have done some good pondering here."

Ferdinand: Oh! Really? Hm. Maybe I got a couple of things wrong, but I thought I was pretty close…"
17078,"Ferdinand: Oh! Really? Hm. Maybe I got a couple of things wrong, but I thought I was pretty close…"
17079,"Ferdinand: If we keep up this momentum, we will be able to take down Nemesis and restore peace in Fódlan."
17080,"Linhardt: When you think of it, as one approaches the end of a war, the sacrifices only grow larger, don't they? The winning side musters their forces and attempts to strike a decisive blow... While those of the losing side make desperate attempts to turn the war in their favor. Neither side will give. I only wish we'd consider those who lose their lives in that struggle."
17081,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're far from being safe ourselves. (Relationship with Linhardt up)
Linhardt: Yes, exactly my point. Let's be careful to ensure we don't lose our lives, Professor.
Choice 2: It's a necessary sacrifice.
Linhardt: Perhaps, but that doesn't make it any easier to accept your own survival depends on a throw of the dice.
Choice 3: It's better than dragging the war out.
Linhardt: I can appreciate that, but just because a choice is better does not mean that it's good."

17094,"Caspar: There's not a lot of time, but I'm afraid we won't win if we don't train!"
17095,"Bernadetta: The King of Liberation? The Fell King? His name is Nemesis, right? And he was hidden away for over a thousand years. Wow, that's a really long time all to himself… But that doesn't make him worth admiring, no matter how much I envy him!"
17096,"Byleth:

Choice 1: Let's end it with the next battle.

17106,"Petra: I can feel a weight in the air. It is different from before. I do not know this Nemesis person, except what I have been reading. But I am not of Fódlan. My knowledge of this person is very little. Even so, I feel that...I can understand it. I know that our enemy has great strength. I am...feeling great fear for this battle."

17152,"Seteth: Before the monastery was completed, there was a massive battle on the Tailtean Plains. In that battle, the warrior Seiros defeated the Fell King Nemesis and reclaimed the bones and heart of Sothis. Those make up the divine sword that you wield, and the Crest that you bear. Now, Rhea…Seiros…lies helpless. The only one who can defeat this so-called King of Liberation is the inheritor of divine power. You have our full and unwavering support. Only you can do this. Please, save this world."

17154,"Hanneman: Shambhala… An underground city with an entirely different lineage than the goddess? Shame phenomena, driven by a source totally alien to the Crests that we understand. Most unsettling! Could it be magic? Some manner of technology? I would like to know the truth of it all. Very much so. I want to know their history, their knowledge. Why do you suppose they chose this place to occupy?"
17155,"Byleth: Well, I don't know."

17167,"Alois: We thought we'd taken down the mastermind of this war, and then the Fell King Nemesis shows up! Well, no matter what evil creatures we have to face, this old soul will keep defending Garreg Mach. Not only Garreg Mach. Also Lady Rhea. Also you. I think Jeralt would be saying the same kind of thing if he were here right now."
17168,"Catherine: I try not to think about what would happen if Lady Rhea were harmed. I can't bear the thought of it. I'm not sure why the Fell King Nemesis picked right now to come back to life. But it makes me angry, that's for sure! Let's kick him back down into the dirt, where he belongs."

17178,"Judith: Did you hear? Our enemy is Nemesis. Unbelievable. It sounds so crazy, but there's no laughing it off. We must make our move before they reach the monastery."
17179,"Gatekeeper: Professor! I just have to say thanks! For everything! I'm on high alert today, so don't you worry about a thing. This mysterious military force approaching Garreg Mach… Is it true that Nemesis is with them?! It was Nemesis who led the 10 Elites against Saint Seiros. It's the stuff of legend. But this time, he won't have the 10 Elites on his side. Right? He won't, right?!"
17180,"Alliance Knight: Fódlan is essentially no more… We have nothing standing between us and Nemesis. If we're defeated, the whole land will be in great danger. We have no choice but to stake our lives on stopping the enemy."
17181,"Churchgoer: Lady Rhea was injured? How could such a thing happen? Wasn't she supposed to be resting? I can't believe she'd put herself in danger by going into battle in that state… Oh, Goddess… Please save Lady Rhea…"
17182,"Churchgoer: Just when I thought bringing the Empire down would end the war, you had to fight where? Against whom? Everyone's all abuzz again… Could another conflict already be looming? Will this war ever end…"
17183,"Knight of Seiros: I can hardly believe we're going to go up against Nemesis… Unfortunately, my doubt won't change the situation. There's nothing for it but to prepare for battle! We must protect Lady Rhea!"
17184,"Merchant: A turning point in history can also be a chance for profit… At least, that's what I thought. But it's not working out that way. And now we have Nemesis to contend with. I can't catch a break! For our sake, please be victorious. If you lose, everything we've worked so hard for will have been for nothing."
17185,"Merchant: I thought I'd be able to move a lot of merchandise with a big sale, to commemorate the beginning of the new age of peace. But until you've taken care of Nemesis, I'm just going to have to maintain my usual prices…"
17186,"Monk: Once Lady Rhea is fully recovered, she will resume her role as the archbishop of the church. Once she's in her rightful place, we'll need a sovereign to lead all of Fódlan. I think you or Claude would be ideal."
17187,"Soldier: I thought there was no reason to fight anymore… That was a bit naive, I suppose. I guess it will be a while before I can see my family again. But it's worth it for the sake of Fódlan's future!"
17188,"Soldier: I thought the fighting was over…but it seems I will have the honor of fighting beside you a while yet. I may just be a humble soldier, but I will give everything I have for the defense of Fódlan!"
17189,"Soldier: Nothing but unsettling news lately... One crisis after another. My fellow soldiers all seem strangely calm about it. Perhaps it's just because we all believe in you so much. With you around, we know everything will work out."
17190,"Yuri: Throughout my life, I'm always calculating—always trying to suss out what will happen next. But this? I never could've figured Nemesis rising from his grave and coming to kill us all. Who'd have figured, you know?"
17191,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It's quite a surprise… (Relationship with Yuri up)
Yuri: Then again, if I were able to predict everything, life would be a drag. I intend to lean into the chaos, heh heh.
Choice 2: I figured that.
Yuri: Cute. But not that cute right now. Anyway, we're backed into a corner, so may as well make the most of it, yeah?"
17192,"Choice 1: It's quite a surprise… (Relationship with Yuri up)

17196,"Balthus: In the end, I guess it's a good thing Holst isn't joining us… If Nemesis could rough up my buddy that bad, he must be tough as hell."
17197,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Do you think we can win?
Balthus: Between the two of us, we can't lose. Not to mention our allies. We've escaped death, and we'll do it again.
Choice 2: We'll win no matter what. (Relationship with Balthus up)
Balthus: Damn straight! Between the two of us, we can't lose. Not to mention our allies. Death has nothin' on us."

17203,"Constance: I won't allow my—pardon, OUR dream to be snuffed out by one who should be long dead! The coming battle will demonstrate to all the world the power that I, Constance von Nuvelle, wield!"
17204,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You sound eager.
Constance: And why wouldn't I be? It is by these deeds that the world will know my name—er, will know peace!

17209,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. A nosy little bird told me some undead jerk is coming to attack us. That's just silly, though. Puuure silly. On a personal note... I'm, uh, chewing on an idea. Marriage. I'm thinking of getting hitched! If I do... I may have to move up top. I'd like to leave this place on my own two feet, not in a body bag. I want to live! For her. So... please win this one, Professor. Do it for all of us."
17210,"Girl: I came here with my grandpa, but then he fell down and now he's not moving anymore. Did my grandpa die? I dunno what to do."

17215,"Jeralt: Sorry… It looks like…I'm going to have to leave you now. (groans) One day, I hope you'll give this ring to someone you love as well as I love her."
17216,Byleth: (Someone I love…)
17217,"Claude: What's the plan, my friend?"
17218,Byleth: We will defeat Nemesis.
17219,"Claude: I thought you'd say that. And of course, I'll be joining you. What about the rest of you? Our enemy is a monster of legend. As always, there's not a shred of proof that we can win."
17220,"Lorenz: A foolish inquiry, Claude. I must finish what my father started…"
17221,Hilda: Started? Your father ran away before the battle even began.
17222,"Lorenz: I…well. All the more reason why I, as his heir, cannot flee now!"
17223,Hilda: I'm in. I need to get back at him for hurting my brother. I'm not going to let him get away with it!
17224,Ignatz: Wow… Hilda's serious about this!
17225,Lysithea: I too will fight until the end. I wish to protect Fódlan's future.
17226,Leonie: I feel the same as Lysithea. It would hardly be fitting for Captain Jeralt's apprentice to bow out now. I'll show them everything he taught me.
17227,"Marianne: I…I will give it my all as well! For the professor, for Claude, and for all of you who helped make me as strong as I am now!"
17228,"Raphael: I'm in too! And when we're done, I'm gonna eat tons of steak to celebrate!"
17229,"Ignatz: This truly is the final battle… At this point, you shouldn't have to ask, Claude. You know we're with you."
17230,"Claude: I do know that, Ignatz. But I had to ask just to make sure."
17231,"Judith: Heh. Look at how reliable you kids have become. You've trained them well, Professor. This Nemesis guy should be arriving soon. Is everyone ready?"
17232,Claude: It's finally time.
17233,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I won't let us lose.

17237,"Claude: I'm on board with that. Let's all make it through this alive. Let's defeat this dusty old King of Liberation and put an end to this history of lies. Once we've done that, there'll be nothing holding us back. A new and brighter age will begin. Let's go, my friend! Fódlan's new dawn awaits!"

17243,Claude: Nemesis is here…and with more soldiers than expected.
17244,"Hilda: A swamp, huh? But there’s something about it… It looks odd somehow."
17245,Agarthan Soldier: Agh! Can’t…breathe…
17246,Odesse: He should not have done that… Be careful. The water is poisonous to the living.
17247,Claude: It looks like we’d better not get near that swamp… Try to avoid it during the fight!
17248,Claude: Huh?! I think they’ve got some sort of magical link with Nemesis…
17249,Marianne: Could the magic be protecting him?
17250,"Claude: Not sure, but we’d better take out his 10 commanders before taking him on."
17251,Nemesis: Seiros! I will kill you! Do not get in my way!
17252,"Claude: So, that's Nemesis… You're a crusty old bastard, you know that?"
17253,Nemesis: All those who stand in my way…will be destroyed!
17254,"Raphael: Wah! Watch out, Claude! They're coming for us!"
17255,Claude: No effect!? So Nemesis is... invincible...
17256,"Claude: Nine more commanders remaining… We just killed number 10. These can’t be the 10 Elites, can they? Nah, not likely."
17257,Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared! (Only if Lamine is the first of the 10 Elites to be defeated.)
17258,Lorenz: Professor! Claude! All the subordinates to Nemesis have been eliminated!
17259,"Claude: It took some doing, but now’s our chance to face off against Nemesis!"
17260,Claude: Agh! Demonic Beasts flying in from the south… Someone here must be able to summon them!
17261,Lysithea: I sense an unusual presence. Someone may be hiding there.
17262,Odesse: Argh... Thales!
17263,Claude: Now he can’t call any more Demonic Beasts. Time to see off his allies.
17264,Claude: Now he can’t call any more Demonic Beasts. And the remaining forces of Shambhala have been defeated too.
17265,Claude: Hey… Can you speak?
17266,Riegan: …
17267,"Claude: Just puppets controlled by Nemesis… Well, they’re the strongest puppets I’ve ever known."
17268,Ignatz: Whoa. The swampland vanished. (If he is alive at the time of the battle.)
17269,Hilda: Look! The swampland cleared! (If Ignatz dies either before the battle or her defeat.)
17270,"Claude: That one seemed to work… We’re almost done! Let’s go, my friend."
17271,Nemesis: You are a foolish child.
17272,Claude: Tough talk from a guy who's lived too long. Allow me to fix that!
17273,Nemesis: You are all pathetic weaklings! You lack the courage to challenge me in lone combat.
17274,"Claude: Yet we have the strength to scale the walls between us, to reach our hands in friendship, so we can open our true hearts to one another! (Claude fires an arrow into the air)"
17275,Claude: That's how we win!
17276,"Claude: Future historians will refer to this day as the new dawn of Fódlan. Of that, I have no doubt."
17277,Claude: It's up to you now Teach. As for my path...
17278,"In the Imperial year 185, the construction of Garreg Mach was completed. Saint Seiros held a sacred ritual to honor the occasion. Four saints, known as the Four Apostles, we led to a tranquil place to perform the ritual. They poured their holy essences into the Chalice of Beginnings - a gift from the goddess herself - in hopes of bringing about her second coming. Alas, the Rite of Rising failed…
"
17279,"Bearing the blame for the ritual’s failure, the Four Apostles left the monastery, all but vanishing from the land. The first sought the lush forest of Adrestia’s mountains. The second traversed Fódlan’s Fangs, settling on the ocean’s salted shores. The third traveled to the mountains, vanishing beneath their lofty peaks. And the fourth faded into shadow in a town untouched by day’s light. Lost to history, nothing but legend now remains of the Four Apostles, their offering to the Nabatean chalice, and the goddess who never returned.

17284,Alois: Excuse me! Sorry to intrude!
17285,"Alois: Please, forgive the disruption, Lady Rhea, but I have that report you asked for."
17286,"Rhea: Do not worry yourself, Alois. As it happens, I am presently unoccupied. Please, go on."
17287,"Alois: Ah, great! I’ll just… Huh? What’s that book you’ve got there?"
17288,Rhea: It is a chronicle covering the 995 years since Garreg Mach Monastery’s completion.
17289,Alois: Huh! Sounds like a good read!
17290,"Rhea: Maintaining the church’s records is one of the duties entrusted to all archbishops, myself included. This one states that Saint Seiros ordered the monastery’s construction after the end of the War of Heroes. This is a rare and valuable text. Most documents of that era have been lost to time."
17291,"Alois: I see, I see… Time aside, we also lost many books in that massive fire 21 years ago…"
17292,Rhea: Indeed. What was once well documented exists now only in this chronicle. Not least of which is the ceremony commemorating the monastery’s completion.
17293,"Alois: Interesting! I’ll admit, I know the year it took place but not a thing beyond that."
17294,"Rhea: That is to be expected, unfortunately. According to this chronicle, the Rite of Rising was held during the ceremony. The intent was to bring about the goddess’s rebirth."
17295,"Alois: The Rite of Rising, eh? Hm, can’t say I’ve ever heard of that one."
17296,"Rhea: I am not surprised. There should be countless records documenting that important ritual. Alas… Today, all we have to go on are fragments of forgotten memories and our own imaginations. One thing is clear… Their wish for the goddess’s return was most fervent. Saint Seiros held the ritual along with the Four Apostles: Noa, Chevalier, Timotheos, and Aubin. However, it did not bear fruit, as the goddess did not return to this world… So it is written."
17297,"Alois: I’ve never heard of the Four Apostles before. They’re different from the Four Saints, right?"
17298,"Rhea: That is correct. Today, almost no records exist of the Four Apostles. Their names live on only in the names of their Crests, but the bloodlines bearing those tokens of the past have been lost. Any deeper knowledge of the apostles has all but disappeared from the grand stage of history."
17299,"Alois: Well, that’s interesting. Does that mean they’re somewhere...backstage?"
17300,"Rhea: In a sense. It is possible that their bloodlines have carried on in secret, perhaps materializing where no one thought to look. I did not intend to indulge in such a long-winded lecture. Please, tell me your report, Alois. It concerns the underground, does it not?"
17301,"Alois: Oh, right! It’s as you suspected. Recently, there have been several incidents in the area beneath Garreg Mach…"
17302,Dimitri: Claude… Are you certain that suspicious individual you spotted went through...there?
17303,"Dimitri: I will say, that does look a bit like a passageway, doesn’t it?"
17304,"Claude: Unless I dreamt it up while sleepwalking, there’s no mistaking what I saw."
17305,"Edelgard: I never thought I’d say this...but I believe Claude’s story. In fact, it reminds me of something. I have heard tales of countless passages snaking beneath Garreg Mach. This is undoubtedly one of them."
17306,"Dimitri: Perhaps so. In any case, there is no telling where it leads."
17307,"Claude: Oh no. Oh, you’re right! There’s no telling what we could find. Terrible danger. Wicked creatures. Unspeakable smells! The risk is too high, Your Highnesses! I must humbly insist that you wait here, where it’s safe… and smells nice. Meanwhile, Teach and I will track down the bandit-shaped person. If we don’t return, do me a favor and call for the knights, will ya?"
17308,"Edelgard: That is quite enough. As though we would allow you to make that call on your own. With so little information, it’s far too dangerous. We’ll come along as well. Right, Dimitri?"
17309,"Dimitri: Yes, of course. If it was indeed a thief, we must not allow them to get away with their crime. Considering what took place at the Goddess’s Rite of Rebirth, vigilance is paramount."
17310,"Claude: Right, well, tag along if you insist. Just don’t come crying to me if we all meet a terrible fate, deal?"
17311,"Edelgard: Likewise. Well, no use dallying. Let’s be on our way. Unless there’s someone else we should call for?"
17312,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The four of us should suffice.
Claude: Teach is right. There isn’t a moment to lose.
Choice 2: We should bring more allies, just to be safe.
Dimitri: Yes, a fine idea. Though at this time, I fear few of our classmates are still awake.
Choice 3: Perhaps we should alert the knights.
Edelgard: Hmm… I fear our thief will have long escaped in the time it would take to summon the knights.
Dimitri: True, and most of them are currently away, investigating the Western Church."
17313,"Choice 1: The four of us should suffice.

17320,"Hilda: Whoa there! What’s all this, Professor? You and the three house leaders creeping around at night? Pretty shady, if you ask me."
17321,Ashe: It’s certainly a rare and unexpected sighting… especially considering the hour.
17322,Linhardt: Looks like a whole lot of something is about to happen. I’m going back to bed.
17323,"Edelgard: Stop right there, Linhardt. Your bad luck is our good fortune - you’re coming with us."
17324,"Claude: You can stop thinking of ways out of this, Hilda. We could use your help too."
17325,"Dimitri: You as well, Ashe. I’ll explain everything on the way."
17326,"Ashe: Happy to help! We don’t have anything better to do at this hour, so we may as well pitch in."
17327,"Dimitri: You have our gratitude. Now then, let us be on our way. Ready, Professor?"
17328,"Claude: The more the merrier, I suppose. Let’s just hope we’re not all marching to our doom…"
17329,"???: Ugh… Yuri, this is brutal. Tell me again why you’re subjecting me to this devastating boredom…"
17330,"???: Enough with the yawning, Balthus. If you’re really that bored, we could always make a friendly wager…"
17331,"???: Thanks but no thanks, pal. I’m low on funds as it is. Last thing I need is another debt I can’t pay."
17332,"???: Right, B. As if you could say no to that."
17333,???: Ahaha! How diverting that you should bicker for my amusement! Imagine my overwhelming dread were I stuck here without such joyous entertainment.
17334,???: Count me out. I’ll leave the talking to Yuri-bird and Coco.
17335,"Rogue: Hey, Boss!"
17336,"Yuri: Back already, huh? Have you detected any movement on the surface?"
17337,"Rogue: Well, uh, I looked for the cardinals’ meeting--just like you said… Thing is, I was spotted by some weirdos. They chased after me and everything."
17338,"Yuri: “Some weirdos,” you say. So very helpful. They weren’t knights, were they?"
17339,"Rogue: I dunno. There were only a few of ‘em, but I bet they were armed to the teeth!"
17340,"Yuri: With meager numbers like that, I doubt they intend to take on Abyss."
17341,"Balthus: They probably took you for some kind of villain. They’ll lock ya up if they catch ya. Finally, a little action! Let’s find them first and throw some punches."
17342,"Constance: Hold, Balthus! ‘Tis ignorance itself to rush headfirst into trouble."
17343,Hapi: You’re excited to fight too. You’ve been waiting for a chance to try out your shiny new magic.
17344,"Yuri: Heh heh, surface laws don’t apply down here. That gives us the freedom to have some fun with them. They’re probably not knights, but our new friends definitely work for the church."
17345,Constance: You had best not leave me behind!
17346,Edelgard: Hmm… It seems this place is more than a simple passageway. There’s clear evidence of human habitation.
17347,Hilda: People living under Garreg Mach… Oh! My brother used to tell me stories like that back in his Academy days.
17348,"Claude: Ah, so Holst attended the academy as well, then?"
17349,"Hilda: Of course. Back then, there were tons of rumors about what goes on below Garreg Mach. Something about tons of passages and houses beneath the town, all inhabited by super-shady people. It had a real intimidating name too. Ah, what was it again… I think it was called...Abyss?!"
17350,"Balthus: That’s two points for the pink-haired gal! Welcome to Abyss, strangers."
17351,Dimitri: Identify yourself! That uniform…
17352,"Balthus: Welcome, curious students of the Officers Academy! What brings such fine, upstanding surface dwellers to our humble abode?"
17353,Claude: We’re tracking someone who was creeping around the monastery.
17354,Edelgard: Our business here does not concern you. Do you intend to let us pass?
17355,Constance: Ahaha! Such indulgence simply cannot be permitted.
17356,"Constance: Your words may fool the fool, but I cannot be so easily deceived! I, Constance von Nuvelle, shall divine your true intentions. You are here by order of the church...which cruelly plots to eliminate the inhabitants of Abyss!"
17357,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You think the church wants to eliminate you?
Choice 2: You think we’re trying to harm you?"
17358,Choice 1: You think the church wants to eliminate you?
17359,Choice 2: You think we’re trying to harm you?
17360,Edelgard: Did she say...Nuvelle?
17361,"Balthus: I don’t care what the reason for this brawl is. A fight’s on the menu, and I’m ready to feast. Let’s get right to it, yeah?"
17362,"Dimitri: By the look of them, I'd wager they’re experienced combatants. I’m not certain this is a wise endeavor."
17363,"Claude: I was thinking the very same thing. Time to make a strategic retreat, then?"
17364,"Yuri: Turning back already? Oh, but you’ll make me so sad. Now why would you wanna do that?"
17365,Yuri: Everyone here is starved for amusement. They’ve been waiting for a good fight.
17366,"Claude: Wow, look at that. A flawless example of a surprise attack. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill thugs."
17367,"Dimitri: Claude, this isn’t the time to be impressed by our enemy. We must find a way through at once."
17368,"Balthus: Wait… Claude, is it? As in the brand-new heir of House Riegan?"
17369,"Claude: Who, me? Nah. Wrong guy. Claude’s a common name in Fódlan. It’s just too dashing for new moms to pass up. It’s even a popular choice for fake names. Just a good, solid, all-purpose moniker, you know?"
17370,"Balthus: Right, except there’s only one Claude enrolled at the academy this year. Looks like that’s you."
17371,Claude: How do you even know that?
17372,"Balthus: Ha, you just gave yourself away, pal. Looks like my luck’s finally taking a turn for the good. All right, so your choices are as follows: line up for the beating of a lifetime...or let us lock you up like the good little boys and girls you undoubtedly are."
17373,"Claude: I have no clue what this guy’s going on about, but it looks like a fight’s in order, and it’s pretty much all my fault. There’s a saying from the east about fighting a flicker with a flame. Seems applicable right about now."
17374,Balthus: Finally! Let’s do this already! Prepare to face the Almighty King of Grappling!
17375,Hilda: Hm… Why can’t I shake the feeling that I know that wild man?
17376,"Dimitri: Who are you people, anyhow? It doesn’t seem right to cross blades without knowing at least that much."
17377,"Hapi: Wow, does it hurt to take yourself that seriously? Answer the man’s question, B."
17378,"Balthus: Why me? Eh, fine. We’re the Ashen Wolves. We’re the secret fourth house in Abyss. The surface world turned its back on us, and we did the same in return. Back for a back, as they say."
17379,"Edelgard: A fourth house? Impossible. Still, we must focus on the battle ahead…"
17380,"Linhardt: Seems like it’ll be tough to fight here. It’s kind of dark. Looks like a great place to nap, though…"
17381,Ashe: The locks on those gates look really complicated… There must be another way through.
17382,Claude: Nothing’s happening… What are we doing wrong?
17383,"Yuri: I think the better question is, what aren’t you doing wrong? Only we can operate that."
17384,Claude: You look...familiar. Have we met?
17385,Balthus: Not a chance. You’d remember meeting a specimen like me.
17386,Claude: True. I’d definitely remember this sharp twinge of annoyance.
17387,Balthus: Stop yappin’ and start slappin’!
17388,"Hilda: I can't shake the feeling that I know you from somewhere, but... I'm drawing a blank. Either way, you wouldn't want to hurt a helpless girl like me. Maybe you should let us off the hook."
17389,Balthus: Anything for a pretty lady. Why don't we talk it out over a hot meal? Your treat? Actually... Scratch that. Something tells me I'd best stay away from this one.
17390,"Balthus: Come and get some, kiddo! I won’t hold back, so you better not either! These fists are packed with years of pent-up resentment. Time to let loose!"
17391,"Balthus: Urgh… You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that much."
17392,"Hapi: Come to think of it, there’s an easier way to handle this. *sigh*"
17393,Linhardt: What was that?! It couldn’t have been a summoning spell…
17394,Constance: Ahahaha! It would behoove you to watch your back!
17395,Ashe: Oh no! I knew something didn’t feel right!
17396,"Hapi: Is it too late for me to back out of this fight? I don’t want to hurt anyone. But in this case, I guess there’s no avoiding it."
17397,Hapi: This is...boring. Count me out.
17398,"Constance: You're of noble stock, yes? Name yourself!"
17399,Edelgard: Certainly. I am Edelgard.
17400,"Constance: That is the same name as the Imperial princess! It's a lovely name, but a bit cheeky in my view."
17401,Edelgard: Ugh.
17402,Constance: Underestimate the denizens of Abyss and it won’t end well for you! Tremble in fear at my magical might! Ahaha!
17403,Constance: It’s not that I’m defeated so much as I’m temporarily grounded.
17404,Yuri: I know you… You’re the one Lord Lonato adopted. Isn’t that right?
17405,"Ashe: That’s right. Wait… I recognize you too! You’re Count Rowe’s adopted son! I don’t know how you ended up here, but your house is no doubt worried sick! Let’s get you home, OK?"
17406,Yuri: You really think I’d choose to go back there? Haha! Better watch yourself--you might lose a limb...or your life.
17407,"Yuri: Well, what have we here? Some lost kids stumbling around in the dark. Stay awhile, won’t you? Shame indeed not to have a bit of fun with each other while we’ve got the chance, you know?"
17408,Yuri: Heh heh. Maybe I got a bit too carried away. Nah…
17409,"Claude: It’s safe to say we’ve won this round, don’t you think? Uh… “B,” was it?"
17410,"Balthus: The name’s Balthus. I don’t lose often, but I can at least recognize what it looks like."
17411,"Hilda: Balthus… Balthus… BALTHUS?! From House Albrecht?! Baltie, is that you?! Whew, haha! You look, uh...old."
17412,"Balthus: Huh? Do we know each other, pal? Wait a minute… That hair. Those eyes. That voice! Hilda?! I don’t believe it! Holst’s little sis?!"
17413,"Balthus: Heh, I don’t believe it. Little Hilda herself. Why didn’t you speak up sooner?"
17414,"Hilda: Baltie, this isn’t the time to catch up. What would Holst think?! I bet you didn’t consider that, did you?"
17415,"Balthus: Yeesh… I dunno, but it wouldn’t be nice."
17416,Hilda: …
17417,"Balthus: Look, sorry. OK? Just don’t tell Holst. If he knew I raised a hand against you, he’d have my head."
17418,"Hilda: Ha! Like he’d stop at your head. Fine though. Just this once, and just for you, I’ll keep quiet."
17419,Claude: Now that that’s sorted… What did you mean about it being lucky that you found me?
17420,"Balthus: Oh, that. One of the guys I owe gold to is Count Gloucester. He said something about forgiving my debt if I could dig up some dirt on you. Figured this was my shot."
17421,"Claude: Aha, so it was purely selfish. But then, was a fight really necessary?"
17422,Balthus: Really was. Best way to acquaint yourself with someone is to get into a tussle with ‘em. That’s common sense right there.
17423,"Byleth:
Choice 1: That makes sense.
Hapi: Huh. I had no idea there were others like B out there. (if Byleth is female) Who knew such a refined lady could be so backwards.
Choice 2: That doesn’t sound right…
Yuri: That’s the correct response for a reasonable person. We’re not all as far gone as Balthus here."
17424,"Choice 1: That makes sense.
Hapi: Huh. I had no idea there were others like B out there. (if Byleth is female) Who knew such a refined lady could be so backwards."
17425,Hapi: Huh. I had no idea there were others like B out there. (if Byleth is female) Who knew such a refined lady could be so backwards.
17426,"Choice 2: That doesn’t sound right…
Yuri: That’s the correct response for a reasonable person. We’re not all as far gone as Balthus here."
17427,Yuri: That’s the correct response for a reasonable person. We’re not all as far gone as Balthus here.
17428,"Balthus: Say what you will, but I learned all I need to know. It’s clear this lot has nothing to do with the church’s intentions. But that means those other creeps could always attack us at any moment."
17429,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What creeps?
Choice 2: Who would attack you?"
17430,Choice 1: What creeps?
17431,Choice 2: Who would attack you?
17432,Balthus: Someone’s targeting Abyss. Mercenaries keep sniffing around and causing trouble here. They won’t let up.
17433,"Yuri: It’s a real problem, and we have no clue who’s pulling the strings. There are many within the church who would love to see this “filthy” underground city purged. When you first showed up, we thought you were here to do just that. Apologies for the confusion."
17434,Hilda: So that’s why you came at us with that nasty “kill the outsiders” act.
17435,"Hapi: As Yuri-bird said, we’re sorry. We’re all pretty on edge these days."
17436,Constance: Indeed! That someone would descend to Abyss out of pure curiosity was far too outlandish to consider.
17437,Byleth: What is the purpose of Abyss?
17438,Balthus: No idea. These tunnels have been around for ages. They could be older than the monastery for all we know.
17439,"Constance: None remain who know the complete truth. However, I shall tell you all that we know for certain… Abyss is home to those who shun the light of day. It is the secret shadow of Garreg Mach, if you will."
17440,Hapi: The church quietly tolerates us. They think they need a place like this for Garreg Mach to thrive.
17441,"Yuri: The deal is simple. Abyssians never get involved with the surface, and the surface never gets involved with us."
17442,"Constance: Alas! For some foul reason, surface dwellers have been after us as of late. Further oppressing those souls who can only find solace beneath the ground? I cannot abide it! Though it pains me to admit, we, too, harbor valid reasons for not venturing into the light. That is why, by the grace of our esteemed patron, we have been granted sanctuary here in Abyss."
17443,"Hilda: I see… Baltie, does that mean you’ve got a reason for being here too?"
17444,"Balthus: Afraid so, Hilda. I’m here because...there are more bounties on my head than there is hair. Needed to lay low. Real low."
17445,Hilda: Baltie… That’s awful.
17446,Yuri: Enough with the niceties. Let’s get these surface dwellers out of here.
17447,Constance: Nonsense! Intolerable nonsense! Whyever would we let slip this chance to acquire their aid?
17448,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You need our help? (Continue below)
Choice 2: We refuse to get involved.
Balthus: Easy there, pal. Can’t say no before we’ve even asked for anything. Talk is cheap, but listining’s free, yeah?"
17449,Choice 1: You need our help? (Continue below)
17450,"Choice 2: We refuse to get involved.
Balthus: Easy there, pal. Can’t say no before we’ve even asked for anything. Talk is cheap, but listining’s free, yeah?"
17451,"Balthus: Easy there, pal. Can’t say no before we’ve even asked for anything. Talk is cheap, but listining’s free, yeah?"
17452,"Balthus: Like we said, recently this place is being targeted by mercenaries. Myself excluded, a lot of the folks who live here can’t defend themselves. They’re here to avoid conflict. The elderly, the infirm...orphans, lost souls… merchants who were chewed up and spit out by the nobility. The works."
17453,"Constance: It rests on us to protect those who cannot protect themselves...and to safeguard our home. To that noble end, I must insist that you lend us your strength!"
17454,"Dimitri: I feel for your cause, truly. However, I cannot help but wonder why you would trust us so readily. We are from the surface, after all."
17455,"Yuri: Trust is a choice. We’re choosing to trust you. For now. It’s clear you’re not here by command of the church. And you’re not just a bunch of noble twerps, either. You can hold your own. It’s in the way you fight. How you carry yourselves. Still… I’m reluctant to get you involved with this madness. It’s our problem, not yours."
17456,Hapi: It’s too late now--we already told them everything. Let’s at least give them a chance to decide for themselves.
17457,Constance: Most true. Wander about Abyss for a time and I am certain you will come to the only correct conclusion.
17458,"Balthus: Right, what she said. Take a look, think some thoughts. Consider yourselves our special guests."
17459,"I never would have imagined…
"
17460,"Might you possibly be...
"
17461,"What a unique town.
"
17462,"Who knew…
"
17463,"Have you seen the library?
"
17464,"There’s gear here we could salvage…
"
17465,"I know you, Baltie…
"
17466,"It’s Balthus…
"
17467,"I’ve heard the rumors.
"
17468,"Want my advice?
"
17469,"Don’t knock boredom...
"
17470,"Find someone else to bother.
"
17471,"I bet you’re real bad…
"
17472,"I offer my prayers to my gods.
"
17473,"New here? Watch your back.
"
17474,"Don’t let that pretty face of his fool you…

17475,"I’d love some of what the nobles drink…

"
17480,Byleth: (I should hear what the residents have to say…)
17481,"Constance: Pardon, but might you possibly be the Imperial Princess herself?"
17482,Edelgard: I am. And you are Constance of House Nuvelle. I recall hearing of your disappearance. I never would have imagined you’d end up in a place like this…
17483,Constance: Your presence is equally curious. What business could you have here? Don’t tell me it was idle curiosity.
17484,"Edelgard: As I believe you are well aware, we were chasing after a suspicious individual."
17485,"Dimitri: What do you think, Professor? This is a most… unique town, is it not? Incredible, really, that those who faced oppression on the surface are able to find sanctuary here. Oh, not to say that there’s no helping the situation in Fódlan. To do just that is our duty and our honor. Even so, I find the idea...rather lovely."
17486,"Claude: Who knew an entire town was hiding beneath the monastery? And a secret fourth house to boot. Secrets upon secrets--oh, I’m just itching to know them all! I’m sure Rhea knows all about this place. Gods, how many secrets does that lady have?"
17487,"Linhardt: Oh. Hello, Professor. Have you seen this library of theirs? It’s completely different from the one in the monastery. And their collection is amazing. There are forgeries and banned books. Legends, spells, and heresies. Doubt I’ll catch a single wink tonight."
17488,"Ashe: It looks like this is where the people of Abyss leave their unwanted belongings. I didn’t expect to find much, but there’s actually plenty of gear we could salvage. I’m told we can take anything we can use, so it might be good to check on it now and again."
17489,"Hilda: Heya, Professor! Allow me to introduce you to my brother’s best friend. You can call him Baltie."
17490,"Balthus: Actually, it’s Balthus. You’ve probably heard of me. In the Alliance, I’m known as a...how should I put it?"
17491,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A hero?
Balthus: Heh, something like that. To be precise, I’m known as the Undisputed King of Grappling!
Choice 2: An outlaw?
Hilda: Right answer! This guy's notorious for picking fights and shirking debts. He's got a whole army of bounty hunters chasing after him."
17492,"Choice 1: A hero?
Balthus: Heh, something like that. To be precise, I’m known as the Undisputed King of Grappling!"
17493,"Balthus: Heh, something like that. To be precise, I’m known as the Undisputed King of Grappling!"
17494,"Choice 2: An outlaw?
Hilda: Right answer! This guy's notorious for picking fights and shirking debts. He's got a whole army of bounty hunters chasing after him."
17495,Hilda: Right answer! This guy's notorious for picking fights and shirking debts. He's got a whole army of bounty hunters chasing after him.
17496,"Balthus: I may not look it, but I was once a noble from a minor house. Life’s full of twists and turns."
17497,"Hilda: I know you, Baltie. I’m pretty sure you got yourself into this mess."
17498,"Yuri: You’re not a holy knight, and you don’t seem all that special, but you’re certainly mysterious, wielding that Hero’s Relic. Yeah, I’ve heard all about you. But I never figured I’d see you down here, chasing after someone and getting lost in the process."
17499,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What is this place?
Yuri: The classroom for the Ashen Wolf House. Just so we’re clear, we’re not affiliated with the Officers Academy.
Choice 2: An underground house, huh?"
17500,"Choice 1: What is this place?
Yuri: The classroom for the Ashen Wolf House. Just so we’re clear, we’re not affiliated with the Officers Academy."
17501,"Yuri: The classroom for the Ashen Wolf House. Just so we’re clear, we’re not affiliated with the Officers Academy."
17502,"Choice 2: An underground house, huh?"
17503,"Yuri: Since we’re not part of the academy, it’s really just in place for us. Can’t go to the surface either. We’ve all got our reasons. We’re a unique bunch from all walks of life. Once you get to know us, I’m sure you’ll love it here."
17504,"Hapi: Hey, new person. Want my advice? Don’t wander too far off the beaten path. Abyssians like their privacy. If you go snooping around, there’s bound to be trouble. Wait, did I introduce myself? My name’s Hapi."
17505,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I’ve got something to report. It’s about you outsiders. Actually… Guess I shouldn’t bother reporting you to yourself. The Ashen Wolves may seem tough, but they’re harmless. Honestly? Things can get pretty boring down here. But here’s a little piece of wisdom from me to you-- boredom’s a luxury. Trust me. I know these things."
17506,"Elderly Man: Find someone else to bother. Whatever the heck you’re selling, I’m not buying. Not a trader, eh? Sorry. My mistake. Most folks chatting down here are just pawning off stolen goods."
17507,"Boy: You’re from the surface, aren’t you? I bet you’re real bad. My mom says surface people are the worst."
17508,"Mysterious Woman: Abyss is where I offer my prayers to my gods. It is the only place. The goddess of Fódlan is not one of my gods, but the statue here is not one of my gods either. I offer my prayers here all the same, because Abyss is where it is allowed."
17509,"Rogue: What’s all the commotion about? Hey, hang on… I’ve never seen you before. You a first timer? Word of advice. Watch your back. The only folks who hang around down here are the ones too shady to walk in the goddess’s light."
17510,"Rogue: (female Byleth) You’re quite a fetching lady/(male Byleth) You're quite a strapping fellow... but even your looks don’t compete with the likes of Yuri. Don’t let that pretty face of his fool you, though… He’s a rogue, through and through. Even so, the people of Abyss trust him. He may be a scoundrel, but he’s our scoundrel."
17511,Rogue: Want a drink? Course you don’t. It’s all terrible down here… Nobody important enough to carry the good stuff wants to come underground to sell it to us. It’s a shame. Just once I’d like to taste something worthy of a noble.
17512,"Girl: I told Yuri I wanted to be just like him when I grew up, and he said I shouldn’t ever say stuff like that. So I told Balthus I didn’t want to be like him when I grew up, and he said I’d grow up boring! What do they want me to say?!"
17513,"Rogue: We’re all done here, Boss. Oh, but more importantly, about your--"
17514,"Yuri: We’ll discuss that another time. For now, tend to your mission. Don’t worry. No one will die. We’ll get everyone out safely."
17515,Rogue: Hmm…
17516,"Yuri: Once the trap is set, shift your focus to protecting the Abyssians, just in case things go south."
17517,Byleth: What was that about?
17518,"Yuri: Oh, it’s you. I was just heading off to ambush our attackers. You’ll help with that, won’t you?"
17519,Dimitri: Oh? Does that mean your enemies are drawing near?
17520,"Yuri: Very good! Heh. The scouts I sent to the surface spotted some mercenaries. We closed off the entrance they used last, but it seems they’ve already found another."
17521,Ashe: This is bad! We’ve got to evacuate everyone from Abyss as quickly as possible!
17522,Yuri: That won’t be necessary. They’ll be back soon.
17523,Ashe: Huh? Who?
17524,"Hapi: Why do I have to go? No matter what we do, we’re all just gonna die in the end anyway."
17525,"Yuri: Sure, but if we do nothing, we’ll die a lot sooner. I assume the corridor is successfully camouflaged?"
17526,"Constance: But of course! Our decoys shall prevent those scoundrels from chancing upon our living quarters. Do note that I am the bait upon your hook. If we fail, I shall be left dangling in the wind. Aha! But it must be done, I fear! And so I will most happily accept the starring role in this--"
17527,Balthus: They’re at the entrance. They’ll be coming in from the east.
17528,Constance: …
17529,"Yuri: The east… Good. We’re well placed. Go ahead and draw them deeper into Abyss, just like we planned."
17530,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You’re drawing them in? (continue below)
Choice 2: Why are they targeting Abyss?
Yuri: I'd like to know that myself. But first things first. We've got to make it through this encounter."
17531,Choice 1: You’re drawing them in? (continue below)
17532,"Choice 2: Why are they targeting Abyss?
Yuri: I'd like to know that myself. But first things first. We've got to make it through this encounter."
17533,Yuri: I'd like to know that myself. But first things first. We've got to make it through this encounter.
17534,"Yuri: Launching small counterattacks on the surface won’t accomplish anything. It could also earn us the scorn of the church, if it gets messy...which it will. That’s why we have to lure the enemy underground before we take them out. I know the perfect spot."
17535,"Balthus: Admit it, pals. You’re knee-deep in this, just like us. There’s no turning back now, right?"
17536,"Ashe: Of course not! If there’s any way we can help your cause, we won’t turn our backs on you."
17537,Dimitri: That’s right. We will not stand idly by while danger befalls the innocent people of Abyss.
17538,"Edelgard: If we can capture the enemy, we can perhaps learn the reason behind their relentless attacks."
17539,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We’ll fight at your side.
Hapi: Excited, are you? Fine. we could use more bodies to throw at our enemies. Thanks for volunteering.
Choice 2: We have no choice…
Constance: How insensitive! Your lack of excitement stings."
17540,"Choice 1: We’ll fight at your side.
Hapi: Excited, are you? Fine. we could use more bodies to throw at our enemies. Thanks for volunteering."
17541,"Hapi: Excited, are you? Fine. we could use more bodies to throw at our enemies. Thanks for volunteering."
17542,"Choice 2: We have no choice…
Constance: How insensitive! Your lack of excitement stings."
17543,Constance: How insensitive! Your lack of excitement stings.
17544,"Balthus: So long as they’re fighting with us and not against us, I don’t care how excited they are. Let’s get to it!"
17545,"Balthus: Wow. An underground arena, huh? You sure know some great spots, Yuri."
17546,"Yuri: I heard about this place from someone back in town. It hasn’t been in use for a long time. I figured it could prove useful, so I spent some time clearing out the debris that was blocking the entrance."
17547,Dimitri: It seems to be a revitalized ruin… Perhaps it was originally a reception hall or something similar.
17548,"Edelgard: Perhaps. Honestly, all of Abyss feels like a ruin."
17549,Constance: Ahaha! This place is magnificent! It is just spacious enough to contain my glory! I shall not hold back here!
17550,Hapi: Large. Isolated. I wonder if it would be OK for me to sigh here…
17551,Byleth: Sigh?
17552,"Balthus: If Hapi sighs, monsters come running. No, I’m not kidding."
17553,Edelgard: I’m not sure what you could possibly mean by that…
17554,"Yuri: I wish, Hapi, but no. Absolutely no sighing. And, Constance, be glorious in moderation. Understood? This place is so big that if it collapses, all of Abyss will fall with it. The whole reason we’re luring our enemies here is to avoid damaging Abyss. Don’t lose sight of that."
17555,Constance: I am well aware of our aim!
17556,"Balthus: Sure, but that doesn’t mean we can trust you to show restraint."
17557,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I’m concerned.
Choice 2: Don’t get carried away."
17558,Choice 1: I’m concerned.
17559,Choice 2: Don’t get carried away.
17560,Constance: You as well?! I cannot fathom why I am being treated in such a way. It is the duty of the nobility to preserve the people’s safety. Do you truly believe I would destroy Abyss in my efforts to save it? Preposterous!
17561,"Hapi: That would cause trouble for Elfie too. If the underground collapses, he’s the one who will have to answer for it."
17562,Byleth: Who is Elfie?
17563,"Balthus: You must know Aelfric, yeah? He’s a big wig in the church, but a friend of Abyss. He’s the one who opened up this place to folks with nowhere else to turn. Folks like us. He gave us a home, a new life."
17564,"Constance: It is Aelfric himself who put forth the idea of establishing the Ashen Wolf House. Sadly, he faces opposition within the church, and so he cannot openly deploy the knights to aid us."
17565,"Yuri: That means Aelfric relies upon us to protect the people who live here. Us...and now you. I hope you’re ready, Professor. We’re counting on you."
17566,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Professor?
Constance: You are a professor at the Officers Academy, are you not? You may not be our instructor, but I cannot think of a more fitting title to call you.
Hapi: Seems like you’re with us now. We’ll owe you one."
17567,"Choice 1: Professor?
Constance: You are a professor at the Officers Academy, are you not? You may not be our instructor, but I cannot think of a more fitting title to call you.
Hapi: Seems like you’re with us now. We’ll owe you one."
17568,"Constance: You are a professor at the Officers Academy, are you not? You may not be our instructor, but I cannot think of a more fitting title to call you."
17569,Hapi: Seems like you’re with us now. We’ll owe you one.
17570,"Choice 2: We won’t let you down.
Hapi: Reliable, aren't you? We'll owe you one."
17571,"Hapi: Reliable, aren't you? We'll owe you one."
17572,Balthus: Time to knock some sense into their thick skulls. They picked the wrong strangers to mess with!
17573,Mercenary: Aah! I knew following those shady kids was a bad idea. This place is massive!
17574,"Balthus: Heh, they actually fell for it. Let’s get this done!"
17575,"Yuri: Other mercenaries are on their way. We left a nice trail of crumbs for them to follow. We’ll need to take them all out, or they’ll just keep coming. Let’s pull together."
17576,"Yuri: Be careful who you choose to follow. Ha, I suppose it’s too late for that now, isn’t it?"
17577,"Balthus: It’ll be a shame to mar this pretty arena with a bunch of fresh corpses, but here goes!"
17578,"Hapi: You’re a real pain in the neck, you know that?"
17579,Constance: You’ll not find it so easy to escape from the darkest depths of Garreg Mach!
17580,Mercenary: This...can’t be the place… Can it?
17581,Constance: More visitors already? Allow us to offer you a premature burial.
17582,Mercenary: Damn brats. Outta the way!
17583,Mercenary: How deep does this place go? I wonder if it’s around here somewhere…
17584,Hapi: We have to finish this fight before more show up. I wish they’d turn around and go home.
17585,"Mercenary: All right, where’s the treasure? I’ve had it with these Abyssians!"
17586,"Balthus: Jeez, will it ever end? I love a good brawl, but I’m sick of looking at these fools."
17587,Death Knight: I thought I smelled fresh blood. The worms will feast tonight! That sword awaited you in the Holy Mausoleum. Show me its power!
17588,Byleth: …
17589,"Death Knight: Now, unsheathe your sword. Show me all that you are!"
17590,Edelgard: I don’t care what brought you here. Withdraw. Now.
17591,Death Knight: …
17592,"Balthus: Some baggage you’ve got, pal. Just how many people have you slaughtered?"
17593,Death Knight: Countless.
17594,Death Knight: ...
17595,"Constance: Your composure with that weapon... Your posture... It cannot be. No, it is surely just my imagination."
17596,Death Knight: I have no time for this. To your grave!
17597,Death Knight: I’ve indulged too much. I take my leave. For now.
17598,Edelgard: Honestly! What a nuisance.
17599,Rogue: Boss! That’s the last of ‘em!
17600,"Yuri: Good. Finally. Thanks for all the help, everyone."
17601,"Mercenary: I ain’t going down without a fight! I’m taking you with me, punk!"
17602,Aelfric: I will not allow it.
17603,"Yuri: Aelfric, you’re here! Well, shall we capture this fool?"
17604,Constance: Aelfric! How serendipitous that you have come to our aid!
17605,Aelfric: I am relieved that I wasn’t too late. I do hope my presence proved useful.
17606,Balthus: No doubt about it. We needed the backup.
17607,"Byleth:
Choice 1: So, you’re Aelfric…
Choice 2: You’re with the church…"
17608,"Choice 1: So, you’re Aelfric…"
17609,Choice 2: You’re with the church…
17610,"Aelfric: Professor. I do believe this is the first time our paths have crossed, is it not? Of course, I have heard all about you from Her Grace, the archbishop. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Aelfric. The church has granted me custodianship of Abyss."
17611,"Byleth:
Choice 1: You look after Abyss?
Aelfric: Indeed. And despite my responsibilities, I am but a humble monk.
Choice 2: Pleased to meet you.
Aelfric: The pleasure is all mine."
17612,"Choice 1: You look after Abyss?
Aelfric: Indeed. And despite my responsibilities, I am but a humble monk."
17613,"Aelfric: Indeed. And despite my responsibilities, I am but a humble monk."
17614,"Choice 2: Pleased to meet you.
Aelfric: The pleasure is all mine."
17615,Aelfric: The pleasure is all mine.
17616,"Aelfric: I am sure you have already been told about Abyss’s unique situation. For varying reasons, all of the inhabitants here are unable to live a peaceful life on the surface. People like the Dagdans and Almyrans, who suffer undue persecution across Fódlan. The poor and the sick, who are forced into Abyss. Not to mention all the other unfortunate souls who ended up here. I believe it is my sacred duty to provide a place for those who have nowhere else to go."
17617,Claude: Right. And the poor and sick living in a sunless crypt helps them...how?
17618,"Dimitri: Enough, Claude. Please, forgive my friend, Aelfric. We would love to hear more."
17619,"Aelfric: In all honesty, I understand his concern. I dearly wish I could provide a better life for my flock. But it would appear that Her Grace and most of the church consider the existence of Abyss to be… something of a nuisance."
17620,"Byleth:
Choice 1: A nuisance?
Aelfric: I’m afraid so… Those within the church who would see Abyss purged are swiftly growing in number.
Choice 2: That can’t be true.
Aelfric: No? I've heard tell of those within the church who intend to purge Abyss."
17621,"Choice 1: A nuisance?
Aelfric: I’m afraid so… Those within the church who would see Abyss purged are swiftly growing in number."
17622,Aelfric: I’m afraid so… Those within the church who would see Abyss purged are swiftly growing in number.
17623,"Choice 2: That can’t be true.
Aelfric: No? I've heard tell of those within the church who intend to purge Abyss."
17624,Aelfric: No? I've heard tell of those within the church who intend to purge Abyss.
17625,Hapi: That’s the church for you. They make a big deal out of helping the helpless...when it suits them.
17626,"Balthus: We can’t just sit back and accept the way things are. We gotta fight the system! Sure, I’m here to hide from literally countless bounty hunters, but I’m not the only one in need. You’re in a bad way too, Hapi. We can’t just let the church walk all over us."
17627,"Constance: Too true. For the sake of all who dwell in Abyss, we must help dear Aelfric to turn the tide!"
17628,"Aelfric: I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Your fervent support is all the reward I could ask for. As for you, Professor, I must beg a favor of you."
17629,Byleth: What’s the favor?
17630,"Aelfric: The Ashen Wolves are a house in name alone. They are eager students with no teacher to guide them… If you could find it in your heart to take them under your wing, I would be most grateful. Naturally, your official duties take precedence, so you need only help out when your schedule allows."
17631,"Yuri: Wait a minute, Aelfric. Where’s this nonsense coming from?"
17632,Constance: I second that question! We have no need of a professor when we have you.
17633,"Aelfric: Dear flock, I am a mere guardian. I can protect you, but I cannot enrich your minds. Though I call this gathering an academy house, I have long lamented that it isn’t truly so. Now, I am blessed with the opportunity to correct this. The professor who stands before you has garnered a great deal of acclaim on the surface. A most trustworthy and esteemed teacher, to say the least. What’s more, I happen to be acquainted with the father of this fine individual."
17634,"Byleth:
Choice 1: How do you know my father?
Choice 2: When did you meet my father?
Aelfric: I met Jeralt back when he was a knight."
17635,Choice 1: How do you know my father?
17636,"Choice 2: When did you meet my father?
Aelfric: I met Jeralt back when he was a knight."
17637,Aelfric: I met Jeralt back when he was a knight.
17638,"Aelfric: I was born and raised in Garreg Mach, so I often had the opportunity to spend time with him. Your mother, as well… She was a cherished friend of mine. I was even present for their wedding. With parents like yours, I have no doubt that you possess the kindness and patience necessary to guide these students."
17639,Constance: But…
17640,"Yuri: It’ll be fine. It’s not like we’re strangers anymore. Say, Aelfric… Don’t you need to take care of those thieves?"
17641,"Aelfric: Ah, right you are. Please, excuse me. Oh, and one more thing, Professor… If ever you would like to hear more about your parents, I would be delighted to share my memories with you."

17667,"Aelfric: Ah, Professor. To what do I owe this pleasure?"
17668,Byleth: I want to hear more about my parents.
17669,"Aelfric: Ah, yes, of course you do. I will gladly tell you all that I know. Where to begin... If you have something particular in mind, please ask and I shall answer as best I can."
17670,Byleth: Tell me about my mother.
17671,"Aelfric: Kind. And wise. I would often see her in the library, her nose always buried in a book."
17672,Byleth: What was my father like back then?
17673,"Aelfric: Jeralt was...very much then as he is now. His knights would have done just about anything for him. Whenever he had time to spare, he would instruct the children of the monastery in combat and tactics. Just like those wide-eyed youngsters, your mother and I made a hero of him in our minds. When I learned that Jeralt and Sitri were to be married, I was quite surprised. Back then, Jeralt was something of a mentor to me. As for Sitri... She found it difficult to express her emotions. It was only when she was gazing at Jeralt that I ever saw her smile...a smile that rivaled the very sun. His tales of the outside world must have seemed like a lifeline for one as frail and guarded as she."
17674,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The outside world?
Choice 2: Frail?"
17675,Choice 1: The outside world?
17676,Choice 2: Frail?
17677,"Aelfric: Indeed. She lacked the strength to travel beyond the monastery. The only souls she ever spoke with were a select few within the monastery walls. I can picture it now, the stories he told her... His striking words and his boisterous laugh. Listening to him must have given her a great deal of hope. As for me, I could never have become like Jeralt, as much as I wished for it."
17678,Byleth: You wanted to be like him?
17679,"Aelfric: Ah, I suppose I did. He would tell stories from a century ago as though he had lived them himself. No matter how fervently one studies the stories of old, that is no easy task. Professor, you traveled with Jeralt before coming here. You must have seen a great many things, yes? Forgive me for overstepping, but do you not regret forgoing your travels to take up residence here?"
17680,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The archbishop requested my service.
Aelfric: I see. Well, so long as you are satisfied, it is not my place to question your decision.
Choice 2: I enjoy my work here.
Aelfric: Heh heh, well then! I suppose I have no choice but to assist you as best I can."
17681,"Choice 1: The archbishop requested my service.
Aelfric: I see. Well, so long as you are satisfied, it is not my place to question your decision."
17682,"Aelfric: I see. Well, so long as you are satisfied, it is not my place to question your decision."
17683,"Choice 2: I enjoy my work here.
Aelfric: Heh heh, well then! I suppose I have no choice but to assist you as best I can."
17684,"Aelfric: Heh heh, well then! I suppose I have no choice but to assist you as best I can."
17685,"Aelfric: To shape young minds must afford you a unique perspective on the world. I am certain my unsolicited advice is nothing but a nuisance, but please hear me out... It is my hope that you will live a full life-- experiencing the world, fostering strong relationships with people. Do so for dear Sitri, whose wish to experience such things shall regretfully never be granted."
17686,Byleth: That's why you asked me to teach the Ashen Wolves?
17687,"Aelfric: I cannot deny it. It is my own stubborn notion. One that Her Grace will likely not think kindly of. Beyond my personal motive, I believe that you alone can guide my flock to even greater heights. And perhaps you will learn from them as well. Ah, but I have taken enough of your precious time. Know that I am here for you, always."
17688,"Constance: Pray tell, Yuri. Did those foul bandits whom we bested at the arena confess to anything?"
17689,"Yuri: Not a word. And they wouldn't name names. I got the feeling they didn't know much themselves. However, one thing is clear. Whoever hired them is after something here in Abyss."
17690,"Balthus: Yeah, that's gotta be it. They must have been on a treasure hunt or something."
17691,Hapi: A treasure hunt here? I don't get it. What is there to find in these dingy tunnels?
17692,"Linhardt: Aelfric, was it? Looks like this is ringing a bell for you."
17693,"Aelfric: Well, something does come to mind, but the notion is preposterous at best."
17694,Claude: Never discount a wild hunch. Sometimes they're closer to the truth than you'd think.
17695,"Dimitri: Any lead will do, so long as it helps determine our next course of action. Please, go on."
17696,"Aelfric: As you wish, though again, it is quite far-fetched. You see, there is a longstanding legend here. It is said that deep underground, below even Abyss, is a place called the Chasm of the Bound wherein lies the Chalice of Beginnings."
17697,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Chalice of Beginnings?
Linhardt: I've never heard of it, but chances are it's some kind of sacred artifact belonging to the church.
Choice 2: The Chasm of the Bound?
Yuri: Huh. This is the first I've heard of it... So you believe Abyss is connected to that place?
Balthus: Lots of twists and turns down here, so it's not the craziest idea ever. Must be well hidden though."
17698,"Choice 1: The Chalice of Beginnings?
Linhardt: I've never heard of it, but chances are it's some kind of sacred artifact belonging to the church."
17699,"Linhardt: I've never heard of it, but chances are it's some kind of sacred artifact belonging to the church."

17702,"Balthus: Lots of twists and turns down here, so it's not the craziest idea ever. Must be well hidden though."
17703,"Aelfric: I once happened upon an old document that mentioned a ritual called the Rite of Rising. The text was incomplete, so I was unable to achieve a full understanding of the topic. I cannot even guarantee the authenticity of what I read. But it stated that the Chalice of Beginnings is a sacred object crafted by order of Saint Seiros herself. Saint Seiros apparently used the artifact to carry out the Rite of Rising, along with the Four Apostles."
17704,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What is the Rite of Rising?
Aelfric: It is a ritual that is believed to have the power to resurrect a life that was lost.
Choice 2: Who are the Four Apostles?
Linhardt: I vaguely recall reading about the Four Apostles. They were saints...and that's about all anyone knows. Hardly any records of them remain. Few alive even know their names, but these apostles supposedly assisted the Four Saints with their holy work.
Aelfric: It is also believed that Saint Seiros attempted to perform a resurrection using the chalice."
17705,"Choice 1: What is the Rite of Rising?
Aelfric: It is a ritual that is believed to have the power to resurrect a life that was lost."
17706,Aelfric: It is a ritual that is believed to have the power to resurrect a life that was lost.

17709,Aelfric: It is also believed that Saint Seiros attempted to perform a resurrection using the chalice.
17710,"Aelfric: However, the ritual failed... The Four Apostles bound the chalice so that it would never fall into a mortal's hands."
17711,"Claude: The Rite of Rising, eh? Hmm..."
17712,"Constance: Ah, yes, the chalice of legend! My father mentioned it to me a very long time ago. A secret treasure of the church... A chalice powerful enough to resurrect the dead... Exhilarating, no?"
17713,Dimitri: Quite. It is no small wonder that people are after it.
17714,"Edelgard: Even so, we still don't have much to go on. We must gather more information about this legend at once."
17715,"Aelfric: I wholeheartedly agree. I will do all I can to track down more clues within the monastery. Although, Garreg Mach's library is so...well curated, I doubt any further records will be found."
17716,Constance: Wondrous! We shall do all that we can as well.
17717,"Dimitri: Pardon the odd question, but something has been bothering me for a while now. Your hair...was it always that color?"
17718,"Edelgard: That is an odd question. But yes, if you must know, it was a different color when I was a child. How could you know that? Is it possible that we met before the academy?"
17719,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What are you two talking about?
Choice 2: Your hair changed color?"
17720,Choice 1: What are you two talking about?
17721,Choice 2: Your hair changed color?
17722,Edelgard: It’s...a long story. Now is not the time or place.
17723,"Dimitri: Yes, of course. My apologies."
17724,"Yuri: Well, well. The Imperial princess, the crown prince, and the next sovereign duke. Must be exhausting trying to suss out each other’s intentions, huh?"
17725,"Claude: Nah, we get along great. I mean, we kind of have no choice. A petty squabble could start an all-out war. And it doesn’t take a fancy title to have a hidden agenda. Isn’t that right, Yuri?"
17726,"Yuri: Cheeky...and off base. What do you think, friend? Do you think I’m off plotting nefarious deeds?"
17727,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yes, I do.
Yuri: Ha ha ha! Brutally honest… I love it.
Choice 2: No, I don’t.
Yuri: Ha ha! Not very perceptive, are we?"
17728,"Choice 1: Yes, I do.
Yuri: Ha ha ha! Brutally honest… I love it."
17729,Yuri: Ha ha ha! Brutally honest… I love it.
17730,"Choice 2: No, I don’t.
Yuri: Ha ha! Not very perceptive, are we?"
17731,"Yuri: Ha ha! Not very perceptive, are we?"
17732,"Yuri: Even so, that’s a bit much, wouldn’t you say? I do what I need to get by--nothing more than that. As for the others, they’ve all got their own struggles, but they’re nothing if not trustworthy."
17733,"Claude: Humbling yourself while promoting your friends… Gotta say, I don’t hate this side of you."
17734,"Yuri: Seems we’re in mutual neutrality of one another. I like that you keep your cards close. We’ll get along just fine, you and I."
17735,"Linhardt: The Four Apostles… Gah, this is killing me! I’m on the verge of remembering something. I can’t shake the feeling that one of their names is… also a food or something."
17736,"Ashe: I’ve only had the chance to speak with Aelfric briefly, but he seems like a respectable man. It’s obvious the whole town has a lot of affection for him. Kind of reminds me of Lonato in that way…"
17737,"Hilda: Had a chance to poke your head in here, Professor? It’s a fortune-teller’s room! Judging by all her mystical-looking doodads, I think she’s the real deal too. I wonder of she does matchmaking. Maybe she can help me sort through my countless suitors."
17738,"Balthus: I’ve got a lot of time on my hands down here, so I’ve been venturing even deeper underground. This place is loaded with winding paths and blocked-off tunnels. It’s a real maze. Only a few folks even know how to operate the gate mechanisms and hidden passages."
17739,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Gate mechanisms?
Balthus: That’s what I said. Activate the mechanism, and the gate slams shut. Bang!
Choice 2: Hidden passages?
Balthus: That’s what I said. Things will shift without notice here, revealing hidden passages. Walls. Floors. Everything. Gotta stay sharp."
17740,"Choice 1: Gate mechanisms?
Balthus: That’s what I said. Activate the mechanism, and the gate slams shut. Bang!"

17743,"Balthus: That’s what I said. Things will shift without notice here, revealing hidden passages. Walls. Floors. Everything. Gotta stay sharp."
17744,"Balthus: Actually, I’ll level with you. Yuri and Constance are much better about scoping out that kind of thing, heh."
17745,"Hapi: You’ve only been on the job for a few moons, hun? No wonder you don’t come off as a mindless church flunky. Plus, you don’t flap your trap all the time. I appreciate that. I hope you never change, no matter how many years you spend with the annoying people up there."
17746,"Constance: The records should be here some-- Oh! Hello, Professor. It’s good that you’ve come. I realized that I missed an opportunity to congratulate myself on my military achievements. But now that you’re here, I have an audience for it. Indulge me, won’t you? Ahaha! Behold the proof that the utmost honor in combat belongs to none other than I, Constance von Nuvelle! What a relief to get that off my chest! Now, where did Aelfric get to? I must have words with him."
17747,"Aelfric: The Ashen Wolves got their name from the beasts who guard the Blue Sea Star. The archbishop named the house herself, in fact. In spite of that, it seems she looks unfavorably upon our house of late. This saddens me greatly."
17748,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I’ve got something to report. The bandit sightings have stopped. For now. I still won’t let my guard down, though! What else… Notice how everyone’s in high spirits? Know why? I do. It’s because Master Aelfric is here. He’s real special, that one. He saved my life and lots of others here too. He’s earned some hero worship."
17749,"Mysterious Woman: There was a time when I did much fighting. Then I was captured. Then...I escaped. My home is far away now. My mother is waiting for me, but returning is… It is far away. I worry that I will be here until I am very old."
17750,Rogue: I heard Aelfric came to Yuri’s rescue in the attack that happened recently. That’s just what you’d expect from someone as kind and strong as he is. I can’t believe he’s single…
17751,"Rogue: Abyss is a sprawling place. Some houses, like mine, are actually quite far from the center of town. What brings me all the way here then, you ask? I came to see Aelfric. Even a glimpse of him is said to bring good luck."
17752,"Rogue: Don’t suppose you’re here for a drink, huh. They aren’t any better, I’ll tell ya right now. Maybe folks down here wouldn’t be so awful if they could get their hands on something worth tasting. Who am I kidding… Nobles are just as bad."
17753,"Boy: Sometimes Aelfric give out candy! Stick close by him, and you might get some too. But save a little for me, OK?"
17754,Girl: Don’t annoy Hapi or make her feel disappointed. You mustn’t. Not ever! OK?
17755,"Elderly Man: For folks who’ve lost their homes on the surface, Abyss is all they’ve got. Place used to be nothing more than a den of criminals who did whatever they pleased. Now, we’ve got Aelfric to keep an eye on things. He understands that keeping people fed’s the way to keep ‘em calm."
17756,Aelfric: The answer is no. I will not allow it. It is far too dangerous.
17757,"Constance: Ah, but if we can determine its origin, we may eliminate the very danger that vexes you!"
17758,"Balthus: You already know this, but there are plenty of folks down here who can't defend themselves. If these attacks keep up, eventually they'll find themselves in harm's way."
17759,"Aelfric: Yes, I am aware. However, for the time being, you must promise to refrain from acting recklessly. My dear flock has suffered enough as it is. You needn't take any further risks."
17760,"Hilda: Surprisingly overbearing, isn't he? He must really care about you guys."
17761,Constance: Most certainly. Yet if we fail to nip this problem in the bud...I shudder to think of what will transpire.
17762,"Constance: Aha, it's you! In the nick of time, as it were. Come, let us venture into the deep, deep underground. The chalice of legend awaits!"
17763,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're going underground?
Constance: But of course! Deeper and deeper still beneath the monastery, to the Chasm of the Bound.
Choice 2: The chalice..."
17764,"Choice 1: We're going underground?
Constance: But of course! Deeper and deeper still beneath the monastery, to the Chasm of the Bound."
17765,"Constance: But of course! Deeper and deeper still beneath the monastery, to the Chasm of the Bound."
17766,Choice 2: The chalice...
17767,"Hapi: Coco... You didn't hear a word Elfie said, did you?"
17768,"Constance: I surely did, but we must read between the lines. Aelfric wants a solution as badly as we do. And so, we shall seek out the Chalice of Beginnings and present it to the church! If our enemies desire the object, this should halt all future attacks on Abyss! Ahaha! Brilliant, no?"
17769,"Claude: I'm not so sure about that. According to legend, there's some kind of binding that protects it from would-be thieves. Even if we find it, we can't just walk up and take it unless we figure out how to break that thing."
17770,"Constance: Ah, but that is simplicity itself! We shall first ascertain whether it is still bound, and then... we shall release it!"
17771,"Balthus: But where is this chasm, anyway? I've never even heard of the place, much less seen it."
17772,"Constance: As luck would have it, I have discovered yet another secret passage! It appears to go deep underground. According to my superior instincts, it undoubtedly leads to the Chasm of the Bound!"
17773,"Yuri: Huh. I suppose it's worth a look. I don't care about finding some old cup, but if it could help us protect Abyss, I'll support the cause."
17774,"Constance: You surface dwellers do not have anything else to do at present, do you? You'll assist us, will you not?"
17775,"Byleth:
Choice 1: We're busy. Very busy.
Claude: Come on, Teach. We got plenty of time to follow them down that deep, dark tunnel. Admit it. Personally, I'm dying to find out more about this chasm and chalice business.
Choice 2: We'll go with you.
Linhardt: I don't have anything scheduled before my next nap, so I guess that's fine. Edelgard doesn't look too thrilled, though..."

17780,Constance: Ahaha! Splendid! It is decided. We leave at once.
17781,Linhardt: *yawns* Feeling pretty lost right now. How long have we been walking? I'm guessing a full week.
17782,Hapi: A week? Ridiculous. It's been a few hours at most.
17783,"Edelgard: Exaggerations aside, if this takes much longer, I'm concerned about our lack of food and water."
17784,"Claude: She's got a point. How about we trek a bit farther, and if we don't find anything, we turn back?"
17785,Dimitri: Constance... I find it rather curious how quickly you became fixated on the chalice. Care to explain?
17786,"Constance: Oh, I... No. Why would I be fixated on a silly little legend...for some supposed ulterior motive? Ahaha..."
17787,"Yuri: Ha, you want the esteem. You think this will convince the church to help you restore your fallen house."
17788,Constance: Uh! How could you possibly know that?! Have you been snooping within the confines of my very mind?!
17789,"Yuri: ""I shall restore House Nuvelle to its former glory at all costs!"" Haha! It's practically your catchphrase."
17790,Linhardt: Aha! Just as I suspected. Constance is the former lady of House Nuvelle.
17791,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What is House Nuvelle?
Choice 2: You know House Nuvelle?"
17792,Choice 1: What is House Nuvelle?
17793,Choice 2: You know House Nuvelle?
17794,"Linhardt: Until just a few years ago, it was a house of viscounts in the west of the Empire. They had a long and distinguished history."
17795,"Edelgard: House Nuvelle lost its status five years ago, as a result of their part in the war."
17796,Constance: Huh. You speak as though it has nothing to do with you.
17797,"Edelgard: I fear all I can do is ask forgiveness in place of my useless father. If doing so will comfort you in any way, then please accept my--"
17798,"Constance: Save your breath. That will not be necessary. There is only one thing that I desire. For the sake of my parents...who fell courageously and selflessly in defense of the Empire... For them, I shall restore our status, revive House Nuvelle, and return it to its former glory! All that I do, even spending each day advancing my magical prowess, is to that end."
17799,"Hapi: And in reward for all that hard work, you were forced to live underground. Life's cruel. It's like you took a shortcut back to the starting line. Or maybe you're just unlucky."
17800,Constance: What are you saying?! I never intended to share... that side of me with you...
17801,Balthus: Look at that! It's a good thing we didn't turn back. That looks mighty chasm-like if you ask me.
17802,Dimitri: Say... Are we beneath the bridge at the monastery? Incredible...
17803,"Claude: Huh. I never thought I'd be gazing up at that bridge we've crossed a thousand times from way, way down below."
17804,Yuri: Are we sure this is the right place?
17805,Constance: It is. I think. I believe. I...hope?
17806,"Edelgard: Constance, why are you hiding in the shade? Aren't you the one who insisted that we find the chalice?"
17807,"Constance: Fine! If you insist that I join you, then I shall. Satisfied?!"
17808,Constance: ... Oh my. I was quite rude just now... Please accept my humble apologies for treating you so foully. I presumed too much to stand beside such noble paragons. Allow me to dig a hole to bury myself in...
17809,"Balthus: Ugh... No matter how deep underground we are, I guess sunlight is still sunlight. Poor Constance."
17810,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What's going on?
Chocie 2: She's not her usual self..."
17811,Choice 1: What's going on?
17812,Chocie 2: She's not her usual self...
17813,Hapi: This is what Coco's like in the sun. That's why she lives underground.
17814,Constance: I fear I cannot guarantee that this is the Chasm of the Bound. I have almost surely wasted our time.
17815,"Balthus: Enough with the self-doubt, yeah? Just put one foot in front of the other. We'll have you back in the shadows before you know it."
17816,"Hapi: Cheer up, Coco. We need you."
17817,Constance: And now I have forced you into a state of pity. I feel so very worthless.
17818,"Dimitri: I admit, I have never seen anything quite like this before. Is there nothing we can do to help?"
17819,"Balthus: Hapi, keep Constance moving. If we don't start searching, we'll never find that damn chalice."
17820,"Hapi: Fine. I'll just push her a bit, I guess..."
17821,"Constance: I must ask you to cease. You shall soil your hands upon my filthy back. No soap could possibly-- Huh? This feeling... I sense magic in the air. There is something just ahead. The binding spell, perhaps..."
17822,"Linhardt: I don't feel anything at all... Wait. Actually, I hear something. Something big. And it's moving."
17823,Edelgard: Perhaps there is something in place that is guarding the chalice.
17824,Claude: Yikes! What is that thing? It's like some kind of gigantic toy.
17825,"Yuri: I don't have the slightest idea what's going on, but I know it doesn't bode well."
17826,"Balthus: I dunno. Could be fun. It's been a while since I've met an enemy that could put up a good fight! Hey, you! Meet your master, pal! I'm gonna pummel you into my own personal shield!"
17827,"Balthus: What’s the deal? No matter how many we squash, more just take their place."
17828,"Linhardt: Hmm… If those things were created to protect the chalice, there must be a way to deactivate them."
17829,"Constance: If I may presume to offer my opinion, the statues may warrant scrutiny."
17830,"Hapi: Hmm, there must be a way to activate those things. I bet they require some kind of key…"
17831,Marcelle: You who befoul this sacred place--leave now or perish!
17832,"Balthus: Sacred place? Sounds like the Chasm of the Bound, all right."
17833,Hilda: I think I may have found the key. That thing over there is carrying it around.
17834,Yuri: Huh… There’s clearly something special about this key. Better keep it safe.
17835,Golem: Vanquish the fools!
17836,Constance: Our failure to use caution is most regrettable. I’m certainly paying the price for it now…
17837,"Claude: One key, multiple keyholes… Must be a fellow schemer!"
17838,Edelgard: Agreed. This is just the sort of trap your crafty brain would dream up.
17839,Ashe: What?! This one’s a trap too… How are we supposed to tell them apart?
17840,Dimitri: Only one left. Hopefully we can finally put a stop to this madness!
17841,"Yuri: Close call, but we did it. Our efforts paid off."
17842,Hapi: There’s something drawn on the rock over there. They look like Crests… Whoa! What’s going on?
17843,"Constance: My Crest! Oh, but look at the stone. There’s light streaming from it."
17844,Claude: Look! There's something in that opening!
17845,Constance: Oh! Can it be?
17846,Balthus: Is that...
17847,Constance: You would know best. It is beyond my ken whether that is the chalice. Curse my ignorance!
17848,"Balthus: Answer the question, will ya? Is it or isn't it?"
17849,"Constance: That quaking earlier... Some kind of containment magic related to the Crests was in place here. Whether intentionally or not, the chalice was released. I hesitate to suggest that those things were the cause. Oh, perhaps one of our Crests was the key to unbinding the chalice..."
17850,Hapi: Care to summarize that?
17851,"Constance: My apologies. I have caused you undue vexation by speaking so incomprehensibly. Were I to venture a tentative guess, I would say that this is, indeed, the Chalice of Beginnings."
17852,"Balthus: You could have just said, ""This is it, all right!"""
17853,"Linhardt: Forgotten Crests resembling those of the Four Apostles, depicted on a sealed rock wall... Objects that resemble holy armaments and a chalice that gathers magic all on its own... I don't know of any other legends that cover all of that, so this must be the chalice we're looking for."
17854,Constance: A thousand thank-yous for covering my own inadequacy with such a competent explanation.
17855,Edelgard: I'm still not used to hearing you speak in such a manner...
17856,"Constance: Forgive me, Your Highness. If I have displeased you, please take my life as a small gesture of atonement."
17857,"Claude: Oh, Your Highest of Highnesses, I doth humbly beg of thee to find forgiveness within your royal heart."
17858,"Edelgard: Stop fooling around, Claude. And, Constance, I assure you, there is nothing to forgive."
17859,Constance: Hm?
17860,Dimitri: I hear thunder. Rain is soon to follow.
17861,Yuri: We'd better head back to Abyss before the storm hits us.
17862,Constance: ... Ugh! It happened yet again. Why must my good intentions always--
17863,Constance: Huh? What was that sound?! It cannot be...

17884,"Constance: Oh, my poor, abused legs! I have been remiss to neglect my lower...body exercise as of late..."
17885,Yuri: Don't give up--we're almost back to Abyss! What a damn mess we've gotten ourselves into...
17886,"Hapi: We should give up. Just throw the chalice at the big one and be done with it. It doesn't seem like they're gonna ease off. If that doesn't work, I guess we're dead."
17887,Constance: Ahaha! I think not! I shall never surrender! I shall not die until I have achieved my glorious aim!
17888,Balthus: For crying out loud... Those creepy toy things must love a good chase. They won't let up!
17889,"Yuri: Not to mention the enemies that look like phantoms. Further measures to protect the chalice, I'm sure. Maybe Hapi's right, and this won't stop so long as we have the artifact."
17890,"Ashe: We can't lead them back to Abyss, or the people there will be in danger!"
17891,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Let's fight them.
Yuri: Agreed. But first, let's run a bit farther. I know a good place to keep the enemy at bay.
Choice 2: There's nothing we can do.
Yuri: Are you daft, or is this a test? We obviously need to lead our enemy somewhere that gives us the advantage and then face them head on!
Choice 3: Let's give it back.
Hapi: Good call. Are you OK with that, Yuri-bird?
Yuri: Of course not! Let's keep running just a bit longer. I know a good place to keep the enemy at bay."

17898,Yuri: Of course not! Let's keep running just a bit longer. I know a good place to keep the enemy at bay.
17899,Balthus: Oh yeah! The gates! They're so damn sturdy I nearly broke my priceless fist on one once.
17900,Constance: You punched one? Like a brute?! Ugh! Why must you always behave in such an infantile manner?
17901,"Hapi: He probably thought that was the best way to test its sturdiness. He doesn't have bad intentions, he's just that dumb."
17902,"Yuri: Balthus. If you broke the mechanism, I'm sacrificing you to the creepy doll."
17903,"Edelgard: The enemy’s caught up to us. If we try to go up against it, we’re finished."
17904,"Balthus: That thing’s worse than what we saw at the chasm. Looks strong enough to flatten me. Me, of all people!"
17905,"Dimitri: Argh, the gate! Even I won’t be able to force it open."
17906,"Yuri: Heh heh. This is bad. There’s more where that came from too. C’mon, let’s go--now!"
17907,"Constance: Oh my. I believe this to be a shortcut, but the way seems closed."
17908,Hapi: Who wants to do us a favor and pull the lever? Though you might get left behind…
17909,Balthus: That passage over there is blocked too. I believe the controls for it are on the other side at the far end.
17910,"Claude: It really closed, didn’t it? Good thing we made it through in time."
17911,Yuri: Keep moving. That was just the first of these things.
17912,"Bandit: You’ll not be getting away, ya hear? Fork it over!"
17913,"Hilda: Ugh, more baddies? I’m already soaking in sweat. Read the room, lady!"
17914,"Balthus: Holst will kill me if anything happens to you. Be careful, yeah?"
17915,Bandit: Whoa! Just like the boss said. They came back!
17916,Bandit: Did you find the treasure-majig? Treasure thingy? Whatever it’s called! Doesn’t matter. Hand it over.
17917,Constance: These bandits are discussing treasure… How much can they have surmised?
17918,"Hapi: No idea. All I know is they’re here, so we’re gonna have to fight them."
17919,Yuri: Shame…
17920,"Edelgard: The gate closed. Hurry, everyone! No time to dawdle."
17921,Yuri: Heh. That takes care of that. And last but not least…
17922,"Linhardt: Run through this gate, open that one, run through another one. Sheesh. That’s enough gates to last me a lifetime. I’m overdue for some shuteye…"
17923,Constance: All is well though! We’ve safely retrieved the Chalice of Beginnings.
17924,"Yuri: Well, that was awful. I'm never going back down there, that's for damn sure."
17925,"Balthus: Ha! With things like that wandering around, you couldn't even if you wanted to."
17926,"Byleth:
Choice 1: It was a valuable learning experience.
Yuri: Aren't you optimistic. There were a few times I was sure we were done for.
Choice 2: I was pretty sure we were going to die.

17927,"Choice 1: It was a valuable learning experience.

17930,Balthus: Not sure I believe you. You were pretty calm that whole time.
17931,Constance: Has Aelfric yet returned? We must present the chalice to the church at once!

17936,"Rogue: Underground? But we are underground! Anyway, things are bad! Really bad!"
17937,Rogue: Some strangers from the outside have kidnapped Master Aelfric!
17938,Constance: Aelfric? No! It cannot be true!
17939,Rogue: It happened as soon as he returned from the monastery. Bandits were lying in wait.
17940,Balthus: Dammit! How could this happen?!
17941,Constance: This was clearly premeditated. I am certain it is connected to the bandits we fended off earlier.
17942,Yuri: Have you alerted the church?
17943,"Rogue: Not yet. It all happened so suddenly... Do you think we should? Can we trust them? If we cause too much trouble, Abyss is doomed..."
17944,"Yuri: Now isn't the time to worry about that! We're in no position to cover something like this up. The church has eyes and ears everywhere, so they may already know what's going on. Either way, go and tell them the news. Now."
17945,Rogue: Sure thing! Understood!
17946,"Yuri: Also, if anyone was wounded, send them here. We'll patch them up with healing magic. Wait... Where's Hapi? And Linhardt?"
17947,Constance: Hapi! Wherever did you disappear to! Aelfric has been--
17948,Hapi: I know. Take a look at this.
17949,Balthus: What's that? Looks like some kind of fancy letter.
17950,"Hapi: That's because it is. It was lying in the classroom. ""We have abducted Cardinal Aelfric. We can guarantee his safety, for now. If you want to help him, meet us tomorrow evening in the ruins of the old chapel. Bring the chalice. Know that if you alert the knights, the cardinal's life will be forfeit."""
17951,Byleth: Could it be...
17952,Balthus: No doubt about it. This letter must have been left by the people who abducted Aelfric.
17953,"Constance: Then our enemy really is after the chalice. All the while, they were waiting for us to locate it for them. No... No! Something about this does not ring true!"
17954,"Hapi: None of it rings true, so which part in particular are you talking about?"
17955,Constance: How did the enemy know we were searching for the chalice to begin with? This can only mean that someone in Abyss is--
17956,Yuri: You smell a rat. Someone who notified the church of our plan. It's no good talking about theoretical rats right now. First we have to deal with the problem at hand.
17957,Constance: Too true. For once you are speaking reasonably.
17958,"Edelgard: The identities of the cardinals are a closely guarded secret of the church. Yet Aelfric’s status was disclosed in that letter. Could this signal a power struggle within the church? Or perhaps that’s what they want us to believe. Either way, we should pay close attention."
17959,"Dimitri: According to the legend that Aelfric shared with us, the chalice has the power to bring back the dead. Are his captors hoping to resurrect someone? Hmm. Or perhaps they simply intend to sell it for an exorbitant payoff…"
17960,"Claude: So it turns out ol’ Aelfric is a cardinal, huh? Hard to imagine such an important figure getting abducted. And whoever took him somehow knows we have the chalice. I bet they know how to use the thing too. I doubt they just plan to decorate their mantle with it."
17961,"Linhardt: I was speaking with Hapi earlier, and it dawned on me that she may possess a unique Crest. Perhaps it’s linked to the Four Apostles. If so, then in the chasm… No. There isn’t enough to back that up. Hm? Oh, sorry, Professor. I need to think on this longer before sharing my theories."
17962,Ashe: Aelfric’s been taken hostage… Who could do such a dishonorable thing? It doesn’t matter. Abyss needs him. We’ve got to form a rescue party. I just hope we’re not getting in over our heads. We don’t exactly know what we’re dealing with.
17963,"Hilda: We were hoping the chalice would protect Abyss, but it’s the reason Aelfric got captured. That’s ironic. The people here really adore him. I’m sure they’d appreciate our help getting him back. Then again, are we getting too involved? Maybe we should leave before we make things any worse."
17964,Yuri: Things were dicey for a bit there. Gotta say I’m relieved that no harm befell anyone in Abyss. I’ve made sure that the elderly and children are hidden in their homes. They need to stay safe.
17965,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What can I do to help?
Yuri: Nothing for now. But I might call on you for a favor later.
Choice 2: Smart move.
Yuri: Comes naturally to me. When I say jump, my rogues jump. That’s why they call me boss."
17966,"Choice 1: What can I do to help?
Yuri: Nothing for now. But I might call on you for a favor later."
17967,Yuri: Nothing for now. But I might call on you for a favor later.

Yuri: Comes naturally to me. When I say jump, my rogues jump. That’s why they call me boss."
17969,"Yuri: Comes naturally to me. When I say jump, my rogues jump. That’s why they call me boss."
17970,Yuri: So that’s the deal. People are safe for now. But I can’t shake the feeling that something’s just...off. All we can do at this point is focus on the problem staring us in the face.
17971,"Balthus: You ask me, we can’t expect to just mosey on by, hand over the chalice, and make it out alive. Nothing sounds better than saving Aelfric and roughing up the jerks who took him. It’s just… Well, as the Relentless King of Grappling, I’ll be fine. But I’m worried about the others."
17972,"Hapi: We’ve gotta get Elfie back. I was abducted once, when I was younger. My captor used me as a test subject in her twisted experiments. Maybe we can just give them the chalice and they’ll release him unharmed."
17973,"Constance: Might I have a word? It concerns the blackguards who abducted Aelfric. I alluded to it before, but I sincerely believe there is a spy in Abyss."
17974,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I doubt that.
Constance: I see… Well, I shall drop the matter if you think it best.
Choice 2: I think you’re right.
Constance: We’re in agreement, then?"
17975,"Choice 1: I doubt that.
Constance: I see… Well, I shall drop the matter if you think it best."
17976,"Constance: I see… Well, I shall drop the matter if you think it best."
17977,"Choice 2: I think you’re right.
Constance: We’re in agreement, then?"
17978,"Constance: We’re in agreement, then?"
17979,"Constance: Yuri is exceedingly devoted to his friends, but there are times that he can be a bit too trusting."
17980,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I’ve got something to report. And it’s me. I...I’m a failure. A farce. An insult to the noble title of Abysskeeper. Master Aelfric’s done so much for me. I wanted to pay him back one day, but instead...I let this happen. I’ll never make this up to him. Ugh! I’m disgusted with myself! Don’t look at me--I’m a monster."
17981,"Mysterious Woman: I have seen nothing. I have been here in this place, where I always am. You cannot think it was me who did something. I am full of innocence!"
17982,"Elderly Man: Aelfric is a prominent figure in the church. If the Archbishop hears what happened, she might send the Knights of Seiros. That’d make things complicated. Folks down here don’t trust ‘em."
17983,"Rogue: The Ashen Wolves are strong. I don’t think even they can do this on their own… You’ll lend them a hand, won’t you, Professor? Please, save Aelfric!"
17984,"Rogue: It’s gotten pretty dangerous around here, so we’ve sent all the children back to their homes. I hope Aelfric’s all right…"
17985,Rogue: The leader of the group that took Aelfric… I’ve seen him before. He wouldn’t hesitate to slaughter an entire town… if he stood to gain even a little by it. His laugh chills me to the bone…
17986,"Rogue: It all happened so fast. They forced their way in and took Aelfric. There was nothing I could do. We all wanted to fight, but Aelfric stopped us. He always thinks of others first...even if it means sacrificing himself."
17987,Claude: We really lucked out there. Fewer injuries than I would have expected...and most were minor.
17988,Dimitri: I suppose the only conclusion we can draw is that they really were after Aelfric all this time...
17989,Edelgard: Perhaps they were instructed to avoid unnecessary casualties...
17990,Hilda: Is that Aelfric guy really a cardinal? Are the secret cardinals really a thing? I thought that was a myth.
17991,Linhardt: Hard to believe. Did you folks in the Ashen Wolves know that?
17992,"Balthus: Nah, that's news to me. The identity of the cardinals is top secret, even within the church. He never would have told us something like that. Oh, except maybe Yuri..."
17993,"Yuri: He and I talk about a lot of things. But right now, I'd say we have more important topics to discuss than his title. Aelfric's been kidnapped. What are we going to do about it?"
17994,"Constance: Even if it is in the name of rescuing him, we simply cannot hand over the chalice to those scoundrels!"
17995,Hapi: Let's just give them the thing and be done with it.
17996,Alois: Professor! I came as fast as I could when I heard the report. I had no idea you'd be here!
17997,"Yuri: Is this loud...uh, excitable knight a friend of yours?"
17998,"Byleth:
Choice 1: He's a friend of my father's.
Alois: Precisely so! I'm Alois, right-hand man to the former captain of the Knights of Seiros, Jeralt!
Constance: Oh my. That means our professor here is the child of a captain!
Choice 2: He's a trusted friend.
Alois: You humble me, Professor! I'm Alois. I serve the church as a knight of Seiros.
Choice 3: I don't know this man.

18001,Constance: Oh my. That means our professor here is the child of a captain!
18002,"Choice 2: He's a trusted friend.
Alois: You humble me, Professor! I'm Alois. I serve the church as a knight of Seiros."
18003,"Alois: You humble me, Professor! I'm Alois. I serve the church as a knight of Seiros."
18004,"Choice 3: I don't know this man.
Alois: Professor! I love a good joke myself, but that one was rather cruel, don't you think?"
18005,"Alois: Professor! I love a good joke myself, but that one was rather cruel, don't you think?"
18006,"Alois: Now, about Aelfric's kidnapping... Since he's an important member of the church, we must use any means necessary to find him. That said...most of the holy knights have been deployed to deal with the Western Church."
18007,"Balthus: Sure, but any knights are better than no knights, yeah?"
18008,"Alois: I like your attitude, though I'm still embarrassed that we're not in full force... But hey, at least we're quite forceful!"
18009,"Yuri: Ugh. Here, take this letter. We believe it was left by whoever kidnapped the cardinal. In it, the enemy clearly spells out their plan. They're after a chalice that was hidden beneath Abyss."
18010,"Alois: A chalice, hm? A chalice... Hmmm... Ah! Do you mean THE chalice?! But no, why would it be there? I've never heard anything about it being stowed away in Abyss."
18011,"Balthus: Then this is gonna come as a shock, pal."
18012,Alois: What in the goddess's name?! Is that really the chalice from the legends?!
18013,"Constance: The probability of that is unassailably high, yes."
18014,"Hapi: It was guarded by a bunch of giant, creepy toys. There was powerful magic protecting it and everything."
18015,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Please believe us.
Choice 2: I saw it with my own eyes."
18016,Choice 1: Please believe us.
18017,Choice 2: I saw it with my own eyes.
18018,"Alois: If you say so. Wow, that means the story about the chalice being bound was true. Well, what's done is done! Oh, but I guess it's not done just yet. I must report this to Lady Rhea at once!"

18044,"Rhea: So that is what transpired... This is, indeed, the Chalice of Beginnings. It matches the descriptions in the few records of it that remain."
18045,Yuri: Don't beat around the bush. What's our punishment?
18046,"Rhea: You removed a most sacred treasure. Truly it is my obligation to mete out punishment for that transgression. However... You also helped the church locate a valuable artifact. In light of this good deed, I shall forgive the bad one. I do wonder..."
18047,Byleth: What's on your mind?
18048,"Rhea: I am wondering whether your presence had anything to do with the artifact's unbinding, Professor. As per the church chronicles, the Four Apostles secured the chalice with powerful magic. The only way to release the chalice is by using the four Crests passed down through their bloodlines. However, given the special power you possess, perhaps you were able to unlock it yourself. There is no knowing at present. For the time being, I will keep the chalice somewhere safe. As for Aelfric, I assure you that the knights will find and return him in due time. I consider him to be one of my many children, after all. I will not allow harm to befall him."
18049,"Constance: Lady Rhea, might I ask a moment of your time? We cannot be expected to give up our endeavor! The enemy stated most clearly that if the knights are involved, our deal Aelfric is finished! We owe him so much. If there is any possibility that his life is in danger, the risk is too great to chance!"
18050,"Hapi: True. The knights are strong and all, but they're liable to get him killed. We can take care of it. With Chatterbox's help."
18051,"Balthus: Our professor has the strength of a hundred knights, or about one and a half of me. We've got this. How about it, Rhea? We've been through too damned much to get here. Leave the chalice and Aelfric to us. You won't regret it."
18052,Yuri: Lady Rhea... Please.
18053,Rhea: Hmm...
18054,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Give them a shot.
Choice 2: I'll take full responsibility."
18055,Choice 1: Give them a shot.
18056,Choice 2: I'll take full responsibility.
18057,"Rhea: If you consent to join your power with theirs... Yes, perhaps there is hope. As you wish. I shall entrust you with the chalice."
18058,"Knight of Seiros: Your Grace, the chalice is a legendary treasure! You can't just hand it over to those underground--"
18059,"Rhea: That is quite enough. There is no cause to worry, I assure you. There will be no further discussion on the matter. Even if we lost hold of the chalice, it would be impossible for the thieves to make use of it. Though it was created to return a life that was lost, I doubt that anyone alive knows how to accomplish that feat. If someone were to successfully replicate the ritual... It would perhaps be the work of fate."
18060,"Balthus: Hey, Boss. Been meaning to ask--how'd you end up down here in Abyss?"
18061,"Yuri: What is this, some sort of interrogation?"
18062,"Hapi: Yeah, you've never been big on sharing. I mean, you know all about me, and there's still so much I don't know about you."
18063,"Balthus: Look, I get it. Talking about the past isn't easy. But I'm curious, yeah? So get to it. I've got all day."
18064,Yuri: Do you now? Heh heh. Well. I guess now's as good as a time as any to tell you. I'm here because I killed some people from the church.
18065,Constance: That cannot be!
18066,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean by that?
Choice 2: You have a grudge against the church?"
18067,Choice 1: What do you mean by that?
18068,Choice 2: You have a grudge against the church?
18069,"Yuri: Originally, I attended the academy as Count Rowe's adopted kid. There came a point when the church ordered me to wipe out some members from my old gang. Told me it was part of some important mission."
18070,"Constance: Who is this ""old gang"" you speak of?"
18071,"Yuri: They were nothing more than common thieves to someone like you, Constance. Anyway, they're like family to me, so naturally I protested my orders. Things got pretty heated and, well...the rest is history."
18072,"Balthus: That's some story, pal. You're damn lucky they didn't execute you."
18073,"Yuri: Heh, you're telling me. Aelfric stepped in and implored them to spare my life, told them to consider the circumstances. It's not so different for the rest of you. I'm sure he helped all of us out in different ways."
18074,"Hapi: He did. I was about to be thrown in the monastery's underground jail... People thought I was dangerous, what with my ""gift"" and all. It's dark and dingy here, but it sure beats a prison cell. Elfie really saved my neck."
18075,"Constance: Back to the point--Balthus, what was it you were so curious about? You had ideas regarding why our enemies may be clawing after the chalice, perhaps?"
18076,"Balthus: Nah, nothing like that. But I am hung up on something Rhea said. That binding on the chalice was linked to the Four Apostles, yeah? I know I've got Chevalier's--"
18077,"Linhardt: Sorry, but mind if I cut in?"
18078,Hapi: What is it? Can't you see we're busy?
18079,"Linhardt: I can. But I just remembered something. Something important. Specifically, the names of the Apostles. Aubin, Chevalier, Noa, and Timotheos. The four apostles whose bloodlines were lost to time. I figured the Ashen Wolves might have thoughts about all that."
18080,Constance: Uh... Mm...
18081,"Balthus: No use hiding it now, Constance. Let's lay all of our cards on the table. As for me, I've got the Major Crest of Chevalier. When I enrolled at the academy, the church ordered me to keep that tidbit to myself. So I did."
18082,Yuri: Mm-hm. And I've got the Major Crest of Aubin. Never did sort out how I have this thing.
18083,"Constance: As for me, the blood of Saint Noa courses through my veins. This is kept hidden, even from the Empire."
18084,Hapi: Which probably means mine's from Timotheos. I do have a vague recollection of being told my Crest is rare.
18085,"Edelgard: So the four Crests, which were presumed lost, have all been gathered into the same house."
18086,"Claude: All thanks to our buddy Aelfric, it would seem."
18087,"Dimitri: And now Aelfric has been abducted. Why could that be? If it was the chalice they were after, they could have stolen it from us without the need for anything sly."
18088,Balthus: Maybe someone had it out for him. Or maybe he messed around with the wrong people.
18089,"Yuri: Or it could just be unrelated entirely. We're trying to untangle this mess by tying more knots into it. I mean, Balthus, you landed here on accident, didn't you? It's not like that's linked to the rest of us. And I could just as easily have never ended up down here, you know? You're jumping at shadows. Anyway, we don't have time for this. Let's get our act together and head for the chapel ruins."
18090,"Edelgard: The descendants of the Four Apostles... Fascinating. To think that their bloodlines carried on in secret. Right under our noses, one was even disguised as Imperial nobility... House Nuvelle was thought to be descended from Saint Macuil, but that was a fabrication. How did they manage to avoid detection for so many generations?"
18091,"Dimitri: The lost Crests... Aelfric's objective... Since our journey's outset, the mystery has only deepened. Ah, please forgive me. Musing aloud isn't going to get us anywhere. For now, let's finish our preparations. I fear a battle is imminent."
18092,"Claude: Those losts Crests... They must all have their own Relics, don't you think? Eh, but before we dig into a new mystery, we'd better figure out the ones we're already working on. I have a theory, but... Actually, scratch that. No use guessing when our answers await at the chapel ruins."
18093,"Linhardt: Huh. I can't believe my wild hypothesis was correct. I may not look it, but I'm shocked. It's like casting a line and thinking you've landed the Big One...but then you reel it in and it's Seteth. OK, that was a weird analogy. The point is I'm very, very shocked."
18094,"Ashe: To be honest, I'm surprised Lady Rhea was so willing to just...hand over the chalice like that. Doesn't the church consider it important? I know she said they wouldn't be able to use it, but something doesn't feel right."
18095,"Hilda: We go to all that trouble bringing Lady Rhea a priceless artifact, and not so much as a thank-you? We had to release the binding and everything. Well, I mean, it kind of released on its own--but still! Let's wrap this up and head home so I can get some quality sauna time. Hilda needs a steaming."
18096,"Yuri: I suppose it's all out in the open. Now you know just what I'm capable of. The church would have destroyed me ages ago if it wasn't for a certain someone having my back. My life was spared... It's a debt I intend to pay, no matter the cost."
18097,"Balthus: Ah! My head's gonna explode if I keep thinking about all this complicated junk. For now, we just need to focus on rescuing Aelfric and sniffing out some answers. I know it's been one crisis after another, but you're still game to help us, yeah? We need you, pal."
18098,"Constance: Is Aelfric an enemy or an ally? He's worked tirelessly to protect Abyss for years and years. Yet had House Nuvelle not met such a terrible fate, I would never have come to Garreg Mach. And Noa's bloodline would never... Can his kidnapping really be a simple coincidence? Or..."
18099,"Hapi: The Four Apostles... Finally, it makes sense."
18100,"Byleth:
Choice 1: What do you mean?
Hapi: I never understood why my village was hidden away from the rest of the world. But now I finally get it. What a relief.
Choice 2: Oh, yeah. For sure.
Hapi: You don't even know what I was going to say. Nobody likes a faker."

18104,Hapi: You don't even know what I was going to say. Nobody likes a faker.
18105,"Abysskeeper: Hey, you. Listen up. I've got something to report. Guess that's pretty usual here. Maybe it's not worth reporting? Perhaps I should say...nothing to report? Nah. Tried it on, doesn't feel right. In any case, about Master Aelfric... Bring him back to us, OK? For my part, I'll look after things down here. If our enemy shows up, I'll stay by my post! I mean, I have to eat and stuff, but I'll come right back. Count on it."
18106,Mysterious Woman: There is danger here because we could be attacked. But the same danger is there for me on the surface. The only way to leave the danger is to disappear.
18107,"Elderly Man: If Aelfric dies, Abyss'll go right back to being the garbage dump it was before. Won't matter too much for an old codger like myself, but... Ah, but the kids... It'd be hard to see their hopes for the future crushed."
18108,"Boy: It was surface people who took Aelfric away. But you're from the surface too. Maybe only...some surface people are the worst. Anyway, good luck!"
18109,"Girl: The Ashen Wolves can take on anything. They'll make sure it all turns out OK, won't they?"
18110,"Rogue: If the church knows that Aelfric's been abducted, why haven't the Knights of Seiros done anything? I know you're all doing your best. I just hope it'll be enough. We can't afford to lose him."
18111,"Rogue: Yuri somehow always keeps his cool. He's closer with Aelfric than anyone, so he's got the most reason to be upset... I'm sure he's just really good at hiding the same feelings we're all having."
18112,"Rogue: Maybe you think this is a bad time to talk about what we drink down here... But I'm gonna anyway. See, the problem isn't in the local ingredients. It's what's getting shipped in that's the issue. With the right equipment, we could probably make our own. Cut out the need to import anything... Hell, maybe we could even export some of it! As soon as Aelfric's back, I'm gonna see what he thinks of the idea. So, uh...make sure Aelfric comes back safe, all right?"
18113,"Yuri: Hey, friend."
18114,"Yuri: Let's not deny that there's a connection between us. How about you and me have ourselves a little date, huh?"
18115,"Byleth:

18127,"Yuri: Nobles have nearly killed one another fighting for my affections, you know. Perhaps you won't get all you want out of me, heh, but I'll promise you a fun time regardless. It's settled. I'll see you tomorrow night, friend. Don't stand me up."
18128,"Priest: Your Grace, please reconsider. The chalice is among the church's greatest treasures, akin even to the Heroes' Relics."
18129,"Rhea: I am well aware, which is why I have already dealt with the matter. Consider this, the Heroes' Relics are fearsome weapons imbued with great power. On the contrary, the chalice has long lost the power it once possessed. It is little more than a token of history."
18130,"Priest: If that is so, then why is it still considered such an important artifact?"
18131,Rhea: It was created for a sacred purpose. To use the blood of the Four Apostles to...return the goddess to our world. Their blood...
18132,Priest: Your Grace? Is something the matter?
18133,Rhea: I have an urgent mission for you. Investigate the origins of the Ashen Wolves. Start with their enrollment forms for the academy. Keep an eye out for falsified documents.
18134,"Priest: Yes, of course. Understood."
18135,"Rhea: Before you begin, summon Alois at once. I have new orders for the knights as well."
18136,"Priest: As you wish, Your Grace."
18137,"Rhea: If I am correct, we haven't a moment to lose. Another tragedy is soon to transpire..."
18138,Balthus: That crumbly old chapel somewhere nearby or what?
18139,"Constance: I can play little part here, save perhaps as a bargaining chip for our dear Aelfric..."
18140,"Ashe: Getting yourself captured instead? That wouldn't be good at all, Constance!"
18141,"Hapi: I think we should be more worried about B's... appearance. I mean, he's got way, WAY more, uh...life experience than the rest of us. And all that life experience makes you look more like a knight than a student, B."
18142,"Balthus: You saying I'm old, pal? Don't forget you're speaking to the Ageless King of Grappling."
18143,"Hilda: She's not wrong, Baltie. There's a pretty big age gap between you two."
18144,"Edelgard: You're friends with Hilda's older brother, right? That explains your...maturity. You make Hubert look like a spring chicken."
18145,"Balthus: Can it, will ya? Anyway, I'm wearing a school uniform. No way in hell they'll think I'm a knight."
18146,"Yuri: Yeah, and anyone wearing a school uniform is without a doubt a student."
18147,"Ashe: To be honest, for a good while, I actually did think you might be a knight... Who made your uniforms and set up the Ashen Wolf House, anyhow?"
18148,"Constance: If I might so humbly interject, that would be Aelfric."
18149,"Yuri: He pulled everything together for us...some time after he was appointed as the guardian of Abyss. Said he wanted to give former students who were expelled from the academy somewhere to live. Somewhere to belong. Of course, all of this was established long before any of us were in the picture."
18150,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Seems like he really cares about people.
Ashe: It does. Whatever his aims, it seems he has quite a few noble qualities.
Choice 2: So getting you four together was a coincidence?
Edelgard: Perhaps. After hearing all of that, it's not as unbelievable as I'd thought."

18155,"Hapi: All I know is that he helped me, so I'll help him."
18156,"Constance: I strongly doubt that I shall factor into Aelfric's retrieval, but I shall follow your lead."
18157,"Balthus: There it is. We owe Aelfric. Maybe your goddess doesn't care about debts, but my fists and I sure do."
18158,"Yuri: Sorry to have roped you into all this, friend."
18159,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I don't mind.
Yuri: We owe you. Just stick with us a bit longer, won't you?

18168,Yuri: How cheeky. Me? Never. Although...
18169,"Yuri: Ever since I was a kid, I've lived my life by one rule--that I'd only play my hand if I was guaranteed victory. I've gotten this far by using my cunning in any way necessary--lying, cheating, even killing when there was no other way... But this next play? Well, the odds don't exactly seem to be in my favor. Not unless you trust me enough to provide me with an ace... Heh. Never you mind, friend. Let's just go."
18170,Metodey: Ha ha ha! At last you've arrived! You certainly took your sweet time...
18171,Aelfric: My flock! Why have you come?!
18172,"Balthus: To save you of course. You didn't really think we'd just up and abandon you, did ya?"
18173,"Constance: If I may be so bold, we have the chalice you seek. Might I humbly request that you return Aelfric?"
18174,"Aelfric: You found the chalice? When I told you of it, I never imagined you'd--"
18175,Metodey: Let's make sure it's not some cheap imitation. Hand it over.
18176,Yuri: Not until you hand over the hostage. There needs to be some degree of a trusting exchange here.
18177,Metodey: I can see you don't understand your own predicament. We've no issue with killing the lot of you and taking it either way.
18178,Hapi: I can't tell if this guy's ears are stuffed with wool or if he's just this stupid.
18179,Yuri: Can't say I'm surprised. Thugs like this aren't about to show us any gesture of sincerity.
18180,Aelfric: Yuri! Stand down! Leave me! Take the chalice and flee--you must! It is irreplaceable--you must not hand it to these brigands!
18181,"Balthus: Heh. You know us better than that. We didn't come here without a plan. Do your thing, Hapi!"
18182,Metodey: Wait-- Do what thing?
18183,Hapi: Seriously? Right now?
18184,Metodey: Uh...
18185,"Balthus: Now, Hapi!"
18186,Hapi: Fine. Fine. Fine. *siiiiiiigh*
18187,Aelfric: Her sigh! She--
18188,Giant Bird: Crawwwwww!
18189,"Yuri: I've gotta say, that sigh of hers never gets old."
18190,"Hapi: Yeah, yeah, glad you like the show. It's not like it's a gift I asked for."
18191,Rogue: Gyah! Where did that thing come from?!
18192,"Yuri: Hahaha! Absolute cowards! How entertaining. Balthus, will you do the honors?"
18193,"Balthus: Leave it to me, Boss! I got--DAMN! Argh!"
18194,Giant Bird: Crawwwwww!
18195,"Yuri: Hey, Balthus, quit screwing around! Oh...wow. It flew off with him. He'll sort it out. At least we got Aelfric back in one piece. Now, to handle these fools."
18196,Metodey: Cheap party tricks! Let's make these children scream!
18197,"Aelfric: Your reckless actions could have been the death of you. Still, I thank you for saving me."
18198,Yuri: Don't go thanking me yet--we've still gotta get out of here.
18199,Metodey: Hmph. There's no time for foolish blunders when our future is at stake.
18200,Thief Leader: We must complete the mission the noble gave us. We shall vanquish these infidels posthaste.
18201,"Balthus: Didn't mind brawling a giant bird, but now I'm stuck here... Oh well. Time to show what happens when the Awe-Inspiring King of Grappling goes all out!"
18202,"Aelfric: I am deeply sorry that you got involved in this mess too. Please, just for now, lend me your aid. Let us all return home alive and well."
18203,"Yuri: Those cads are calling for backup. Ugh, when will this end?"
18204,Aelfric: Will it never end? But I cannot concede... There is important work I have yet to do...
18205,Aelfric: I didn't imagine it would end like this... I am so sorry...
18206,"Yuri: Ugh, there's still so many of them. Hapi, you know what to do."
18207,"Hapi: Again? What do you take me for, a sigh servant? *sigh* *siiiigh* *siiiiiiigh*"
18208,Giant Bird: Graaargh!
18209,Thief: Ugh! More monsters?
18210,"Metodey: Why are monsters like that in Garreg Mach?! Ah, well. Perhaps I can take the treasure they found as a parting gift."
18211,Metodey: Hm-hm-hm... Can it be? Princess Edelgard!
18212,Edelgard: Huh! How dare you disrespect House Hresvelg. This ends here!
18213,"Metodey: Just a few more moons, then all will know that I am the Empire's-- Hm-hm-hm... Forget I said anything. Then again, if you die, it won't matter either way!"
18214,"Metodey: I don't mind pain, but it's time to make my exit. My employer pays me more than this treasure is worth."
18215,"Balthus: You OK, Aelfric?"
18216,Aelfric: I am. All thanks to you. The Chalice--is it unharmed?
18217,"Hapi: Yes, it's safe. Chatterbox is--"
18218,Constance: What?!
18219,Yuri: Nighty night!
18220,Balthus: Yuri! You damned scoundrel! What are you doing?!
18221,"Yuri: Heh, I think you can see what I'm doing, Balthus."
18222,"Aelfric: Beautifully executed, Yuri. The chalice is finally mine now. Along with the blood of the Four Apostles."
18223,Constance: It seems I was correct...that there was an enemy in our midst. To think our bird was instead a rat.
18224,"Yuri: You've always had a wild imagination, Constance. I've got to say, turning your attention elsewhere was a challenge even for me."
18225,"Aelfric: That is enough with the banter, Yuri. I informed you not to divulge too much."
18226,"Yuri: They'll all be under the dirt soon enough. It's not like they'll be able to talk at that point. After all I've gone and done for you, Aelfric, I would think you'd have just a bit more faith in me."
18227,Aelfric: ...
18228,"Yuri: Your silence speaks volumes... Guess this is the end of the niceties. (turning to Byleth) It's all on you now, friend. I'm sure you and the others will figure it out."
18229,Dimitri: Professor! Are you injured?
18230,"Byleth:
Choice 1: I made it out unscathed.
Edelgard: Impossible. Surely you suffered a wound.
Choice 2: It's nothing too concerning...
Edelgard: I see you're well enough to make light of a serious situation. But surely you suffered a wound."
18231,"Choice 1: I made it out unscathed.
Edelgard: Impossible. Surely you suffered a wound."
18232,Edelgard: Impossible. Surely you suffered a wound.
18233,"Choice 2: It's nothing too concerning...
Edelgard: I see you're well enough to make light of a serious situation. But surely you suffered a wound."
18234,Edelgard: I see you're well enough to make light of a serious situation. But surely you suffered a wound.
18235,Byleth: I didn't.
18236,"Claude: Teach, there's no time for playing around. Tell us how-- Ah, I get it. He only pretended to attack you, didn't he? So you were just playing a part in this grand performance. But was that really the smartest decision here?"
18237,Dimitri: The chalice and the Ashen Wolves are gone. I am loath to think what will become of them without our help.
18238,Edelgard: And how do you propose we pursue them? We haven't a clue where they went.
18239,"Claude: Well, we know what they're after. That at least narrows down the possibilities."
18240,Rhea: Professor! Are we too late?
18241,Edelgard: Lady Rhea? Why have you come?
18242,"Rhea: After sending you all off, I began to investigate the lineage of the Ashen Wolves. In doing so, I was able to confirm that the documented information about their Crests was falsified. What was once a wild speculation, I now know to be true. The Crests they bear are the same as those of the Four Apostles--the very same who long ago enacted the Rite of Rising. Once the blood of the four is poured upon the chalice, its power can be harnessed. I believe we have enough evidence to assume that our Ashen Wolves will suffice to carry out this ritual."
18243,"Dimitri: So Aelfric's aim must be to carry out the Rite of Rising...at the expense of the students... Lady Rhea... What, precisely, is the purpose of this ritual?"
18244,"Claude: We've heard it has the power to resurrect life, but that can't be true... Can it?"
18245,"Rhea: The chalice is a holy artifact, created by the goddess herself. It serves to restore a physical form that was previously lost to this world."
18246,Claude: So those wild tales are true. It really can bring someone back to life.
18247,"Rhea: Not exactly. It can breath life into a body, but it cannot return a spirit that has already departed. Ultimately, it is a tool to return the goddess to her physical form. Her spirit is omnipresent, but her flesh is no more. Such incredible power is truly awe inspiring-- and extremely dangerous. In that way, it is akin to the Heroes' Relics. For this reason, the Four Apostles were never intended to pass down their Crests. This gathering should never have been possible. The Ashen Wolves are now gathered together, making it possible once more."
18248,"Claude: And Aelfric is at the center of this mess, luring them all to Abyss for his own selfish reasons. Without so much as a whisper of it to the church, of course."
18249,Rhea: This incident is my own doing. I never should have entrusted the chalice to them.
18250,"Edelgard: Lady Rhea, do you have any idea where they could have gone?"
18251,"Rhea: I do indeed. Garreg Mach, which is protected by the goddess, is the only place the Rite of Rising can be performed. Holding such a ritual requires absolute focus, so I imagine the setting would need to be serene, peaceful."
18252,Dimitri: There are countless such places within the monastery walls...
18253,"Byleth:
Choice 1: The Holy Mausoleum?
Edelgard: It's certainly peaceful there, but due to last month's incident, it's heavily guarded at the present.
Choice 2: The dining hall?
Dimitri: I hardly think the dining hall would be considered peaceful, Professor. Are you sure you're not just hungry?
Choice 3: The library?
Claude: I suppose it's quite there, but it's also open to the public and just a wee bit cramped, Teach."
18254,"Choice 1: The Holy Mausoleum?
Edelgard: It's certainly peaceful there, but due to last month's incident, it's heavily guarded at the present."
18255,"Edelgard: It's certainly peaceful there, but due to last month's incident, it's heavily guarded at the present."
18256,"Choice 2: The dining hall?
Dimitri: I hardly think the dining hall would be considered peaceful, Professor. Are you sure you're not just hungry?"
18257,"Dimitri: I hardly think the dining hall would be considered peaceful, Professor. Are you sure you're not just hungry?"
18258,"Choice 3: The library?
Claude: I suppose it's quite there, but it's also open to the public and just a wee bit cramped, Teach."
18259,"Claude: I suppose it's quite there, but it's also open to the public and just a wee bit cramped, Teach."
18260,"Rhea: For now, let us return to the monastery. There is much to consider."
18261,Alois: Lady Rhea!
18262,"Rhea: You look troubled, Alois. What has happened?"
18263,"Alois: Thieves have breached Garreg Mach's village walls! They've been pillaging the shops and residences, taking whatever they please!"
18264,Rhea: I wonder if this has anything to do with Aelfric.
18265,"Alois: There's no telling, but for now, their numbers are too great. They need the knights! By your will, Lady Rhea, allow us to clear the village of these hooligans!"
18266,"Rhea: Yes, Alois. Please ensure the safety of the villagers immediately. However, leave a few of your best knights here with me."
18267,"Alois: Yes, Your Grace. I'll see to it."
18268,Claude: Teach? You look like you've got something to say.
18269,Byleth: I do. It's about Yuri...
18270,"Claude: He told you to meet up with him at the Holy Mausoleum? You never run out of secrets, do ya, Teach?"
18271,"Dimitri: I'm certain that Yuri had his reasons for setting up this meeting. He took the time to speak with you, however cryptically, before he left."
18272,"Edelgard: Fair point, Dimitri. I do wonder why he told you it needed to be after midnight. Wouldn't it be better to rush to their aid immediately?"
18273,Claude: Yuri's no fool. There's a method to his madness...

18277,Hapi: Where the heck are we?
18278,"Yuri: Finally, you're all awake. Good morning, sleepyheads. Or is it a good evening?"
18279,"Constance: Yuri! You scoundrel! You are unfit to speak to us, liar that you are!"
18280,"Yuri: Yeah, yeah, liar, blah-blah. Nothing I haven't heard before."
18281,"Balthus: Look, pal, enough beating around the bush. What exactly are you trying to accomplish here? Where's Aelfric? And what the hell are you plotting?"
18282,"Yuri: Questions, questions. You're wearing me out, Balthus. Fine, then. I'll lay it out for you. Aelfric intends to reenact the Rite of Rising. He's preparing everything as we speak."
18283,"Hapi: What is this silly rite, anyway? He trying to do some crazy magic to raise the dead or something?"
18284,"Yuri: Actually, yes. By offering up the blood of the Four Apostles in the chalice, you can bring someone back to life. Saint Seiros performed the ritual 995 years ago, but not enough blood was given up. So the ritual was a bust. No clue what happened after that. That's what Aelfric concluded after scouring the records, anyway. And now, through extreme persistence, he's found and gathered the four of us, with our Crests. He placed us under his direct supervision within the Ashen Wolf House, and he did all of it to ensure a successful ritual--the Rite of Rising."
18285,Constance: You mean to say that he intends to drain our blood? To kill us?! Such an act would be unforgivable! An atrocity! I cannot die in this wretched hovel!
18286,"Hapi: Yeah, that sounds painful...and permanent. Count me out. Hang on--the number four includes you too, right? So you're gonna die too?"
18287,Yuri: Yep. That's the idea.
18288,"Balthus: And here I thought we were close, but all this time you've been skulking around, deceiving us. It hurts, Boss. Hurts bad. You wanna die, that it? Fine. I'll kill you myself. Just stop that crafty nonsense of yours and face me, fist to fist."
18289,"Yuri: Shut it. I've lived through hell and worse. After clawing my way here, you really think I want to die."
18290,Balthus: Then why throw your life away for the likes of Aelfric?
18291,Yuri: Some things are more important than my own life. Some things are worth protecting.
18292,Balthus: You're not making any damned sense!
18293,"Aelfric: It would seem that you want to be punished severely, Yuri."
18294,Yuri: That some sort of threat? There's not much you can do to me that hasn't already been done.
18295,"Aelfric: True. You took wing from the mud into which you were born and rose to such great heights. To break your spirit would take far too much effort. Though, if I must, I will kill your mother in adition to your dear people."
18296,Balthus: Oh... So that's it. You were trying to protect your mom.
18297,"Constance: Precisely what is it you are hoping to accomplish, Aelfric?"
18298,Aelfric: To resurrect someone I lost long ago--no matter the cost. Surely there are those for whom you'd do similar.
18299,"Constance: Perhaps... Even so, never would we annihilate those we care for!"
18300,"Aelfric: There's nothing I wouldn't do, nobody I wouldn't trade to see the light in her eyes once more..."
18301,"Balthus: Whoa... that lady looks real dead, pal."
18302,Aelfric: She is...for now.
18303,"Balthus: You're gonna regret this, Aelfric."
18304,"Aelfric: I accepted the regret I might feel from this long ago. As long as she returns, nothing else matters. Yuri, if you think you'll be pulling anything funny, think again. The Knights of Seiros won't save you. No doubt they're indisposed right now on some mission or other."
18305,"Yuri: Well, that's a damn shame. The whole evil villain look really doesn't suit someone as ""pious"" as you, Aelfric. Heh heh..."
18306,"Hapi: Yuri-bird, I could--"
18307,Yuri: Not yet.
18308,"Aelfric: It is time. Take them. Your blood will pour forth, filling the chalice."
18309,Yuri: You really are a fool...
18310,"Aelfric: You were diligent, Yuri. You kept me abreast of all the Ashen Wolves' movements. As recompense for being such a good student of my flock, I will gladly hear any final words from you."
18311,"Yuri: Heh, that's fresh. If you knew me at all, you'd know these won't be my final words. I'm simply biding my time."
18312,Aelfric: For what...
18313,Yuri: For the goddess's descent. Can you hear it? She's coming.
18314,Aelfric: Bells? This late at night?
18315,"Yuri: Yeah, you hear that, Aelfric? That's the sound of your demise. The knights are releasing my people as we speak. The ones you locked up and hid away."
18316,"Aelfric: How did you know about that-- Wait, the Knights of Seiros?!"
18317,"Yuri: Heh heh... Like I said, the evil villain look really doesn't suit you. I know it was you who sent me on that mission that ultimately lead to me landing in Abyss. Overall, your execution was lacking. Lady Rhea has been on to you as well. Oh, and just so you know, I've been working for her since before I ever began working for you. She had me keeping an eye on you. Told me to inform her if you seemed to be planning anything."
18318,Aelfric: You!
18319,"Yuri: But you took those I care most about hostage, which limited my options. You chained up the Wolves and kept a tight grip on my rogues in Abyss to ensure I wouldn't betray you. I struggled with whether or not to tell her everything. After all, my allies' lives were on the line. I deliberated on what to do next, knowing I'd have to rely on my own cunning to see this through. I waited for the chance I could rescue my mother and allies. All while paying lip service to you. Until today. The day you pulled all your forces in so you could attempt this ritual. You're no villain, with that sticky conscience you call a heart tripping you up. Not like me."
18320,Aelfric: ... I see. You were one step ahead of me all this time. It matters not. The ritual has begun. There's no stopping it now. You will all die. Just a bit longer.
18321,Yuri: Don't think for a moment--
18322,"Balthus: That you're getting off easy, pal!"
18323,"Balthus: Seriously, Boss. Did you have to tie us up so tightly?"
18324,"Yuri: Heh heh... Sorry, Balthus. I figured those little tears would be enough for you to break through the rope."
18325,"Balthus: I may be the Unbeatable King of Grappling, but I'm also bleeding profusely... You didn't wonder why it was taking me so long? Think next time, yeah?"
18326,"Constance: I haven't the slightest what you two are jabbering on about, but please untie our ropes as well."
18327,"Yuri: You're talking. Do it yourself. I dispelled the silence from you ages ago, or hadn't you noticed?"
18328,Constance: Oh! I see!
18329,"Hapi: It's great that we're not tied up anymore and all that, but we're still being actively drained..."
18330,"Aelfric: I've invested everything to ensure my success today. My private funds, a veritable army... Surround them! Don't let them escape! The ritual will not be stopped."
18331,"Constance: Ugh! Why won't it cease? We are freed, and yet our blood still drains from us?"
18332,"Yuri: Hmmm. Well, this wasn't part of the plan. Haha!"
18333,Constance: This is no laughing matter! Our very lives are ebbing away!
18334,"Yuri: Stop panicking, Constance. You know I'm never unprepared."
18335,"Balthus: Hey, you've always got a trick up your sleeve, don't ya? I can hear your secret plan running our way."
18336,"Hilda: Ugh. I don't know what's happening here, but it definitely doesn't look good."
18337,Dimitri: Can this really be the Rite of Rising... What precisely is going on?
18338,Linhardt: Their blood is being drained and then transformed into...raw power... Ugh... I... That's a lot of blood. Too much blood. This is hard to watch.
18339,"Constance: Could you step within the magical vortices beside us to obstruct their flow? Quickly, now! It is crucial to halting the Rite of Rising! The vortices are repelling the Crests of the Apostles! We can't block them ourselves!"
18340,"Yuri: Look, we really want to help, but right now, we just can't. Please do what you can!"
18341,"Aelfric: So this is how it feels. Infinite power flowing forth from the chalice... Without the chalice's protection, I doubt anyone will survive."
18342,"Hilda: So this will kill everyone, including your allies, and you don't even care?! We have to stop this now!"
18343,Constance: Well done! But you must stanch the flow from the other vortices too!
18344,Aelfric: No... No! Stop them!
18345,Aelfric: The ritual--it cannot fail!
18346,"Claude: Now that we've stopped the ritual, all that's left on the agenda is defeated Aelfric!"
18347,Aelfric: It matters not whose blood it is anymore. Even if I must use your blood to see this through. I will!
18348,"Aelfric: I have not wanted any harm to befall you, as you are her child. She'd have wanted you safe. But if you insist on getting in the way of this, I have no choice but to strike you down."
18349,"Aelfric: In the end, like all birds of prey, you'll turn on your master as easily as you'd turn on your victims."
18350,Yuri: Nothing and nobody can shackle me. A caged bird never sings.
18351,Balthus: I owe you a lot but not my life. Not an even trade in my book.
18352,"Aelfric: I feel some remorse over what I will require of you. But take it, I must. I will not shrink away from what is necessary."
18353,Balthus: That a fact? Then I guess a fight was inevitable.
18354,Aelfric: Ever the brutish thug.
18355,"Constance: The bill has come due for your misdeeds, Aelfric."
18356,Aelfric: It matters not. She is all that matters. She alone.
18357,"Constance: Ahaha! Then if words will not persuade you, let us proceed to actions!"
18358,"Aelfric: You're not as angry as I'd have expected, Hapi."
18359,Hapi: I guess I'm used to betrayals by now. But that doesn't mean I'm going to sit on my hands and let you hurt me and my friends.
18360,"Aelfric: Soon...soon, she will be brought back to me. Should anyone attempt to get between us, they will sorely regret it."
18361,Aelfric: Not yet... There's still time!
18362,"Aelfric: Professor. You would raise your sword against me? Your mother lies here, waiting for us. Waiting for you! Don't you want her back?"
18363,"Claude: Teach, is that true, or is he just trying to freak us out? If so...it's kind of working."
18364,"Byleth:
Choice 1: My mother died giving birth to me...
Choice 2: I don't have a mother.
Choice 3: You have no proof that's her."
18365,Choice 1: My mother died giving birth to me...
18366,Choice 2: I don't have a mother.
18367,Choice 3: You have no proof that's her.
18368,"Aelfric: There is no room for doubt. I know her appearance better than anyone. This...is her. An upstanding nun who married Jeralt, she died 21 long years ago..."
18369,Dimitri: You cannot expect us to believe that someone who died two decades ago is still in such pristine condition...
18370,"Aelfric: Incredible, isn't it? It's as though she remains untouched, even after all these years... Perhaps her body differs from others. Beautiful, ageless--perfectly preserved by some secret only she knows. Whatever the case may be, it is strange, is it not? It's been 10 long years since I found her. I came across her body, frozen in time, deep underground. I have worked tirelessly to solve the riddle of her death and bring her back to life."
18371,"Rhea: Halt, Aelfric."
18372,Aelfric: Rhea! You are the cause of this! It was you who killed her! When she gave birth to a child who made no sound. Tell me what you've done to her! Why does her body remain while her spirit does not?!
18373,"Rhea: I owe you no words on the matter. But I will tell you this... She made the choice to die, that her offspring might live. I respected her will. Nothing more. Aelfric. Just as I viewed her, so do I view you. You are as my own child. Please, cease this futility."
18374,"Aelfric: Oho! You expect that I should believe you without question?! You see her lying her before you, and yet you ""owe no words."" Rhea, I am finished with you. The only thing that remains to be done is to complete the ritual."
18375,Rhea: Hurry! He cannot have gone far.
18376,Byleth: Let's end this.
18377,"Edelgard: Yes, we must stop him at once. Let's figure out where he disappeared to."
18378,Dimitri: What about you four? You don't look like you're up for much of anything right now.
18379,"Yuri: It'll take a lot more than that to stop me. If anything, I feel speedier with less blood weighing me down."
18380,"Balthus: Probably for the best that he drained us, otherwise our blood would be boiling."
18381,"Constance: Ugh, speak for yourselves. I feel atrocious. We must end this, and swiftly."
18382,Hapi: Count me in.
18383,"Balthus: Then we're all on the same page. But first things first... Let me see that pretty face of yours, Boss."
18384,Yuri: Hm?
18385,Yuri: Agh!
18386,Balthus: Why the hell didn't you tell us?
18387,"Yuri: I'm sorry I had to use you all. But there wasn't much choice--someone would've died for sure otherwise. It could've been any of you. It could've been one of my rogues, someone from Abyss... Who knows."
18388,"Constance: You imply that you didn't trust us enough! I am incensed by you, Yuri."
18389,"Hapi: Use me or don't, but it would've been nice if you'd asked us first."
18390,"Balthus: Look, I get it. Your people were being held hostage. You were between a rock and a hard place. But I thought we were pals. Buddies till the end."
18391,Yuri: I... I need you...all of you. I've been a fool. Thank you for always being here for me. Even now.
18392,"Balthus: All right, I think this fool gets the picture. Time to find that other fool and take him down! (to Byleth) You'll help with that, yeah?"
18393,Byleth: Obviously.
18394,"Yuri: Haha! I love the lip on this one. Let's do this, Wolves."
18395,"Aelfric: To me, growing up inside the shelter of the monastery, she was my world... All of the memories I hold of her--learning, growing, walking hand in hand--she left me in awe."
18396,"Aelfric: If that's what makes her happy, then I will watch her walk away with warmth in my heart. If that is truly what will make her happy... Surely he will make her smile. That's all I wanted for her. To Sitri, confined within the monastery walls, he was her world. I saw the way her eyes glimmered when they spoke. And her otherworldly smile when they became engaged. The look on her face when she told me how happy she was to bear his child... It was enough for me to see her happiness--to witness it from a distance."
18397,"Aelfric: She breathed her last, 21 long years ago. I have never forgotten. She died before she could see the face of the child whom she had so lovingly nurtured... The funeral was a solemn affair. We gathered in the graveyard, said our farewells, and watched as her casket was lowered into the soil. That was the end of her story. Or so I thought. Until 10 years ago, when I found her--her remains, hidden deep within Abyss. She looked as beautiful as ever."

18402,"Rhea: Aelfric, cease this at once."
18403,"Aelfric: It is too late. The chalice is filled to its brim with the blood of the four. Should their blood prove insufficient, I will spill even my own blood to finish this."
18404,"Rhea: The chalice cannot return her soul, Aelfric. It is incapable even of returning the body to life."
18405,"Byleth: Please, you must stop."
18406,"Aelfric: Be not afraid. Today, your mother returns to us. The time has come. Perhaps I am not an equal man to him... But I am here by your side, Sitri. Sitri... Si...tri..."
18407,Edelgard: The chalice... It absorbed both of them!
18408,Dimitri: That aberration... What is it? An...umbral beast?
18409,Umbral Beast: Sitriii!
18410,Rhea: So I see... It is just as the last time the ritual was performed.
18411,Balthus: Is this really happening? Aelfric turned into... that thing?!
18412,Hapi: Ugh. It does seem like some kind of sick joke.
18413,"Yuri: So this is the Rite of Rising? Quite the dangerous ritual, if you ask me..."
18414,Knight of Seiros: Lady Rhea! Monsters have appeared at the cathedral!
18415,Rhea: Could it be? Perhaps his roar drew them there... Everyone who is capable must fight this beast--now.
18416,Yuri: Archbishop Rhea. Things ended up this way because of me. Please allow me to make up for it.
18417,Rhea: Yuri...
18418,Yuri: It'll give me a chance to hold up my end of the deal. Let me fight for the church.
18419,"Constance: Ahaha! So very like you to steal the glory in the heat of the moment. Aelfric used us--he lied to us--and attempted to slay us. Despite that, he provided shelter when I had none. We must end things swiftly, for his sake."
18420,"Hapi: He's never going to be normal again, is he? For all those years, he tried to make this happen--bring her back--only to lose himself. That's pretty awful."
18421,"Balthus: He made his choice. All we can do is accept it. Let's do all of us a favor and take him out real quick-like, yeah?"
18422,"Claude: We'll help too. Together we stand, together we fall."
18423,"Dimitri: Yes, you can rely on us until the very end."
18424,Edelgard: Time to lower the curtain on this unfortunate tale.
18425,Byleth: Let's do this.
18426,"Rhea: Please, act swiftly but with great care. By my order, stop the umbral beast--stop Aelfric!"
18427,Constance: This magnificent cathedral will collapse if this continues for much longer!
18428,Yuri: That abomination sure as hell isn't going to back down. We've got no choice but to go all in.
18429,Umbral Beast: Grrr! Graaaargh!
18430,Balthus: He's isolated! Let's surround him. Close the distance in one fell swoop.
18431,Claude: Don't be rash. Conventional rules don't apply in a battle like this.
18432,Dimitri: He's right. We have no way of knowing what that beast is capable of. We must proceed with caution.
18433,Linhardt: An illusion...and it looks just like Aelfric.
18434,Hapi: I'm not sure I can fight him...even if it's not really him.
18435,"Hilda: Don't worry, Hapi. I can!"
18436,Ashe: The beast can...feed off these illusions somehow?!
18437,Edelgard: Its wounds are healing. How troublesome...
18438,"Yuri: You can't hear me now. Not like this. Not anymore. You really are a damn fool, you know that?"
18439,"Balthus: I intended to take one for the team, but damn. This thing is way uglier than I thought. Heh, perfect. This will be one for the history books."
18440,"Hapi: Elfie's gone now, transformed into that...thing. Sometimes the world's too horrible to wrap my head around."
18441,"Constance: This is what comes of meddling with a sacred tool commissioned by the progenitor god. But clearly it's too late to scold you at this point. For now, we must focus on dealing with the result."
18442,Hapi: What the heck was that? We all got moved to different positions.
18443,Constance: It's some brand of spatial-distortion magic. I haven't the faintest how to defend against it!
18444,Balthus: Damn! Don't let that thing catch you alone. It's too risky.
18445,"Yuri: Yeah, don't be reckless. Stand united."
18446,"Rhea: It is finished. Well done, everyone. Because of you, her restless soul has finally found peace. Professor... I imagine you have much on your mind."
18447,Byleth: My mother...
18448,"Rhea: I was there the day she brought you fourth into this world. Sitri had always been frail. Giving birth proved to be too much for her in the end... On that fated day, it looked as though neither of you would survive. In those final moments, she spoke, saying, ""My heart... Give it to my child."""
18449,"Byleth:
Choice 1: From the beginning, my heart wouldn't beat?
Choice 2: My mother's heart gave me life?"
18450,"Choice 1: From the beginning, my heart wouldn't beat?"
18451,Choice 2: My mother's heart gave me life?
18452,"Rhea: That is correct. The heart that lies within your chest is none other than hers. It was the only way that you could be saved. But Sitri loved others, much as a human might--and I loved her in return."
18453,Byleth: But why wasn't she buried?
18454,"Rhea: Sitri looked upon me as though I was her mother, and I wished for her to have a bright future... I would not have her buried in the cold, dark soil. Prior to her funeral, I arranged for a fake burial. Afterward, I brought her body to Abyss, where I would sometimes visit her. I never thought that anyone--especially Aelfric--would find her. I did not expect for such a tragedy to ensue..."
18455,"Balthus: Boss, there's something you gotta tell me. Was Aelfric really just using us all that time?"
18456,"Yuri: How should I know? I mean, he always acted that way around me--like we were a means to an end. But the church records indicate he founded the Ashen Wolf House 15 years ago. He mentioned he found Sitri 10 years ago, so it seems he really did mean well, at first..."
18457,"Hapi: What's done is done. He's gone, and we're here. That's what matters now."
18458,"Constance: You're always so quick to adapt to change, Hapi. I should follow your example."
18459,"Yuri: Heh, yeah, you always get to the heart of things quickly. Right, then. I've got a lot to take care of now. I need to fill the church in on all the details about how things actually played out. And with my people freed from the monastery prison, they'll need to be accounted for."
18460,Hapi: Good luck with that whole mess. I'll be rooting for you from afar.
18461,Constance: Surely you'll let us know if there is any way at all we can help. We'd be just thrilled.
18462,"Balthus: Hell, if you want, your people can be my people. I could use some good mercenaries to watch my back."
18463,Yuri: Enough already. I get it.
18464,Hapi: It's no less than you deserve.
18465,"Constance: What you have sown, now you shall reap!"
18466,"Balthus: You made your bed, now shut up about it, pal."
18467,"Hapi: Heh... Anyway, what do you figure will happen to Abyss? The church will want to step in, no doubt."
18468,"Yuri: You got me. After everything that's happened, thing's can't stay the same. The church will probably assign an official to oversee things. Hopefully whoever they choose knows how to get along with Abyssians well."
18469,"Balthus: Let's worry about all that some other time, yeah? I could really use a tall drink and a long sleep."
18470,Hapi: I'm with you. I hurt in places I didn't even know could hurt.
18471,"Constance: It has been a terribly long night, indeed. One I won't ever forget."
18472,"Yuri: A terribly long night, but a beautiful morning, haha."
18473,Constance: You mean to say that you are disbanding us?
18474,"Rhea: Yes. After speaking with the cardinals, my decision is final. The Ashen Wolf House was originally established for youths who were in need of the church's protection. Somewhere along the way, that intent was corrupted, and it ultimately became a cage for you. The Ashen Wolves are officially disbanded. You can consider this a graduation, of sorts."
18475,"Hapi: You can doll this up by calling it graduating, but you're the one who sent me to Abyss to begin with. Now you waltz in here and tell us to just go live our lives, as if none of this ever happened?"
18476,"Rhea: You may continue living in Abyss, of course. Abyss will always be a refuge for those who need it most. Your chains have been unbound. You are free to live as you wish now."
18477,"Balthus: You ask me, this feels like good timing. This sound pretty all right, Rhea."
18478,"Constance: After all I have been through, I must say I feel immense gratitude at the prospect of living freely."
18479,"Yuri: You're just going to let me go? While I was working with the church, I still did some unsavory things..."
18480,"Rhea: You have already been judged for your transgressions, Yuri. You have slain the undeserving. The weight of that is yours to bear. You have time to contemplate your actions now. That is punishment enough."
18481,Yuri: ...
18482,"Balthus: What's with the ""woe is me"" act? She's saying you're a free man!"
18483,Yuri: True enough. It's up to me to determine how I'll live my life now...how I'll make up for what I've done.
18484,"Edelgard: You made up your mind quickly, despite having ample time to think it through."
18485,"Constance: Ahaha! Someone of my many talents must make decisions in short order--I'm in high demand, after all. The Fhirdiad Royal School of Sorcery demands my presence posthaste. How could I deny them? Soon, the name Nuvelle shall be renowned all throughout the Imperial capital--prepare yourselves!"
18486,"Linhardt: Didn't you already attend that school? Leaving and going back seems... Eh, well, good luck with that."
18487,"Hapi: Maybe I'll try to see my family again. It's been forever, but now seems like as good a time as any to do that. The whole thing might be a drag, though, so maybe I'll come straight back to Abyss."
18488,"Balthus: I think I'll... Yeah, yep! I'll find a way to hit it big--make tons of money! It's about time the Indebted King of Grappling finally paid down all those damn debts."
18489,"Hilda: You could always ask my brother to help you out. Seems like a good way to go, really."
18490,"Balthus: Borrow from Holst? That's a hard no! Wouldn't dare to trouble my best pal like that. That's enough about me. What are you going to do now, Boss?"
18491,"Yuri: Eh, who knows. For now I'll take some time to think. My main concern at this point is taking care of my people back in my hometown."
18492,Ashe: You mean you'll continue your former line of work?
18493,"Yuri: No need to beat around the bush. And yeah, that's the plan. It's what I'm best at. But I can approach things differently now. Change how I live--find ways to thrive in peace, you know?"
18494,Ashe: Makes sense to me. I wish you all the best.
18495,"Yuri: Thanks, friend. Right back at you. We both deserve to live our lives freely. I may end up back home after all this, but I worry about how my rogues here would fare without a boss."
18496,"Balthus: Always worrying about everyone but yourself. Stop with that already, yeah?"
18497,"Byleth:
Choice 1: Yeah, you don't need to be concerned.
Choice 2: I'll look after Abyss."
18498,"Choice 1: Yeah, you don't need to be concerned."
18499,Choice 2: I'll look after Abyss.
18500,"Yuri: There you go being cute again. Though I'm certain if you're around, Abyss and everyone in it will be just fine."
18501,"Edelgard: We'll keep an eye on Abyss, as well. Isn't that right, you two?"
18502,Claude: Absolutely. That place is a treasure trove of secrets. Just try to keep me away.
18503,"Dimitri: I trust your motives are not all so selfish, Claude. And yes, we promise to protect Abyss in your absence."
18504,Rogue: Boss! Boss! You can't just leave us high and dry like this! Where will we go? What will we do?
18505,Yuri: I should've known... Humans are adaptable creatures. You'll sort it out just fine.
18506,"Balthus: Heh, relax, will ya? We all know Yuri's not the type to abandon his pals. He's a guy who always turns up when he's needed. Hell, we should all be taking notes from him."
18507,Hapi: The world's a dreary place. We could all use a little help now and again.
18508,"Yuri: As long as we're all here for each other as true friends, we can live our lives to the fullest."
18509,Byleth: Friends...
18510,Yuri: You heard me. You're all my friends... You matter. You always will.
18511,Hapi: That seems like a good note to end on.
18512,"Balthus: Sure does. Catch ya later, pals. I mean...friends."
18513,"Constance: With that, I bid you farewell! Hehe!"
18514,"Yuri: And so it is. Until next time, friend."
