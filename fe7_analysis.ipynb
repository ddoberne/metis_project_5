I found you unconscious on the plains. I am Lyn, of the\\n   Lorca tribe. You\\'re safe now. Who are you? Can you remember your name?\\n   Your name is Agung? What an odd-sounding name... But pay me no mind. It is\\n   a good name. I see by your attire that you are a traveler.\\n   What brings you to the Sacae Plains? Would you share your story with me?\\n   Hm? What was that noise? I\\'ll go see what\\'s happening. Agung, wait here\\n   for me.\\n\\nLyn  : Oh, no! Bandits! They must have come down from the Bern Mountains!\\n   They must be planning on raiding the local villages. I... I have to stop\\n   them! If that\\'s all of them, I think I can handle them on my own. You\\'ll\\n   be safe in here, Agung! What? You want to help? Well, can you use a\\n   weapon? Ah, I see... So you\\'re a strategist by trade? An odd profession,\\n   but... Very well. We\\'ll go together!\\n\\nLyn  : Over here! If you want to help, Agung, I could use your advice. I\\'ll\\n   protect you, so stay close to me.\\n\\nUnit Information :\\nLyn is the blue unit. The enemy units are red. Agung, you are green.\\nEssentially, battle consists of blue (allied) units and red (enemy) units\\ntaking turns moving on the field. You\\'re only here as a strategist, Agung.\\nYou will only appear during special events. Your job as strategist is to\\nplace the cursor on blue units to issue their orders.\\nFirst, select a unit. Place the cursor on Lyn and press the A Button.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLyn  : I need to be closer to the enemy.\\nLyn  : Yes, this should be close enough.\\nLyn  : Uh-oh! That bandit\\'s spotted me! He\\'s coming this way! Let\\'s close in\\n   and attack!\\n\\nYou have selected Lyn. When a unit is selected, the map changes color like\\nso. Lyn can move anywhere in the blue area. Move her to the space with the\\nflashing cursor. Place your cursor there, and then press the A Button to\\nfinish.\\nSelect Lyn. Move to one of the areas adjacent to the bandit.\\n\\nLyn  : I have to be right next to him to attack!\\n\\nNow, strike. Select attack!\\n\\nLyn  : Victory! But I\\'ve been injured. I have need of a vulnerary.\\nLyn  : There\\'s another bandit over by the ger to the west. You don\\'t know what\\n   a ger is? It\\'s a type of round hut. Many nomads live in huts like these.\\nLyn  : Hmm... I would do well to use this time to administer a little first\\n   aid.\\n\\nMove to the space marked by the flashing cursor.\\nOpen the Item menu and select a vulnerary. Next, choose Use.\\n\\nLyn  : I\\'m carrying a couple of vulneraries in my satchel. They should heal me\\n   up. Would you get one for me?\\nLyn  : Thank you, Agung! Now, let\\'s go get that brigand over by the ger!\\n\\nBatta : Who do you think you are?\\tYou think you can stand up to Batta\\n   the Beast?\\n\\nLyn  : Whew! He\\'s tough... It all comes down to this next blow! Agung, if I\\n   fall, I want you to flee. You must escape!\\n\\nBatta : What? Howâ€¦ How did you--\\n\\nLyn  : Whew... That was close. I sorely underestimated him. Sorry if I\\n   worried you. I\\'ll need to be stronger if I\\'m going to survive... Strong\\n   enough that no one can defeat me.\\n\\nLyn gain experience in each encounter. When she has enough experience, she\\nwill level up. As she increases in level, her abilities improve. Over time,\\nshe will grow much stronger.\\nIt\\'s time to bring this chapter to a close. Select Lyn and move her to the\\ngate where Batta the Beast was standing. Select Seize to complete Lyn\\'s\\nvictory and your own!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : Good morning, Agung! Are you awake yet? That fight yesterday must have\\n   taken a lot out of you. Say, Agung... I want to talk to you about\\n   something. You have some experience in the ways of war, I can see. Would\\n   you allow me to travel with you?\\nLyn  : What? You want me to get permission from my parents? My mother and my\\n   father... died six months ago. My people --- the Lorca--- they don\\'t...\\n   I\\'m the last of my tribe. Bandits attacked, and... they killed so many\\n   people. The tribe was scattered. My father was our chieftain, and I\\n   wanted to protect our people. I am so young, and my parent are old-\\n   fashioned. They wouldn\\'t follow a woman. No one would follow me.\\nLyn  : Sniff... I\\'m sorry. I\\'ve been alone for so long... No. No more. I will\\n   shed no more tears. Thank you. I\\'m better now.\\nLyn  : Agung, I want-- I must become stronger, so that I may avenge my\\n   father\\'s death! Yesterday\\'s battle taught me something. I won\\'t become\\n   stronger by sitting here alone. Agung, tell me you\\'ll train me, that\\n   you\\'ll let me travel with you! You will? That\\'s wonderful! Thank you! Oh,\\n   thank you! We\\'ll be better off working together, I know it. You\\'ll be my\\n   master strategist, and I\\'ll be your peerless warrior! We can do it! Right?\\n\\nTravel with Lyn, Agung. Give her your aid, and master the art of combat.\\nComplete the tasks set out in each chapter, and help Lyn in her quest.\\nTurn the instruction windows on or off by pressing SELECT.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.1  CHAPTER ONE : FOOTSTEPS OF FATE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe apprentice tactician Agung and the young swordfighter Lyn. A strange pair\\non an even stranger journey. To prepare for the long road ahead, they go to\\nBulgar, the commercial center of Sacae. Unbeknownst to Lyn, she will discover\\nsomething that will alter her life forever.\\n\\nLyn  : Agung! Over here! This is Bulgar, the biggest city in all of Sacae.\\n   We should purchase supplies for our journey. Oh, my heart! What a dazzling\\n   vision of loveliness! Hm?\\nSain : Wait, O beauteous one! Would you not favor me with your name? Or\\n   better yet, your company?\\nLyn  : Where are you from, sir knight, that you speak so freely to a stranger?\\nSain : Ha! I thought you\\'d never ask! I am from Lycia. I hail from the\\n   Caelin canton, home to men of passion of fire!\\nLyn  : Shouldn\\'t that be \"home to callow oafs with loose tongues\"?\\nSain : Ooooh... You\\'re even lovely when you\\'re cruel.\\nLyn  : Let\\'s go, Agung. I\\'ve nothing more to say.\\nSain : Wait! Please...\\nKent : Sain! Hold you tongue!\\nSain : Ah, Kent! My boon companion! Why so severe an expression?\\nKent : If your manner were more serious, I wouldn\\'t have to be so severe!\\n   We still have a mission to complete, Sain!\\nSain : I know that. But how could I remain silent in the presence of such\\n   beauty? It would have been discourteous!\\nKent : What do you know of courtesy!?\\nLyn  : Excuse me! You\\'re blocking the road. If you would be so kind as to move\\n   your horses...\\nKent : Of course. My apologies...\\nLyn  : Thank you . You, at least, seem honorable enough.\\nKent : Hm? Pardon me, but... I feel we\\'ve met before.\\nLyn  : I beg your pardon?\\nSain : Hey! No fair, Kent! I saw her first!\\nLyn  : Tsk! It seems there are no decent men among Lycia\\'s knights! Let\\'s go,\\n   Agung! I\\'ve run out of patience!\\nKent : Wait, please! It\\'s not like that. Sain, you lout!\\nSain : Huh? Not like that? I thought you were...\\nKent : I am NOT you!!! Come, we must follow her. I suspect she might be--\\nSain : Be what? She\\'s our mission? You\\'re joking! Wait!\\n\\nLyn  : Run!!! We\\'re being pursued! Could it be those knights from town?\\n   No... It\\'s not them. These men are out for blood!\\nZugu : Heh heh hehhh... Aren\\'t you the pretty one! Your name is Lyndis, is\\n   it not?\\nLyn  : What did you call me?... Who are you?\\nZugu : Such a waste. An absolute waste. The things I\\'ll do for gold. Ah,\\n   well. Time to die, darlin\\'! C\\'mon out, boys!\\nLyn  : Oh, no! There are more than I can handle... But I\\'ll not give up!\\nSain : Hey! There she is!\\nLyn  : Huh?\\nLyn  : What?\\nSain : Whew... Finally caught up... Hold! You there! what is your business?\\n   Such numbers agains a girl? Cowards, every one of you!\\nLyn  : You! You\\'re from--\\nKent : We can discusss that later. It appears these ruffians mean to do you\\n   harm. If it\\'s a fight they want, let them look to me! Stand back! I\\'ll take\\n   care of this!\\nLyn  : No! This is my fight! Stay out of my way!\\nSain : Well, I can\\'t just stand here and do nothing...\\nKent : I have a solution. You there, command us. I am Kent, a knight of Lycia.\\n   My companion is Sain. We will follow your orders in this battle. Is this\\n   acceptable, milady?\\nLyn  : Yes, it is. Agung and I will lead! Let\\'s go!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSain : You! You are called Agung? I want to impress my beauteous one! Let me\\n   attack first!\\n\\nBlue units are allies. Direct them on the field as you did with Lyn before.\\nBe warned: If Lyn is defeated, your journey is over, as is your game.\\nIf other blue units are beaten, the game will continue, but fallen companions\\nwill be unable to return to battle for the rest of the tutorial. Use caution\\nand good judgment. After all blue units have been moved, it automatically\\nbecomes the enemy\\'s turn.\\nTo begin with, select Sain. Place the cursor on Sain, and press the A button.\\n\\n\\nSain : Attack! Move me to a space next to my foe!\\nSain : Whoa! I missed!?\\nKent : Sain! Why aren\\'t you using your sword?\\nSain : The lance is more heroic. A knight should look heroic, don\\'t you think?\\nKent : You\\'re hopeless. If you don\\'t take fighting more seriously, you\\'re\\n   going to find yourself on the end of a blade!\\nSain : Truth be told, I...forgot to buy a sword.\\nKent : Forgot? Or were you simply too busy dallying with the ladies?\\nSain : Don\\'t be so mad! I\\'ll be fine with a lance. I\\'m that good!\\nKent : I\\'d prefer to rely on your skill, not your empty bragging! Take my\\n   spare blade and use it to attack next time!\\nSain : Are you sure? My thanks, Kent!\\nKent : You\\'re almost more trouble than you\\'re worth. Almost.\\n\\nSain got an Iron Sword.\\n\\nKent : Agung! Allow me to make up for my companion\\'s blunder. I am at your\\n   command!\\n\\nWeapons possess a unique hierarchy.\\nSwords best axes. Axes best lances. Lances best swords.\\nThis is called the weapon triangle. Remembering this is of the utmost\\nimportance.\\nFirst, let\\'s illustrate that swords are strong against axes.\\nSelect Kent.\\n\\nKent : The enemy wields an axe. Use a sword for my attack! He\\'s almost\\n   defeated. Now, let\\'s deliver the final blow!\\nLyn : I must be next to the enemy!\\n\\nSain : Agung! Give me another chance! I failed you once before, but give me\\n   another chance... I\\'ll not fail you again! Axe-wielding foes should be met\\n   with swords. Brandish your blade! Gah!\\nKent : Sain! Are you all right?\\nSain : Yes. Yes, I am. I was able to dodge in time. I can\\'t believe he evaded\\n   my sword stroke so easily. This is no jest.\\nKent : Look closely. The enemy is hidden in the woods. The branches make it\\n   difficult to attack, don\\'t they?\\nSain : You\\'re right. I was so focused on attacking... I didn\\'t see.\\nKent : Your lack of attention may someday cost you your life!\\nSain : Fine! I understand already! Let it go, Kent!\\nKent : If you truly understand, then act like it!\\nSain : Kent worries too much. He\\'s going to grow old before his time.\\n\\nEach type of terrain has unique characteristics. For example, look at woods\\nand plains. Battle an enemy from the woods, and the enemy will likely miss\\nyou. However, your attacks will be unimpeded, giving you a distinct advantage.\\nThe same is true for foes. If an enemy is in the woods, he is more difficult\\nto hit. Factoring in your terrain benefits and the weapon triangle is vital\\nin combat.\\nThe windows at the bottom of the screen gives information on the terrain the\\ncursor is placed on.\\nCheck to see what terrain type is advantegous by using the cursor.\\nNow, let\\'s put this to the test. Select Kent.\\n\\nKent : I\\'m ready for battle. Command me as you will! Let\\'s use my sword to\\n   attack!\\n\\nLyn : It seems like a wise decision to leave that bandit to the knights. For\\n   my part, if I\\'m going to take care of the other foe, I\\'ll need to close\\n   the distance between us. The knight said that the woods are advantageous,\\n   right? In that case... That looks good. Let\\'s move there, Agung!\\n\\nLyn  : You... Your name is Sain, right?\\nSain : Yes! Sain, the gallant man of Caelin. That\\'s me!\\nLyn  : If you insist... Why have you not healed yourself?\\nSain : Huh? Hey! I\\'ve been injured? What a cad I am! To wrinkle that perfect\\n   brow of yours with worry for me...\\nLyn  : Uh... I was thinking of giving you a vulnerary, but... It looks like\\n   you\\'re fine. So, never you mind.\\nSain : No, wait! I\\'ll take it! Please! I\\'ll take it!!\\n\\nTo give away an item, use the trade command. Trade can only be used by units\\nthat are adjacent to one another. Let\\'s use the trade command now. Select Sain\\nand move him next to Lyn.\\n\\nSain : I can\\'t keep such a generous offer waiting! The healing power of love\\n   awaits with yon angel! Agung! Tarry no longer!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNow select the trade command. Sain\\'s and Lyn\\'s possessions will be displayed\\ntogether. Use the cursor to select a vulnerary from Lyn\\'s items, and give it\\nto Sain. After you\\'ve finished your trade, press the B Button to end the\\nprocess. The B Button is the cancel button. It can be used to rescind\\nmistaken commands and other things.\\nPlace the cursor on Lyn\\'s items. Press right on the + Control Pad. Press up\\nor down on the + Control Pad, and select a vulnerary. Then, press the A\\nButton. Press the A button to accept the vulnerary from Lyn. Press the B\\nButton to stop trading.\\nSain can now use Lyn\\'s vulnerary. Select the vulnerary from the items and use\\nit. Furthermore, mounted units have the unique ability to move again.\\nEssentially, this allows cavalry to move the number of spaces left in their\\nmovement range if they haven\\'t done so already. However, the attack command,\\namong others, nullifies the move again ability, so be careful.\\nSelect Sain and order him to move again.\\n\\nSain : Ah, much better! Thanks, Agung! And you have my gratitude as well,\\n   my angel!\\nLyn  : ...\\n\\nMission goal change from chapter to chapter. This chapter\\'s goal is to defeat\\nall enemies. Check the chapter goals in the window to the upper right of the\\nscreen. To open the map menu, place the cursor on an unoccupied space and\\npress the A Button.\\nYou can confirm the chapter goals here by choosing \"Status\" from the menu. The\\nmap menu also has the \"Suspend\" command. This is useful if you need to stop a\\nchapter midway. Time to continue this chapter! Best of luck!\\n\\nZugu : Accursed knights. Alway tampering in other\\'s affairs.\\n\\nZugu : Blast... There was only... supposed to be a lone... girl..\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : That\\'s the last of them! Fantastic work, Agung! And now for these\\n   knights of Lycia. You were going to share your story with me?\\nKent : Yes. We have ventured from Caelin, in Lycia, in search of someone.\\nLyn  : Lycia... That is the country beyond the mountains in the southwest,\\n   isn\\'t it?\\nKent : Correct. We\\'ve come as messengers to the lady Madelyn, who eloped with\\n   a nomad some 19 years ago.\\nLyn  : Madelyn?\\nKent : Our lord the marquess of Caelin\\'s only daughter. He was heartbroken\\n   his own daughter would abandon him so. Eventually, the marquess simply\\n   declared that he had no daughter.\\nSain : And then this year, we received a letter from Lady Madelyn. It said\\n   that she, her husband, and their daughter were living happily on the\\n   Sacae plains. The marquess was ecstatic to learn he had a granddaughter\\n   of 18 years. I remember the smile on his face when he announced that he\\'d\\n   suddenly become a grandfather. The granddaughter\\'s name is Lyndis. This\\n   was also the name of the marquess\\'s wife, who passed away at an early age.\\nLyn  : Lyndis?\\nSain : That she should bear this name thawed the marquess\\'s heart. Now, his\\n   only wish is to meet his daughter\\'s family at least once. This is why\\n   we\\'re here. We didn\\'t know that Lady Madelyn died a few days after sending\\n   her letter... We only learned this shortly after we arrived here in Bulgar.\\n   But we also learned all was not lost. Her daughter yet lives. We heard that\\n   she was living alone on the plains.\\nKent : I... I knew it immediately. You are the lady Lyndis.\\nLyn  : Why would you think that...\\nKent : Your resemblance to your departed mother is remarkable.\\nLyn  : What? Did you know my mother?\\nKent : I\\'m sorry to say I never met her directly, but I saw her portraits in\\n   Castle Caelin.\\nLyn  : To the rest of my tribe, I was always Lyn. But when I was with my\\n   parents... When it was just the three of us, I was Lyndis. It\\'s all so\\n   strange. I was all alone in the world, and now I have a grandfather.\\n   Lyndis... I never thought I would hear that name again.\\nKent : ...\\nLyn  : Wait. That bandit! He called me Lyndis, too!\\nKent : What? How could he have--\\nSain : He was a henchman of Lord Lundgren, wasn\\'t he?\\nLyn  : Lundgren? Who\\'s that?\\nKent : He\\'s the marquess\\'s younger brother. Everyone assumed the lady Madelyn\\n   was gone forever. This made Lord Lundgren heir to the marquess\\'s title.\\nSain : To be blunt, milady. Your existence is an obstacle to your granduncle\\'s\\n   ambitions.\\nLyn  : That\\'s-- But I have no interest in inheriting any title!\\nSain : Unfortunately, your granduncle is not the sort of man to believe that.\\n   I believe the attempts on your life will persist.\\nLyn  : What should I do?\\nKent : Accompany us to Caelin. Continuing on this way is dangerous.\\nLyn  : I feel I have little choice. I will go with you.\\n\\nLyn  : Agung... I\\'m sorry. This changes everything. What will you do, Agung?\\n   You... want me to decide? Of course, your companionship would do much to\\n   ease my journey, but... It\\'s going to be so dangerous. You\\'ll come? Are you\\n   sure? Thank you! Let me ask once again for your friendship and your aid.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.2  CHAPTER TWO : SWORD OF SPIRITS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nA small altar lies on the outskirts of Bulgar. This ancient temple, sacred to\\nthe people of Sacae, has long been know for its powerful bond to the world of\\nspirits. Before starting their journey, our travelers come here to pray for\\ntheir well-being. At this altar, Lyn\\'s hand is directed to a grand\\nintheritance.\\n\\nLyn  : Agung, hold a moment, and allow me a short detour. There is a sacred\\n   sword enshrined in an altar east of here. The people of Sacae go there to\\n   pray for safety at the onset of a long journey.\\nSain : Oh! How quaint!\\nKent : The teachings of Elimine have the most followers in Elibe. It is nice\\n   to see that, here at least, the ancient customs are still observed.\\n\\nGlass : Old man! Stay where you are, and hold your tongue!\\nPriest : Threaten me as you will, but I\\'ll not give up the Mani Katti. The\\n   Mani Katti is a sacred blade, under divine protection. It cannot be removed\\n   from it\\'s place of rest!\\nGlass : You\\'re a fool, old man. What good is a sword, if you can not use it?\\nPriest : Use it? In combat? Sacrilege!\\nGlass : Sacrilege? I am Glass! The gods fear my name! My swordplay is\\n   peerless! And if I want this sword, then this sword I shall have! Now, get\\n   out of my way!\\nPriest : Oof!\\nGlass : This is it! It\\'s more magnificent than I\\'d imagined! This sword was\\n   made for a swordsman of my skill. Hmm? What\\'s this? I can\\'t... draw the\\n   sword... from it\\'s scabbard?\\nPriest : The spirits of the blade have judged you. You have been found\\n   wanting. They have rejected you.\\nGlass : What? Listen, you senile old fool, if you value your own life, you\\'ll\\n   get out of my sight!!! Curses! Miserable spirits! I care nothing for you!\\n   I\\'ll tear this altar down stone by stone!\\n\\nNPC  : I beg your pardon,milady. Are you headed east? To the altar?\\nLyn  : Yes, we are indeed.\\nNPC  : Then you must hurry and help the priest there. I saw a band of ruffian\\n   head in there not long ago. They seemed intent on stealing the altar\\'s\\n   sacred sword!\\nLyn  : The Mani Katti... They\\'re going to steal it? I cannot allow this to\\n   happen!\\nNPC  : You look like a virtuous group. Please, help him!\\nSain : Lyndis, what are you planning?\\nKent : If you hope to go to the priest\\'s aid, you\\'ll need to prepare.\\nLyn  : You\\'re right... Say, Agung... There are some homes to the south of us.\\n   Perhaps we should go there and question the residents.\\n\\nThe three buildings to the south are homes. You can speak with the people who\\nlive there. They sometimes give you combat hints or useful information about\\nthe land and the people. It pays to listen!\\nLyn  : Shall I take the lead? All right. Tell me what you would like me to do,\\n   Agung.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : You want me to visit that home, right? I understand.\\n\\nHouse ()\\nNPC  : Say, aren\\'t you the... Oh! You\\'re going to help the priest! Well,\\n   perhaps you could benefit from something I saw earlier... The bandits may\\n   have the main entrance guarded. However, one of the altar\\'s walls is\\n   cracked and in poor repair. You might be able to create another entrance by\\n   hitting that section with your weapons. We\\'re all counting on you!\\n\\n\\nNext, send Sain to visit another home. Start by selecting Sain.\\n\\nSain : I\\'m next, am I? Well, I\\'m ready to go!\\n\\nHouse ()\\nNPC  : Mountains make it more difficult to be hit, but they\\'re difficult to\\n   traverse. If you\\'re riding on horseback, you can\\'t cross them at all. Be\\n   careful.\\n\\nRemember, your mounted units possess the ability to move again. After moving,\\ncavalry can move the rest of their movement range, unless they\\'ve received\\nattack or staff commands. This also goes for units mounted on pegasi and\\nwyverns. Now, give Sain his command.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s send Kent to visit the remaining home. This visit isn\\'t\\nnecessary for combat purposes. However, it\\'s residents may have useful\\nknowledge. I recommend stopping by. Select Kent.\\n\\nKent : I\\'m next to move, am I not? I await your command.\\n\\nHouse ()\\nNPC  : Do you know much about the sword held at the altar? It\\'s called the\\n   Mani Katti, blessed by the spirits. According to the priest,the Mani Katti\\n   is waiting for its rightful owner to appear. It\\'s so odd, don\\'t you think?\\n   The idea that a sword can choose who will wield it?\\n\\nYou should know something about fortresses. Fortresses offer more protection\\nthan woods do. Fighting from a space in a fortress is beneficial. Remember,\\nthis holds true for friend and foe alike. Keep this in mind before engaging\\nyour enemy.\\nFortresses also allow injured units to regain hit points. Your units\\nautomatically regain some HP at the beginning of your turn.\\nThe HP you recover in one turn is fairly small. As long as you remain in a\\nfortress, you\\'ll regain HP every turn, so a full recovery is possible.\\nThere are other places where units can recover HP, including castle gates,\\nthrones, and areas where bosses are found.\\n\\nThis chapter\\'s goal is to seize the throne.\\nThe leader of the enemy is on the throne now. Defeat him and have Lyn seize\\nthe throne to finish this battle.\\nHis name is Glass. He\\'s a sword-bearing mercenary. Think of the weapons\\ntriangle...\\nWhat weapon is able to best a sword? Correct! the lance! Using the right\\nweapon is like a shortcut to victory.\\nTo get into the altar, try using the method that you heard earlier.\\nIt\\'s up to you, Agung. Good luck.\\n\\nGlass : Who do you think you are? What chance do you think you have against\\n   me?\\n\\n\\nGlass : You... You... Urr... urgh...\\n\\nSometimes, you\\'ll get items after defeating enemies.\\nA single unit can carry a maximum of five items.\\nyou might need to drop some old items to pick up new ones.

Are you of the Lorca tribe?\\nLyn  : I\\'m Lyn, the chieftain\\'s daughter. Are you hurt, sir?\\nPriest : Thanks to you, I am unscathed. You have my gratitude.\\nLyn  : And the sword? Is it safe?\\nPriest : Yes, I have sealed the sword safely away. Until I remove my spell,\\n   the sword cannot be drawn. Now, as a token of my gratitude, I shall allow\\n   you to lay hands upon the Mani Katti. Touch the blade\\'s pattern, and pray\\n   for a safe journey.\\nLyn  : Oh, thank you so much!\\nPriest : Hm?\\nLyn  : What? Did-- The sword... It\\'s... glowing.\\nPriest : Ah. Hm... It\\'s the power of the spirits. Lyn, they have looked into\\n   your soul, and they call out to you.\\nLyn  : What does that mean?\\nPriest : You are its rightful owner. You are to wield the Mani Katti.\\nLyn  : No... I can\\'t... I couldn\\'t...\\nPriest : It is the sword\\'s wish. If you require proof, draw it from its\\n   sheath.\\nLyn  : Um... It came out... effortlessly.\\nPriest : I never dared to hope that I might meet the wielder of the Mani Katti\\n   in my life. I am indeed fortunate to see your sword reach your hands.\\nLyn  : My sword?\\nPriest : It is time for you to go, Lyn. You face a great many ordeals. Grip\\n   this sword, and meet your destiny head-on.\\nLyn  : Yes... Yes, sir!\\n\\nGot the Mani Katti.\\n\\nSain : So this is the Mani Katti. A blade with no equal.\\nLyn  : This is all so unbelievable. Perhaps the most famous sword in all of\\n   Sacae... in my hand.\\nKent : It\\'s not so strange. In fact, many legends tell similar tales...\\n   Special blades all over the land call out to their proper owners. And yet,\\n   when I saw you draw that blade, Lyndis... I felt something extraordinary.\\n   That sword was waiting for you. You were meant to draw it.\\nLyn  : Stop it! I... I\\'m nothing special!\\nSain : Think of it this way: Some weapons feel more comfortable in your\\n   hand, right? Well, the Mani Katti itself feels very comfortable with you.\\n   Does this make it any easier for you to accept? It doesn\\'t appear that\\n   either of us can use it.\\nLyn  : It... does feel right in my hand. A blade that only I can wield. That\\n   seems reasonable enough. I can understand that. Look at it, Agung. This\\n   is the Mani Katti. This is... my sword. I must care for it well.\\n\\nCastle Caelin :\\nLundgren : What? Madelyn\\'s daughter is still alive?\\nSoldier : Uh... Yes, Lord Lundgren. The girl is traveling with Kent and Sain.\\n   What are your orders? If we let them be...\\nLundgren : Bah! I\\'ve heard that northern Bern is full of bandits. She\\'s just\\n   a girl. She\\'ll not survive her journey here. I\\'m more concerned with my\\n   older brother. His life must be ended quickly. The poison... There must be\\n   no blunders.\\nSoldier : yes, m\\'lord. He suspects nothing and continues to drink it. The\\n   marquess\\'s death, due no doubt to \"sudden illness\", is not far off.\\nLundgren : Heh heh heh. Soon... Soon Caelin will be mine!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.3  CHAPTER THREE : BAND OF MERCENARIES\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe secrets of her past revealed in the words of two Knights of Lycia. Now,\\nto meet her grandfather, Lyn heads west, to Lycia, and to her destiny. A\\nmountain range separates the Sacae Plains from Bern. There are many bandits\\nlurking here, the crueslest of which are the Taliver.\\nThey wreak havoc on both Sacae and Bern, and their savagery knows no bounds.\\nOn her tenth days away from the plains, Lyn witnesses their atrocities\\nherself.\\n\\nLyn  : This place... It\\'s...\\nSain : The entire area is in ruins. Why doesn\\'t their marquess do anything to\\n   help?\\nLyn  : Taliver Mountain is home to a gang of vicious, ruthless bandits. No\\n   marquess holds power here. My village was near here, on the other side of\\n   the mountain. My people were.. The Taliver andits came at night. It took\\n   only one night. The survivors numbered less than ten, including me. They\\n   are soulless beasts. I will never forgive them. Never.\\nSain : Lyndis...\\nKent : ...\\nLyn  : I am not running away. I will be bac... someday. I\\'ll be stronger...\\n   I will break their sowrds beneath me like twigs beneath a stallion\\'s\\n   hooves. I will avenge my people. I\\'ll do everything in my power.\\nSain : When the time comes, bring me with you.\\nLyn  : Sain.\\nKent : Don\\'t forget me, either.\\nLyn  : Kent... Oh! You, too, Agung? I... You\\'re... thank you.\\n\\nMigal : Wait right there, little lady! What are you going to do to\\n   apologize? Huh?\\nFlorina : Uh... I... That is, I...\\nBrigand : hey, she\\'s quite a catch, eh, buddy? I bet the boss\\'d give us a\\n   pretty penny for her.\\nMigal : Yeah. She roughed me up a bit, so I figure fair\\'s fair. It\\'s no more\\'n\\n   she deserves.\\t\\nFlorina : I... I...\\nBrigand : What are we gonna do with her flying mule?\\nFlorina : Don\\'t you dare touch her!\\nBrigand : What? You just watch your mouth, girlie!\\nFlorina : Do what you will with me, just... Let her go. Please, I beg of you.\\nMigal : Ha ha ha! Silly twit! Pegasi can only be found in Ilia. They\\'re rare\\n   beasts, worth more than you by far! We can sell it for a mountain of gold.\\n   Let it go? HA!\\nFlorina : No, you can\\'t...\\nMigal : C\\'mon! Let\\'s move!\\nKent : What\\'s this? Be on your guard, Lyndis. There seems to be some sort\\n   of commotion over there.\\nLyn  : That\\'s... That\\'s a pegasus. Could it be? Florina? Is that you, Florina?\\nFlorina : Ah! Lyn?\\nLyn  : Florina! What are you doing in a place such as this?\\nFlorina : Lyn! Is it really you? I... I...\\nLyn  : Come now, no crying!\\nFlorina : I\\'m sorry.\\nKent : You are acquaintances?\\nLyn  : She\\'s my friend. This is Florina, a pegasus knight in trainig from Ilia.\\n   She\\'s a little uncomfortable around men. Tell me, Florina. What happened\\n   here?\\nFlorina : Well... um... When I heard that you had left... I decided to follow\\n   you. Then I saw this village... I flew down to ask if they had news of you.\\n   I didn\\'t see these two, and... well...\\nLyn  : Did your pegasus land on them?\\nFlorina : Well, I... A little...\\nBrigand : Aha! You heard her! She admits her fault! She stepped on my friend,\\n   and now she\\'s got to pay!\\nLyn  : Did you apologize, Florina?\\nFlorina : Yes! I told them I was sorry many times over. They just wouldn\\'t\\n   listen...\\nLyn  : Don\\'t cry. It\\'s all right.\\nFlorina : Lyn...\\nLyn  : Listen, she\\'s obviously sorry. Can\\'t we just let this pass? You don\\'t\\n   appear to be injured or anything.\\nTaliver : No chance. The girls goes with us-- by force if need be! Hey!\\n   C\\'mon out now, boys! The men are fair game, but don\\'t put a scratch on the\\n   girls!\\nLyn  : Agung! We\\'ve got to fight back!\\nFlorina : Lyn! I!\\nLyn  : You\\'re a pegasus knight, aren\\'t you? You can fight, can\\'t you?\\nFlorina : ...Yes!\\nLyn  : Listen carefully, Agung. We\\'re facing bandits. They\\'re underlings, but\\n   we can\\'t take them too lightly. Let\\'s clear them out of here. Are you\\n   ready? The layout around here might make it difficult to fight. The same\\n   holds true for our foe, too. If we use these walls just so, they may ensure\\n   our victory.\\nFlorina : Lyn... Who\\'s that?\\nLyn : This is Agung. He\\'s still an apprentice, but he\\'s my tactician.\\nFlorina : Oh, I see... Uh... Agung? I\\'m pleased to meet you.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe red-roofed buildings are villages. Villages are in danger of being\\nattacked. If an enemy unit reaches a village before one of our units does, the\\nvillage will be destroyed. As quickly as possible, visit the residents and\\ngive them warning. Only good can come of it. So, let\\'s visit them. Please\\nselect Lyn.\\n\\nLyn  : I\\'m to visit a village, right? Then issue the command.\\nLyn  : Is anyone there?\\nNPC  : Leave us alone, you thugs! Go away! Go away! We\\'ve no more gold for\\n   you!\\nLyn  : No, wait! Please! We\\'re not bandits! We want to help the village.\\n   Please listen!\\nWil  : Remain inside, everyone. I\\'ll go see what\\'s happening. Not bandits,\\n   huh? So, who are you?\\nLyn  : My name is Lyn. My colleagues and I are just traveling through here.\\n   We saw some bandits about. We\\'re going to deal with them, but... We need\\n   you to go and warn the villagers.\\nWil  : Hey! Wait! The name\\'s Wil. I\\'m a traveler of sorts, too. Listen, these\\n   villagers have been kind to me. Mind if I fight with you?\\nLyn  : Not at all. We need all the help we can get! Welcome aboard, Wil!\\n\\nBy visiting a village, we gained a new companion. Wil is an archer. He uses\\na bow to fight. Bows can be fired at foes more than 1 space away. Obstacles\\nwon\\'t affect your line of fire.\\nAttacking enemies without moving next to them is called indirect combat. If\\nthe enemy has no weapons capable of indirect combat, there\\'s no fear of\\ncounterattack, and that\\'s to our benefit.\\nHowever, you cannot fire on adjacent spaces. If someone moves next to you\\nand attacks, that\\'s it.\\nUnits with bows are best suited to lend assistance from the rear.\\nLet\\'s try some indirect combat, shall we? Select Wil.\\n\\nWil  : Hey, it\\'s me! Wil, remember? Why don\\'t you issue me a command?\\n   I\\'d love to help!\\n\\nNext is Florina, a pegasus knight. As you might guess, pegasus knight have\\nthe ability to fly. They can move over almost any terrain type. This small\\nwall would stop most units, but it poses no problem for a pegasus knight.\\nSelect Florina.\\n\\nFlorina : I... I am ready to fight. I\\'ll follow your orders...\\n\\nKnowing your units and their abilities and knowing how to use them in battle\\nis a shortcut to victory. To learn everything about a unit, place the cursor\\non that unit and press the R Button.\\n\\nFlorina : Lyn! What should I do? There\\'s an archer!!!\\nLyn  : What? Where!? Oh, that\\'s Wil.\\nWil  : Hi! You\\'re one of Lyn\\'s friends?\\nFlorina : Um... ... ...\\nWil  : What... What is it? Are you unwell?\\nLyn  : I\\'m sorry, Wil. Her name is Florina. She\\'s timid around men, and\\n   you... you\\'ve got a bow.\\nWil  : Oh! I see! You must be a pegasus kngiht! I apologize for frightening\\n   you, but I do understand your fear of bows.\\nFlorina : I... um... ...I\\'m sorry... Even looking... at a... bow... frightens\\n   me ever so much...\\nWil  : Of course, I understand! But you should really only fear the enemy\\'s\\n   archers, not your own.\\nFlorina : Yes... of course...\\n\\nUnits that fly, like pegasus knights, are very vulnerable to bow attacks.\\nArrows will deal critical damage to them. If the enemy has bow-wielding units,\\nyou must be extremely cautious.\\n\\nNPC  : You came to help the village? That\\'s good. With so many bandits, I\\n   wasn\\'t sure what to do. It\\'s not much, but please, take this money. There\\'s\\n   an armory to the southeast of us. Equip yourself as you see fit, and help\\n   us, please.\\n\\nWeapons have the strength to be used only a limited number of times. As you\\nfight, their endurance drops. At zero, the weapon breaks and disappears from\\nyour inventory. Check your weapon endurance by placing the cursor on a unit\\nand pressing R Button. You can also check on the item screen.\\nThe number next to the weapon is it\\'s endurance. Be careful. without a weapon\\na unit cannot enter combat.\\n\\nLyn and Migal\\nLyn  : Hey, listen! There\\'s something I wanted to ask you.\\nMigal : Begging for you life so soon, wench?\\nLyn  : Are you... Taliver bandits?\\nMigal : Taliver? Those greedy monsters? We\\'re nothing like them!! Those fiends\\n   will even kill women and children! We\\'re from Ganelon, and we know a little\\n   something of honor. We don\\'t harm women, for one thing. Heh heh heh. After\\n   all, why kill what you can sell?\\nLyn  : If you\\'re not Taliver, then there\\'s no reason for you to die here\\n   today. If you would like to tuck your tails and flee, do so now.\\nMigal : You... You... No more courtesies! You\\'re going to learn to watch your\\n   tongue!!!\\n\\nFlorina and Migal\\nFlorina : Um... Excuse me...\\nMigal : Huh? It\\'s you! So, you changed your mind about coming with us, eh?\\nFlorina : Well... no... But... this really is... my fault... Really... So,\\n   can we...\\nMigal : What?! C\\'mon, lass, out with it!\\nFlorina : I\\'m sorry. Can we... Can we just stop fighting now?\\nMigal : You\\'ve got to be kidding. After I\\'ve been made to look like a fool? No\\n   way!\\nFlorina : Eeek!\\nMigal:You\\'re coming with us! I promise you that!! Now, if you don\\'t want to\\n   get hurt, give yourself up!\\n\\nMigal : Draw your swords! We\\'re not listening to any of your stinking\\n   apologies!\\n\\nMigal:Ugh... You\\'ll live to regret this... My brothers... The Ganelon bandits\\n   will not let this stand...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : That\\'s finally taken care of!\\nFlorina : Lyn!\\nLyn  : Florina... Why did you follow me? It\\'s so dangerous.\\nFlorina : Do you remember the knighting ceremony of the Pegasus Knight of\\n   Ilia?\\nLyn  : Yes, you join a band of freelance soldiers to further your training.\\n   Is that what brought you here, Florina?\\nFlorina : Uh-huh. I wanted to talk to you before I set out. But when I went\\n   to Sacae, I heard that you had left with some strangers, and...\\nLyn  : You were worried for me? Thank you, but I\\'m more worried about you.\\nFlorina : Me?\\nLyn  : Listen, most mercenaries are men, right? Bands of men? I can\\'t imagine\\n   you being at all comfortable around them.\\nFlorina : I know, I know. It\\'s just... I\\'ve always dreamt of being a pegasus\\n   knight. I imagined I would just... work it out. Somehow. After today, I\\'m\\n   not so sure. Maybe I should just... give up.\\nLyn  : Florina... Don\\'t cry... Yes! There\\'s no reason to give up your dream!\\n   Hm?\\nSain : Lovely Florina! I have the most brilliant idea!\\nKent : Sain!\\nSain : You should come with us! With the addition of Wil here, we\\'re a fine\\n   group of soldiers, and freelance to boot!\\nWil  : Wait, did you just include me?\\nSain : Of course! We were destined to meet here! It\\'s fate! Come now, Lyndis\\'s\\n   band of mercenaries is as good a training group as you will find anywhere!\\nKent : Sain... This is no joking matter!\\nFlorina : Lyndis? Um, Lyn? Mercenaries?\\nLyn  : I can give you details later. This is all a bit rushed. However, Sain\\n   is right. Will you come with us, Florina?\\nFlorina : Travel with you, Lyn? Truly? I would be so... so happy!\\nSain : Fantastic! Beauteous Florina! I am a knight of Caelin. My name is\\n   Sain...\\nFlorina : Eeek! Stay back! Don\\'t get so close.\\nSain : Ah... Beautiful, and yet so modest!\\nKent : I beg your forgiveness. Calling us mercenaries...\\nLyn  : No, I approve. We can\\'t leave Florina on her own. She requires special\\n   attention, though. Can I count on you?\\nKent : Yes! You have but to ask.\\nWil  : So... Is it really all right if I travel with you?\\nLyn  : Oh, yes. Of course! If you\\'re willing, Wil.\\nWil  : Actually, I\\'m very grateful. Truth be told, all of my money was stolen,\\n   and I\\'m... at a bit of a crossroads. I would be honored to count myself one\\n   of Lyndis\\'s Legion!\\nLyn  : \"Lyndis\\'s Legion\"? This is getting stranger with every day, Agung.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.4  CHAPTER FOUR : IN OCCUPATION\\'S SHADOW\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter defeating the bandits, Lyn continues westward.\\nShe and her colleagues stop for the night at a ruined fortress.\\nThe Ganelon bandits are in a rage after their brethren fell to Lyn\\'s swords.\\nThey race in pursuit of the companions.\\nTheir angry footsteps sound closer and closer...\\n\\nWil  : Ah, this should suffice! Tonight\\'s bed!\\nSain : This mildewy old fortress? Is this the best we can do? Come, Wil!\\n   Surely you jest!\\nWil  : The bandits keep everything in turmoil around here. No one has time to\\n   worry about travelers. And there are rather a lot of us.\\nLyn  : This will be fine. Who wants to be stuck inside, anyway? I prefer a\\n   place where I can feel the wind blow.\\nFlorina : As long as I\\'m at Lyn\\'s side, I\\'ll be fine.\\nSain : And for your protection, your man-at-arms Sain will be right here by\\n   your side, ladies.\\nKent : Sain, both you and I are to remain awake. We will alternate the watch.\\nSain : Ah, alas...\\nNatalie : Your pardon, milady...\\nLyn  : Who\\'s there?\\nNatalie : I... Forgive my intrusion... My name\\'s Natalie. I\\'m from a village\\n   not far from here... Ah! Ow...\\nLyn  : Are you all right? Hm? Your leg...\\nNatalie : It\\'s fine. Don\\'t worry. It\\'s from a childhood sicknes... I can\\'t\\n   travel far on it, but it doesn\\'t trouble me much.\\nLyn  : What are you doing here all by yourself?\\nNatalie : I\\'m looking for my husband... I heard he was in this area. He said\\n   he wasy going to raise money to have my leg mended. He left the village\\n   and hasn\\'t returned. He\\'s a kindhearted man, but I think he might be\\n   involved in something dangerous. I got so worried... Here\\'s a sketchof him.\\n   It\\'s a poor likeness at best, but... His name is Dorcas. Do you know of\\n   him?\\nLyn  : I\\'m sorry. I don\\'t believe I\\'ve seen or heard of him.\\nNatalie : I see... If you do meet him, please give him a message. Tell him\\n   that Natalie is looking for him.\\nLyn  : I will tell him. I promise.\\n\\nCarjiga : Here they are. We\\'ve finally tracked down the band that defeated\\n   Migal.\\nBandit : So they\\'ve decided to hole up in this ruined fortress. Perfect. We\\'ll\\n   wait til it gets dark, and then...\\nCarjiga : You\\'are and idiot! There are only a few of them, and some are women!\\n   If we attacked them at night, I\\'d be a laughingstock! Besides, we might\\n   hurt the women by mistake! I will not be so wasteful!\\nBandit : You\\'re right, Carjiga! You\\'re so smart!\\nCarjiga : We\\'ll avenge Migal and get some pretty souvenirs to boot. Who knows,\\n   maybe I\\'ll be a leader after all. Ha ha ha! Let\\'s go! Spread out and\\n   encircle the place, you rogues! Let\\'s finish this before it gets too dark\\n   to see!\\n\\nCarjiga : Hey, you! Your name\\'s... Dorcas, right?\\nDorcas : ...\\nCarjiga : You haven\\'t done much since you joined us. If those weapons of yours\\n   aren\\'t just for show, today\\'s the day to let us see what you can do.\\nDorcas : ...\\nCarjiga : I want you to attack from the back entrance to the east. There\\'s\\n   supposed to be a woman inside. I want you to capture her. Do that, and\\n   I\\'ll incrase your share of the take. If you want gold, you\\'ll get the job\\n   done.\\nDorcas : A bunch of women, huh? It would break Natalie\\'s sweet heart to see\\n   me sink so low.\\n\\nKent : Lady Lyndis! Outside the fortress! Bandits!\\nLyn  : What did you say?\\nSain : Persistent bunch, aren\\'t they? What do you think? Shall we go out and\\n   face them?\\nLyn  : No... Natalie cannot move well, and that would put her in danger. Let\\n   them come to us. We\\'ll fight here, within these walls. Agung, take over.\\n   The command is yours. All we have to do is hold out until they tire and\\n   leave.\\nNatalie : Oh...\\nLyn  : Rest easy, Natalie. No one will harm you! Listen, everyone! Fight with\\n   caution!\\n\\nIn this chapter, your goal is protect a special character for a set period\\nof time. Keep Natalie safe for 7 turns. Agung, Natalie, and other green units\\nare called NPCs. NPCs are not enemies, but they cannot be moved or given\\norders. Sometimes, green units will be attacked because they are on the field\\nof combat. Be careful not ot let enemies close in on Natalie.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn : Agung! This fortress has two entrances. That\\'s where we must meet the\\n   enemy! I\\'ll take the eastern door. Agung, you and the others guard the\\n   main entrance.\\n\\nWhen the enemy far outnumbers your group, it\\'s safer to restrict the battle\\nto smaller areas. No matter how strong an enemy is, if he\\'s attacked on all\\nsides, he\\'s sure to take massive damage. So, the east door is Lyn\\'s, and the\\nsouth door is everyone else\\'s. Be on guard. Select Lyn, move her to the\\nspace indicated by the cursor, and have her wait.\\n\\nLyn  : Agung! The fighter who just attacked me... Doesn\\'t he look somewhat\\n   like that picture of Natalie\\'s husband?\\n\\nSometimes, you can speak with enemy characters. If you think you can converse\\nwith someone, move one of your units to an adjacent space. By and large,\\nyou\\'ll know whom to send from hints you receive in other conversations. When\\nyou\\'re not sure, just try using Lyn. Select Lyn now.\\n\\nLyn  : You! Tell me, are you Dorcas?\\nDorcas : ... How do you know my name?\\nLyn  : Natalie told me. What are you doing with these rogues?\\nDorcas : I need money.\\nLyn  : That may be, but... joining up with mercenaries?\\nDorcas : It\\'s the only way to earn gold in these parts. I\\'ll do anyting...\\n   even this.\\nLyn  : For gold? Anything? Would you hurt your wife? Natalie is here! We\\'re\\n   protecting her within this fortress!!\\nDorcas : What!? Natalie\\'s... She\\'s here?\\nLyn  : She was so worried that she came looking for you. Think, Dorcas!\\n   Would your actions please your wife?\\nDorcas : ... ... You\\'re right.\\nLyn  : Well?\\nDorcas : I understand. I can\\'t do this. I\\'m done with these bandits. Here\\n   and now.\\nLyn  : Really?\\nDorcas : Yes... And I would repay you for your kindness toward Natalie. Allow\\n   me to fight for you.\\n\\nIn this way, you can sometimes turn enemies into allies. Never underestimate\\nthe power of persuasive speech. Your new companion, Dorcas, is an axe-wielding\\nfighter. Do you remember the weapon triangle ? Axes are strong against lances\\nand weak against swords. Axes have more power than other weapons, but they\\nare also more difficult to hit with. Try using Dorcas to attack. Select Dorcas\\nnow.\\nThe weapon Dorcas is wielding is called a handaxe. Use it to attack an\\nadjacent opponent, or throw it in indirect combat in the manner of a bow.\\nThis versatility makes it a valuable weapon. It\\'s difficult to hit with,\\nthough, so don\\'t rely on it too much. Now let\\'s use the handaxe and try some\\nindirect combat.\\n\\nRight now, after all of your units have moved, it automatically becomes the\\nenemy\\'s turn, right?\\nSometimes, there are moments when you might not want or be able to move all\\nyour units.\\nWhen it\\'s bothersome to tell your units to wait one by one, select end from\\nthe map menu to speed things up. To display the map menu, place the cursor\\non an unoccupied space and press the A Button.\\n\\nCarjiga : What are you waiting for? She\\'s just a child! A Girl! Grrr! Get\\n   more men up here now!\\n\\nCarjiga : Urgh! How? Why are they so tough? You! Bring more men here right\\n   away!\\n\\nCarjiga : Arrgh.. This isn\\'t... Not me...\\n\\nText If Natalie was killed :\\nNatalie : Ah...\\nLyn  : I wasn\\'t strong enough... ...I couldn\\'t protect Natalie. I\\'m sorry,\\n   Mark... I need to be alone. ...I... I failed her when she needed help most.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBandit : Curses! They\\'re not human! Listen up, rogues! Retreat! Pull back!\\n\\nLyn : The enemy has fled! Agung! We\\'ve won!!!\\nNatalie : Dorcas!\\nDorcas : I\\'m so sorry, Natalie.\\nLyn  : All\\'s well that ends well. Right, Natalie?\\nDorcas : Our village is close. I\\'ll take Natalie home and return tomorrow.\\nLyn  : Hm? Why can\\'t we just say our farewells today?\\nDorcas : Well, I... I spoke with Agung. I... I\\'ve been invited to join your\\n   group.\\nLyn  : Bu we\\'re going to Lycia...\\nDorcas : I have to go somewhere to earn money. If you think I\\'ll be of use,\\n   I\\'d like to fight for you. You helped my wife... I owe you.\\nLyn  : Dorcas...\\nNatalie : Please, Lyn. We are both in agreement on this. Watch over my\\n   husband.\\n\\nLyn  : Things have finally calmed down.\\nKent : We\\'ll continue taking turns keeping watch. Please rest easily.\\nLyn  : Is that all right? Are you sure? Sain?\\nSain : Oh! Er, yes! Of course!\\nLyn  : Let me warn you... If bandits sneak up on you, they\\'ll cut you down\\n   without mercy. Do you understand that?\\nSain : What, do you doubt my bravery? Am I not a knight? There\\'s no need to\\n   worry! Right, Kent?\\nKent : If there\\'s anything suspicious, We\\'ll take care of it. Rest assured.\\nLyn  : Really? Well, good night then. See you tomorrow, Agung.\\nKent : Let\\'s go.\\nSain : Ha! No one ever trusts me...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.5  CHAPTER FIVE : BEYOND THE BORDERS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe next morning comes too quickly.\\nLyn has fought back the bandits\\' attack.\\nNow, she rushes for the border of Bern.\\nIf she can reach it, Lycia itself is not far off.\\nFor a moment, Lyn stops to imagine the face of a grandfather she\\'s never seen.\\n\\nKent : We\\'ve almost reached the Lycian border.\\nLyn  : Once we cross, we\\'ll be safe from the bandits, right?\\nWil  : We should be. I doubt they\\'ll be willing to pursue us accross the\\n   border.\\nSain : Lycia at last! It\\'s been a long time. Tomorrow, we\\'ll dine on a feast\\n   of Lycia\\'s finest foods! And the mistress of the inn at the crossing is\\n   said to be a beauty. Ah, ye... Food and love. No better way to restore a\\n   man\\'s sould! This is going to be a fine evening, eh, Kent?\\nKent : If your behavior is as deplorable as ever, we\\'d best stay elsewhere.\\n   We\\'re not here for sightseeing.\\nSain : Oh, come now! That\\'s not fair!\\nLyn  : Kent, the inn will be fine.\\nKent : As you say, milady.\\nSain : Lyndis! You are truly an angel from on high!\\nLyn  : It\\'s nothing. Forget it.\\nFlorina : Ah! We\\'ll finally be able to get a good night\\'s sleep.\\nLyn  : Oh, no... Those bandits are persistent, I\\'ll give them that much.\\n\\nBug : Ah! Here they are! I\\'ve found \\'em!!\\nWil  : What? Not again! They\\'re still after us?\\nBug : He he heh heh heh! Don\\'t think you\\'re getting away so esily!\\nBrigand : You leave alive, and everyone\\'ll think the Gaemlon bandits have gone\\n   soft.\\nLyn : So? We care nothingfor you or your reputations. We must get to Lycia!\\n   Get in our way, and you\\'ll pay!\\nBug : Cheeky little thing, aren\\'t you? Let\\'s get \\'em, lads! And no holding\\n   back just \\'cause there\\'s women with \\'em! Wipe \\'em out!\\n\\nSerra : Oooh... We\\'re lost. This makes me so mad!\\nErk  : You told me you were certain this was the correct path.\\nSerra : What\\'s your point, Erk? What are you trying to say?\\nErk  : ... I swear, you are NOT the woman I agreed to escort...\\nSerra : What? What\\'s that supposed to mean?\\nErk  : I heard someone was needed to escort a frail Lycian priestess to\\n   Ostia...\\nSerra : yes, and I\\'m that priestess.\\nErk  : Frail? You? Serra, you have no need of any escort to protect you. Even\\n   the most hardened criminal would flee in terror after five minutes in your\\n   company. I\\'ll return your money. Gladly. NOw, will you please go on to\\n   Ostia alone?\\nSerra : NO! Youre MY escort, Erk! MINE! You\\'re so clean and tidy. A noblewoman\\n   like myself can\\'t be seen without a proper escort. Your personality\\'s\\n   nothing special, but you\\'re not bad to look at.\\nErk  : I believe that\\'s my line. And I have to take you all the way to Ostia?\\n   I only hope my nerves can endure the journey.\\nSerra : What are you mumbling about? You\\'re so gloomy! Hm? Something\\'s\\n   happening over there. Let\\'s take a look!\\nErk  : Ah. Of course. The first opportunity to get involved in trouble, and\\n   she jumps right in. No amount of money is worth this. Hoo...\\n\\nSerra : Wow! A fight! A fight! Erk! Take a look! Fighting those bandits...\\n   It\\'s a young girl!\\nErk  : Fool! Keep your voice down!\\nBrigand : Eh? What\\'s this? You in league with that she-devil?\\nSerra : Hm?\\nErk  : Ah... This is so wrong...\\nBrigand : Gyaaa! I\\'ll take care of you with one swift stroke!\\nSerra : Eeeeeek! Eeeeeek! Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Erk! Help me!!!\\nErk  : So... loud... Serra! Behind me! You there! See if you can match me!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : That scream... Look! Agung, someone\\'s over there!\\n\\nSometimes, you can talk to different NPCS (the green units on the map). The\\nprocess is the same as talking to enemies. Give it a try. Please select Lyn.\\n\\nLyn  : You want me to talk to that person? Understood. Um, excuse me... Hello?\\nSerra : Hm?\\nLyn  : Why are you fighting these bandits?\\nErk  : ... It just happened.\\nSerra : That\\'s not true! Those ruffians thought that we were with you!!! You\\n   got us into a terrible situation! Now, how are you going to get us out?\\nErk  : Serra, if you\\'d not been so meddlesome, this all could have been\\n   avoided. My apologies. Please trouble yourself with us no more.\\nLyn  : But... if you\\'re going to have to fight anyway, shouldn\\'t we team up?\\n   It will end things faster, right?\\nSerra : That\\'s true. Yes! That\\'s a good idea. Erk! Go and help these ladies.\\nErk  : But I... Fine!\\nLyn  : Very good. My name\\'s Lyn. So, tell me, will you join arms with us?\\nSerra : Yes, we\\'d be glad to. My name is Serra, This is my escort, Erk. Be a\\n   good boy, and go fight now, Erk.\\nErk  : ...Sigh...\\n\\nErk, a mage, and Serra, a cleirc, have joined your group. Mages use the magic\\nof truth to attack and damage their enemies. Clerics use staves to restore\\nHP to their allies. Let\\'s try them both. First, select Serra.\\n\\nSerra : Hello. You\\'re Agung, right? I\\'m Serra. Nice to meet you. By the way,\\n   see this contrary mage here with me? His name is Erk. I think he\\'s been\\n   hurt. I am Erk\\'s employer. \"Master\", I suppose you could say. What I\\'m\\n   getting at is... I was thinking of healing him free of charge. I know, I\\n   know. I\\'m generous to a fault. Hm? Why are you looking at me like that?\\n   Praise my generosity! Anyway, that\\'s the deal. Please direct me to him.\\n\\nPress the A Button, and select staff from the menu.\\n\\nSerra : I\\'m going to use my staff. Watch in wonder!\\n\\nClerics cannot wield weapons; therefore they can\\'t engage in combat. However,\\nthey can use their staves to restore HP to allied units. Besides healing\\nstaves, which restore HP, there are other staves with different abilities.\\nIt\\'s always a good idea to test out any new abilities you receive, so let\\'s\\ndo that now.\\nHave Erk demonstrate his magic. Begin by selecting Erk.\\n\\nErk  : You are Agung? I am Erk. I\\'m not sure how I got in this mess. If I am\\n   going to fight, however, I will show you the true power of magic!\\n\\nMagic, like Dorcas\\'s throwing axes, can strike enemies in adjacent squares as\\nwell as those at a distance. It\\'s very useful. Magic can penetrate even the\\nstrongest defenses, so it can be used in many situations. However, mages have\\nfew HP and low defensive abilities. To avoid counter-attacks, move in close to\\narchers, and attack other fighters from 1 space away. Try and formulate battle\\nstrategies like this to be successful on the field of combat.\\n\\nHouse (11,3)\\nNPC  : Tell me, are you using the R Button? If there\\'s something you don\\'t\\n   understand, use the R Button to investigate. It\\'s essential. Place the\\n   cursor on a unit and press the R Button. This displays detailed information\\n   on the unit. You knew that, right ? While that information is displayed,\\n   press the R Button again. That will get you even more detailed information.\\n   Did you know that? The R Button can be used in many other places, too.\\n   Anyway, when you come across something unfamiliar, try pressing the R\\n   Button! Won\\'t hurt to remember that!\\n\\nHouse (9,7)\\nNPC  : Magic can be used to attack enemies both near and far. Plus, you\\n   might find that magic can hit an enemy that normal weapons do not harm.\\n   However... Mages are notoriously susceptible to physical attacks. Just\\n   because they\\'re versatile doesn\\'t mean you should put them in harm\\'s way.\\n   It does you no good if they are lost because of your carelessness.\\n\\nHouse (14,8)\\nNPC  : Ah, so you\\'re a traveler? Listen to my advice: handle your money\\n   wisely. If you spend too much too soon, you\\'ll run out early and suffer\\n   later. There are other shops, so save about, oh, half of your money.\\n\\nBug  : You\\'re gonna learn why people fear the Ganelon Bandits!\\n\\nBug  : Blaaaaah... Scum... You\\'re all scum...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : Nicely done, Agung. That should just about do it.\\nSerra : What a surprise. You are very strong, Lyn.\\nLyn  : Your staff is a wondrous thing. Healing powers amaze me.\\nSerra : only those in the service of good can wield them.\\nLyn  : You helped us tremendously. Well, it\\'s time for us to go.\\nSerra : Take care. Good-bye, Lyn.\\nLyn  : Fare you well. You, too, Erk.\\nErk  : Good-bye.\\nSerra : Well, let us be on our way, Erk.\\nSain : What have we here? Another wildflower? Perhaps a butterfly? What an\\n   absolutely delectable creature!\\nSerra : Oh my! Are you one of Lyn\\'s companions?\\nSain : Please, call me Sain.\\nSerra : I\\'m Serra. I serve House Ostia.\\nSain : Serra... What a lyrical name. I am in service to Castle Caelin.\\nSerra  : Oh! So is Lyn a member of the marquess\\'s family?\\nSain : She is the granddaughter of our lord, the marquess.\\nSerra : Hmmm... Such an important person.\\nErk  : Serra... what deviousness are you contemplating now?\\nSerra : Tee hee! Having a person of power in your debt is never a bad thing!\\nErk  : You can\\'t be serious...\\nSerra : Oh, Sain! Do you think we could join the lady Lyndis\\'s company? She\\n   seems like such a nice person, and I would ever so much like to help her.\\nSain : Of course! We couldn\\'t be happier!! Why, we were only just saying how\\n   we need some more fighting power!\\nSerra : Are you being hunted or something?\\nSain : Yes, it\\'s an inheritance dispute. Assassins everywhere.\\nSerra : Oh my! In that case, my healing staff and Erk\\'s magic should come in\\n   handy.\\nErk  : Well, I, er... It sounds... dangerous...\\nSain : Your staff and magic would be extremely helpful! Please wait here! I\\n   will go and speak with Lady Lyndis on your behalf.\\nErk  : Unbelievable...\\nSerra : This is fantastic, Erk! Our good deeds will earn us gratitude beyong\\n   imagining!\\nErk  : I... I... I think I\\'m going to be ill.\\n\\nCastle Caelin\\nLundgren : That little girl crossed the border!?\\nSoldier : Yes, Lord Lundgren. She\\'s en route to Araphen...\\nLundgren : Fool! Send out soldiers to meet her! Hold nothing back! Do anything\\n   to finish this now! First the old man, and now the girl... They cling to\\n   life like a drowning man to a rock! Double the poison\\'s strength! If he\\n   struggles, hold him down and pour it down his throat! Once the girl is\\n   gone, Caelin is mine. I will let no one stand in my way!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.6  CHAPTER SIX : BLOOD OF PRIDE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt long last, Lyn arrives in the land of her mother\\'s birth.\\nLycia is a federation of territorise, each one ruled by a powerful marquess.\\nNow, Lyn takes her leave of one of these territories, Araphen, and sets out\\nto meet her grandfather, the marquess of Caelin. However, the marquess\\'s\\nbrother, Lundgren, hungers to rule Caelin. He is preparing a deadly welcome\\nfor Lyn, who stands to threaten his grasp for power.\\n\\nLyn  : What city is this?\\nSain : This? This is Araphen. After Ostia, it\\'s the second biggest city in\\n   Lycia.\\nLyn  : The second biggest, hm? It does seem awfully busy. By the way, where\\'s\\n   Kent?\\nSain : He said he was going ahead to the castle, but... Ah, here he comes now.\\nKent : Milady Lyndis! Let us proceed to the castle. They\\'ve prepared supplies\\n   for us. The marquess has agreed to aid us on our journey to Caelin.\\nLyn  : He\\'s going to help us?\\nKent : Yes. Araphen and Caelin have enjoyed a sturdy friendship for many\\n   years. Once I informed the marquess of our plight, he agreed to lend us\\n   his strength.\\nSain : Looks like we\\'ve got a smooth road ahead!\\nKent : If we could pick up some soldiers, the road to Caelin would be that\\n   much safer. I\\'m truly sorry for hardships you\\'ve suffered so far.\\nLyn  : Don\\'t be silly. You are so capable, Kent.\\nSain : Kent!?\\nLyn  : Hm? OH, and so are you, Sain.\\nSain : Of course I am!\\nKent : The castle awaits...\\n\\nNPC1 : This is terrible! The castle is burning!!\\nSain : What did you say? What\\'s happening?\\nNPC1 : Smoke! From the castle! Hey! What are those men doing?\\nLyn  : Who are you?\\nAssassin  : You! You\\'re Lyndis, aren\\'t you?\\nLyn  : Ah! What do you--\\nAssassin : No questions! Prepare yourself!!!\\nLyn  : Hey!\\nRath :\\nAssassin : Aaaargg! Aaaaah!!\\nLyn  : What? An arrow?\\nRath : ...\\nLyn  : Who are--\\nKent : Milady Lyndis! Are you all right?\\nLyn  : I\\'m fine. He... This man saved me.\\nKent : May I ask your name?\\nRath : ...\\nLyn  : Wait! Why did you help me?\\nRath : I thought a Sacaean plainswoman was being attacked. I was mistaken.\\nLyn  : No, you were right! I am from Sacae. I\\'m Lyn, the daughter of the Lorca\\n   chieftain.\\nRath : The Lorca? There were survivors?\\nLyn  : Yes.\\nRath : You should leave at once. A blaze has started in the castle, and it\\'s\\n   spreading. Don\\'t be foolish and waste the life I just saved.\\nLyn  : You\\'re from the castle? What\\'s happening? How severe is the fire? Is\\n   the marquess safe?\\nRath : The castle is under attack, and the marquess has been accosted. The\\n   man who attacked you was probably one of the marauders. As captain of the\\n   castle guard, it\\'s my duty to rescue the marquess.\\nLyn  : I see... All right then, we\\'ll help you.\\nKent : Milady?\\nRath : Why?\\nLyn  : These brigands are after me. If they\\'re attacking the castle, it\\'s\\n   because of me. So I must help if I can...\\nRath : It sounds like you\\'re involved somehow... Let\\'s go.\\nLyn  : You\\'ll accept our aid?\\nKent : ...\\nRath : I am Rath of the Kutolah. Our tribes may be different, but I will not\\n   abandon a woman of the Sacae.\\nLyn  : Thank you, Rath! A thousand blessings upon you!\\nRath : And a thousand curses upon our enemy!\\nLyn  : Come!\\n\\nNPC2 : You! What are you doing in my house?!\\nMatthew : Peace! I mean no danger to you! Your home offers a good view of the\\n   battle outside. Look, I\\'ll pay you for the privilege. Please.\\nNPC2 : Like a vulture waiting for the spoils, eh? Terrible! Pay up! I\\'ll be\\n   hiding below, so don\\'t bother me.\\nMatthew : I wouldn\\'t dream of it. Now then, which side has the most to offer?\\n\\nRath : Once the marquess is safe, my men can move in. Perhaps the secret\\n   passageway....\\nLyn  : Secret passageway?\\nRath : An underground tunnel leading to the throne room. There are triggers\\n   in the barracks that will open the tunnel.\\nLyn : Head through the passage to the throne room... and rescue the marquess.\\n   Once that\\'s done, can you drive the enemy from the castle?\\nRath : Mmm... If we can release those triggers, my men and I can handle the\\n   rest. There are three triggers, though. All three need to be released, or\\n   the entrance won\\'t open.\\nLyn  : But the doors to the barracks are locked.\\nRath : The enemy\\'s within. If we don\\'t get inside and finish them, we\\'re\\n   stuck.\\nLyn  : So opening those doors is our first objective.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe goal of this chapter is to open the doors and reach the 3 triggers located\\ninside. To open doors, you need door keys or the services of a thief.\\n\\nLyn  : What shall we do, Agung? We don\\'t have any keys with us. Perhaps some\\n   of the marauders are carrying keys...\\n\\nThere may be times when you are unsure how to proceed. Start by checking\\nStatus on the Map Menu. Visiting homes or villages is also a good way to get\\ninformation. Who knows what hints you might find. Let\\'s try visiting a house.\\nPlease select Lyn.\\n\\nVillage (5,12)\\nMatthew : Hey, you! Can I talk to you?\\nLyn  : Who are you?\\nMatthew : I\\'m Matthew, a specialist in acquisitions of all kinds. Would you\\n   like to buy my services?\\nLyn  : I\\'ve no need for a thief.\\nMatthew : Really? And how do you plan on opening the barrack doors?\\nLyn  : What? How did you know about--\\nMatthew : Bullseye!\\nLyn  : ...\\nMatthew : Don\\'t be mad. Hire me. For you, I\\'ll even lower my normal rate.\\nLyn  : I do need those doors opened. OK. You\\'re hired. Why did you choose to\\n   ally yourself with me?\\nMatthew : Hm? I was watching the battle from up above. Your group looked like\\n   a lot more fun than the dead guy. Pretty simple, really.\\nLyn  : You\\'re so odd.\\nMatthew : It\\'s time to get to work!\\n\\nThe thief Matthew has joined your group. Thieves have picks, which they use\\nto open doors and chest. Picks are usable by thieves alone. It\\'s time to\\nopen that door. Select Matthew.\\n\\nMatthew : Pardon! You\\'re Agung, right? I\\'m Matthew.\\n\\nThe door has been opened. With that, you can also see inside the room behind\\nthe door. Within the room there\\'s a different-colored floor tile. Tiles that\\nseem different in some way might be the triggers we\\'re looking for. Select\\nRath, move him to that tile, and order him to wait. Triggers can be released\\nby having allied units wait on them.\\n\\nRath : That takes care of the first one. Two more to go.\\n\\n\\nVillage (8,6)\\nNPC  : We can\\'t do business with all the fighting in town. You\\'re mercenaries,\\n   right? Can\\'t you do something? Huh? You can\\'t get the barracks open? I bet\\n   a thief with a set of picks could open any door you needed. Hold on. I may\\n   have something here to help you. Here it is! This is it. One door key. Door\\n   key can only be used once, but anyone can use them. Here! No charge. Now go\\n   get those thugs, will you?\\n\\nGet a Door key.\\n\\nVillage (2,7)\\nNPC  : So what\\'s your weapon of choice? Swords, lances, spears? Or do you\\n   favor bows or magic? Staves? Whatever it may be, the more you use it, the\\n   more skilled you become. Swinging your sword about will allow you to master\\n   it. Eventually, you\\'ll be able to wield weapons of greater power. It\\'s as\\n   they say: Practice makes perfect. You can check your skill level by\\n   pressing the R Button.\\n\\nVillage (5,2)\\nNPC  : The captain of the marquess\\'s guard is a fellow named Rath... I\\'ve\\n   heard tell that he\\'s a nomad from the plains of Sacae. Odd, considering\\n   how the marquess so obviously hates the nomads. I guess the marquess is\\n   pleased to have a nomad under his control. The ways of aristocrats are\\n   beyond my comprehension.\\n\\nVillage (3,12)\\nNPC6 : The marquess of Araphen\\'s hatred for the people of Sacae is well\\n   known. Nomads are barred entrance to the city on the marquess\\'s orders.\\n   He says he will not allow the nomads\\' stench to infect his city. Long\\n   ago, the marquess was in love with Marquess Caelin\\'s daughter. It\\'s said\\n   she spurned him in favor of a nomadic prince. Even so, I think the\\n   marquess goes too far in his treatment of the horsemen.\\n\\nMatthew : Hey! Unless my eyes deceive me, that\\'s a chest! Say, Agung! Since\\n   we came all this way, what say we help ourselves? Huh? What do you mean,\\n   \"No\"? Don\\'t be such a bore. If you want to win, you\\'ve got to use every\\n   means at your disposal. That\\'s an ironclad rules! Yeah, I know stealing\\'s\\n   bad. I\\'m well aware of that. We\\'re saving the marquess, right? Let\\'s just\\n   call this an advance on our reward, OK?\\n\\nThieves can use their picks to open chests. Move Matthew onto the chest, and\\nthe chest command will appear. Choose this command, and the contents of the\\nchest will become yours. Why don\\'t we see what we can find? Go ahead and\\nselect Matthew.\\n\\nMatthew : Hey! Changed your mind? Hurrah! Treasure time! Treasure time!\\n\\nGot an angelic Robe.\\n\\nMatthew : Hey! This is an angelic robe. This is good for those of us on the...\\n   less robust side. Like me, for example. Magic items like this that increase\\n   one\\'s abilities vanish after being used. Give them to the people who need\\n   them most. But don\\'t fret too much about it, or you\\'ll never use them.\\n   Simply holding on to a useful item does no one any good.\\n\\nAn angelic robe increases a character\\'s max HP by a small amount. Select the\\nitem on the item list and use it. To view more detailed information on items,\\npress the R Button on the item list. A thief has the skill to open doors and\\nchests, right? That ability can only be utilized if the thief has a set of\\npicks. The number next to an item is the number of times the item can be used\\nbefore the item breaks. Keep that in mind.\\n\\nMatthew : An armorslayer! Just as the name suggests, armorslayers are useful\\n   against knights in armor. You want to know something? You need to give\\n   weapons to those who can wield them. Otherwise, it\\'s just a waste of a\\n   perfectly good weapon. Take this blade, I mean. I can use it, but... I\\'m\\n   not too strong, and... I just hate being counterattacked. Anyway, think\\n   strategically about who you wipe weapons to.\\n\\nIf you get a weapon or staff you can\\'t use, don\\'t worry. Other members of your\\nparty might be able to wield them. Item\\'s you cannot use appear in gray text.\\nTry trading, these items to others in your group. Don\\'t forget: you can only\\ntrade items with one other character at a time.\\n\\nBool : Bah. Lyndis and her cadre. When did you arrive? No matter. I shall deal\\nwith you.\\n\\nBool : Gah! Lord Lundgren...\\n\\n\\nFlorina : Hey... This just might be the last trigger. So, I only need to...\\nLyn  : Here it is, Agung! The hidden passageway! Good work! We\\'ll Rath take\\n   over from here.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMarquess : Ah, it\\'s Rath! You\\'ve done well. What a performance!\\nRath : Sir... If you have praise, it should be given to this group.\\nMarquess : Hm? Who are you?\\nLyn  : My name is Lyndis. I\\'m pleased you\\'re well.\\nMarquess : Oh... It\\'s you. You\\'re Marquess Caelin\\'s--- Leave us, Rath. I would\\n   speak with this girl.\\nRath : ...\\nMarquess : Now... Lady Lyndis. Do you know the identity of those responsible\\n   for this uproar?\\nLyn  : I believe it to be the work of my granduncle, Lundgren.\\nMarquess : That\\'s exactly right. Whih means my castle has been damaged in your\\n   family\\'s petty inheritance dispute.\\nLyn  : My-My apologies...\\nMarquess : When I heard that Lady Madelyn\\'s daughter was in trouble, I thought\\n   to lend my assistance... I find I\\'ve changed my mind. I withdraw my offer.\\nKent : Marquess Araphen! You gave me your word, my lord!\\nMarquess : Your name is Kent, is it not? You failed to inform me of one most\\n   vital detail!\\nKent : What... What do you mean?\\nMarquess : This girl does resemble Lady Madelyn, but... I didn\\'t expect to\\n   see her so tainted with the blood of Sacae.\\nLyn  : What?!?\\nMarquess : Don\\'t you feel the marquess of Caelin would be troubled to meet\\n   this... nomadic mongrel?\\nSain : You--!\\nKent : Sain! Hold! My apologies, my lord Marquess.\\nMarquess : Hm... Your man is poorly disciplined.\\nKent : Marquess Araphen! Please... If you would grace us with your aid...\\nMarquess : ... I hear Marquess Caelin is ill and abed. I question whether he\\n   will survive to meet this girl. In which case, his brother, Lundgren, will\\n   claim his title. And I certainly wish to avoid trouble with the coming\\n   marquess.\\nSain : You scheming...\\nLyn  : Sain! I understand. Kent, Sain, we take our leave at once.\\nKent : Milady Lyndis! We--\\nLyn  : I am proud of the Sacae blood that runs through my veins. I will NOT\\n   accept aid from one who disparages my heritage.\\n\\nSain : That was well done, milady! The marquess is a lout. Don\\'t worry about\\n   anything. We\\'re all here for you! Isn\\'t that so, Kent?\\nKent : I beg your forgiveness.\\nLyn  : Why are you apologizing, Kent?\\nKent : I\\'ve been so concerned with seeing you to Caelin. I failed to take\\n   your feelings into account.\\nLyn  : Is that it? Trouble yourself no more. You have put my safety above all\\n   else. I have seen that... Hold your head up and be proud.\\nKent : Milady Lyndis...\\n\\nMarquess : Bah! Arrogant child! If she had but shed a single tear, I would\\n   have granted her request. We Lycian nobles will never understand those\\n   prideful savages.\\nRath : ... Are those your true feelings toward the nomads of Sacae, milord?\\nMarquess : What? Oh, Rath! I didn\\'t see you there. My comments do not reflect\\n   on you. Yo are my captain. I\\'m proud of your service.\\nRath : Of course. As long as we bend our knee to you, you care not where\\n   we\\'re from. But when an equal comes from my lands? What conceit.\\nMarquess : Rath! How can you speak to me like that? I have treated you well,\\n   have I not? I have paid you well. I have treated you better than your kind\\n   deserves.\\nRath : You will never understand. My service ends here.\\n\\nLyn  : The marquess of Araphen... He said my grandfather was ill. We must\\n   hurry to Caelin...\\nKent : As we approach Caelin, Lundgren\\'s obstacles will be more difficult to\\n   overcome. However, I\\'ve vowed to see you through to the end, milady!\\nLyn  : I\\'m counting on you, Kent.\\nSain : I\\'m with you, too!\\nLyn  : Thank you, Sain. Agung... Thank you for always standing at my side.\\n   It\\'s because of all of you that I... I will persevere! They will never\\n   break my spirit!\\n\\nRath : ...\\nLyn  : Rath! WHAT IS IT? What are you--\\nRath : I overheard the marquess talking to himself. Lyn of the Lorca...\\n   Proud daugther of the Sacae... I would join you. I would add my strength\\n   to yours.\\nLyn  : Really?\\nRath : And this... I want you to take it.\\nLyn  : This is... Gold!? It\\'s too much. I can\\'t accept it.\\nRath : I have no need for it. And if it will help you...\\nLyn  : But...\\nRath : I cannot take back something once offered.\\nLyn  : Rath... I thank you.\\n\\nGot 5000 Gold.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.7  CHAPTER SEVEN : SIBLINGS ABROAD\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn takes her leave of Araphen, finding no aid from its spiteful marquess.\\nNow, she and her companions resume their march toward Caelin in earnest.\\nRacing against time, with here grandfather\\'s life the price. Harried and\\nimpatient, Lyn presses onweard. Suddenly a young boy appears and pleads for\\ntheir assistance.\\n\\nNils : Please! Somebody... Somebody, please help!\\nNPC1 : That\\'s enought! Get out now! I want none of your trouble!\\nNils : But, sir... Why? YOu were so kind yesterday...\\nNPC1 : I thought your were just two kids, a couple of traveling performers...\\n   If those men are chasing you, you must be up to no good! Now get up and\\n   get out! You\\'re a plague on decent folk!\\nNils : But.......\\nNPC1 : Whew... What a mess.\\n\\nLucius : Hmmm...\\n\\nLyn  : Where are we, Kent?\\nKent : This is Kathelet. If we head due south, we\\'ll pass into Caelin.\\nSain : From here, I\\'d say we\\'re about ten days\\' ride to Castle Caelin.\\n   Assuming we don\\'t run into any delays, of course.\\nLyn  : Ten days...\\n\\nNils : Pardon me, but...\\nLyn  : Yes? Can I help you?\\nNils : You and your friends... Are you mercenaries?\\nLyn  : And if we are?\\nNils : I need your help!\\nKent : Milady Lyndis, you musn\\'t let your guard down. Not even for a child.\\nLyn  : I know. Forgive me, but we\\'re in a hurry. Is there someone else you can\\n   ask?\\nNils : There\\'s not time! Ninian\\'s been... It\\'s my sister! Some men have taken\\n   her away!\\nSain : Your sister? Did you say your sister\\'s been accosted?\\nKent : Sain...\\nNils : That\\'s right! By some cruel, awful men. I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do\\n   without Ninian.\\nSain : Milady Lyndis! We must help him!\\nKent : Nonsense! We haven\\'t the time! If the marquess is as ill as we\\'ve\\n   heard, we must proceed!\\nLyn  : Kent, I... I want to help this child.\\nKent : Milady?\\nLyn  : I\\'m worried about my grandfather, of course. But this! I cannot stand\\n   by and let a child be taken from her home!\\nKent : I see...\\nLyn  : I\\'m sorry, Kent.\\nKent : I\\'m your loyal retainer. You owe me no apologies. You must do as your\\n   heart dictates, milady. I will follow you, no matter where that may lead.\\nLyn  : Thank you.\\nSain : Hah! Such a noble speech! Ever the true knight, that one! Ah, well.\\n   You\\'re in luck, laddie! Let\\'s go get your sister!\\nLyn  : Will you lead us to the men who\\'ve done this?\\nNils : Uh huh. They\\'re really tough, so be careful.\\nLyn  : Leave them to us. We\\'re pretty tough ourselvs. Right, Agung?\\n\\nNils : Ah! Oh, no...\\nAssassin : Heh heh heh... Found him! C\\'mon, it\\'s back to Nergal with you.\\n   Quiest now.\\nNils : No! Let Ninian go!\\nAssassin : We ain\\'t supposed to kill you, but we sure can rough you up! Get\\n   \\'em!\\nAssassin : Huh? Who do you think you are?\\nNils : Lyn!\\nLyn  : Let the boy\\'s siser go.\\nAssassin : Ah... So you want to help the kid, huh? What a shame. You\\'re gonna\\n   die for something that don\\'t concern you.\\nLyn  : You think so, do you? Do we look so meek to you? I think you\\'re in for\\n   a terrible shock!\\nAssassin : Stupid girl... You\\'ll regret those words. Take \\'em down, boys!\\n\\nStarting with this chapter, you\\'ll be able to use the preparations screen.\\nOn this screen, you can choose who will fight, equip different items, and\\narrange your formation, among other things. If you have no special\\npreparations to make, simply press START. This starts the chapter with the\\nsame group you were using at the end of the last chapter.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : I see we\\'re facing a shaman, Agung. I\\'ve heard that practitioners of\\n   the dark arts are feasome foes. We\\'ll have to be careful... What!? Who are\\n   you?\\nLucius : Please forgive me. I never meant to startle you.\\nLyn  : Your robes... They look liek religious vestiary. Are you an Elimine\\n   bishop?\\nLucius : Yes... Well, no. I\\'m only an acolyte, an Elimine monk, to be\\n   specific. My name\\'s Lucius.\\nLyn  : Do you have business with us?\\nLucius : I was at the inn when this child came seeking help. The innkeeper\\n   was afraid to get involved. He was... unpleasant.\\nNils : I wan\\'t afraid of him! I\\'m used to being treated that way.\\nLyn  : That\\'s awful.\\nLucius : May I please lend you my services? I truly wish to help the boy. If\\n   only a little.\\nLyn  : Of course.\\nLucius : Thank you very much. The blessings of St. Elimine be upon you\\n\\nThe monk Lucius has joine your group. Monks are users of the magic of light.\\nThose who wield magic are highly attuned to its flow, so they have a high\\nmagic resistance. Units with high magic resistances can reduce the damage\\ncaused by magical attacks. When magic users battle each other, they often\\nfind it hard to inflict damage. The light magic of monks is strong against\\nthe dark magic favored by shamans. Lucius should come in handy here. Let\"s\\nput his magic to the test. Have Lucius attack the shaman nearest him.\\n\\nLucius : You wish me to attack the shaman? Very well.\\n\\nNils : I can help, too!\\nLyn  : Nils! Can you fight?\\nNils : No... But I\\'m a bard, and bards are useful to have around!\\nLyn  : A bard? Do you mean you\\'re a minstrel? This is no place for a ballad\\n   or a saltarello.\\nNils : C\\'mon, trust me! I\\'m all yours, Agung.\\n\\nIt\\'s time to see what Nils can do. The music played by bards allows your\\nallies to move twice in the same turn. However, bards cannot engage in combat,\\nso be careful not to expose them to danger.\\n\\nNils : You\\'d like me to play for Lucius, right?\\n\\nNils : What do you think?\\nLyn  : That was lovely... Invigorating, even. You ought to play for me\\n   sometime. I could use the boost!\\nNils : Everyone could! My music can refresh you all!\\n\\nThrough the power of Nil\\'s music, Lucius can move again this turn. Bards gain\\nexperience by playing music. Use Nils\\'s powers often, and increase his skill.\\n\\nHouse (4,12)\\nNPC  : Hmmm... Maybe I could get some firewood out of it... Hm? Who\\'s there?\\n   Who are you? Ah, you\\'re just passing through? Pay me no mind. I was just\\n   thinking out loud. Yu see, there\\'s an old tree on the other side of this\\n   mountain. It\\'s just a dead old snag, really. I was just thinkingof some way\\n   I could put it to good use. As I said, it\\'s nothing that need concern you.\\n\\nHouse (5,13)\\nNPC  : That\\'s quite a group you\\'ve gotten yourself involved with. You do know\\n   you\\'re facing the Black Fang, right? Anyone they target winds up... Well,\\n   you know. No one escapes the Fang! That\\'s what they say, anyway. You and\\n   those odd children? I\\'d say you\\'re finished. Not that I\\'ll have any part of\\n   it. Course not!\\n\\nVillage (18,12)\\nNPC  : So how much do you know about magic, huh? Magical attacks are special.\\n   You can\\'t just avoid \\'em like a sword or an axe. Not even if you\\'re\\n   wearing armor. Who\\'s tough against magic? Let me think... Well, anyone\\n   who uses magic or staves. Pegasus knights, too. Hm? You got others who\\n   need to battle magic users? I got something for \\'em. It\\'s a special kind\\n   of water. \"Pure water,\" it\\'s called. Just sprinkle a bit on you. It\\'ll\\n   protect you and lessen the damage you take a bit. Go on, take it. Don\\'t\\n   be shy. It\\'s not like I\\'m givin\\' you gold or anything. This stuff\\'s\\n   strongest when you first put it on. It gets weaker as time passes, so\\n   be careful.\\nGot a Pure Water.\\n\\n\\nHeintz : Who are you supposed to be? Playing the heroes in some foolish\\n   knightly romance? You may think you\\'re helping the children, but you\\'re\\n   only rushing to your doom!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHeintz : You were only... striking at air... You are... too late. The girl\\n   is already--\\n\\nLyn  : Nils! Where\\'s your sister?\\nNils : Ninian! Ninian... She\\'s not here. Why? Where could she be?\\nKent : My lady Lyndis! A villager spotted a group of men riding south.\\nSain : The boy\\'s dear sister... They must have her!\\nLyn  : Come! We must give chase!\\nNils : But... But... We won\\'t make it! What if they\\'ve already...\\nEliwood : Are you looking for this girl here?\\nNils : Ninian! Ninian!\\nEliwood : She\\'ll be fine. She\\'s just lost consciousness.\\nLyn  : Who are you?\\nEliwood : I\\'m Eliwood, of Pherae. My father is the marquess.\\nLyn  : The marquess\\'s son.\\nEliwood : She was with a band of ruffians. She seemed upset. She looked in\\n   need of rescuing... Was I wrong to involve myself?\\nLyn  : No, you saved her life. Thank you. My name is Lyn. I\\'m from Sacae. I\\'m\\n   Marquess Caelin\\'s granddaughter.\\nEliwood : Marquess Caelin?\\n\\nLyn  : And that\\'s my story. It\\'s not an easy tale to believe, I know...\\nEliwood : No. I do believe you.\\nLyn  : What?\\nEliwood : At first glance, all I saw was a daughter of the plainsfolk. Now I\\n   can see it, though. You have your grandfather\\'s eyes.\\nLyn  : Do you know my grandfather?\\nEliwood : The marquess, Lord Hausen, is my father\\'s good friend. I also know\\n   that the proud people of Sacae tell no lies. It\\'s true, isn\\'t it?\\nLyn  : Yes... Thank you. I would not have expected any Lycian noble to be so\\n   courteous to a Sacaean nomad.\\nEliwood : You seemed to be in trouble. May I be of assistance?\\nLyn  : Thank you fo ryour kind offer. This is my problem, though, and I\\'ll\\n   deal with it.\\nEliwood : I see. I\\'ll be in the area for a few days longer. If you need\\n   anything, please let me know. Lyndis, I\\'m on your side.\\nLyn  : Eliwood... Thank you.\\n\\nNils : Ninian! Are you awake?\\nNinian : Nils? Is it really you? Oh, you\\'re safe!\\nNils : Uh-huh. These people helped me.\\nNinian : Who are they?\\nNils : Uh...\\nLyn  : I\\'m Lyn. I\\'m glad you\\'re feeling better.\\nNinian : Milady Lyn... Thank you. I\\'m called Ninian. My brother, Nils, and I\\n   are traveling performers.\\nNils : Both of you? Your brother\\'s a musician. How about you, Ninian?\\nNinian : I... I dance.\\nSain : What? Oh my... you\\'re a dancer!\\nLyn  : Sain... Later, please.\\nSain : Um, yeah. Of course.\\nLyn  : A dancer? Your clothes don\\'t look like those of a dancer.\\nNils : Ninian dances to honor life. It\\'s special... Sacred.\\nLyn  : A sacred dance? What does that mean?\\nNinian : I... The dance I perform when we travel is just a normal dance. My\\n   other dance, though... When they caught me, I twisted my ankle. I cannot\\n   dance to aid you... I\\'m sorry.\\nLyn  : Please don\\'t worry. We\\'re just happy to see that you\\'re out of harm\\'s\\n   way.\\nNinian : Thank you.\\nLyn  : But I am concerned about your leg. You can\\'t travel on it...\\nNils : I\\'ve an idea. Would it be too much to ask that we travel with you?\\nLyn  : I can\\'t allow that! It\\'s far too dangerous. We\\'re being hunted. We\\n   never know when we\\'re going to be attacked.\\nNils : We wouldn\\'t be a hindrance. We could even help you. Right, Ninian?\\nNinian : Yes. We might be able to repay our deb using our... special talents.\\nLyn  : Special abilities ?\\nNinian : When something poses a threat to us, we can sense its approach.\\nLyn  : Truly? That\\'s amazing!\\nNils : We can feel it coming, but we can\\'t do anything to stop it. You\\'re\\n   warriors, though, so you don\\'t have that worry.\\nLyn  : What do you think, Kent?\\nKent : I think leaving them here would cause Lady Lyndis more worry than\\n   having them travel with us.\\nLyn  : Sain? Oh, never mind. I know what your answer is. Do you really want\\n   to travel with us?\\nNils : Of course!\\nNinian : You have our gratitude, milady.\\n\\nNinian : Oh...\\nNils : What\\'s wrong, Ninian?\\nNinian : I\\'ve lost my ring.\\nLyn  : Your ring?\\nNils : Not Ninis\\'s Grace?\\nNinian : The very one.\\nNils : They stole it? Those curs!!!\\nLyn  : Was it valuable?\\nNinian : It was a keepsake from our departed mother.\\nNils : It was blessed by the spirit of Ninis... There\\'s no other like it in\\n   the world. And now we have lost it to those villains. There\\'s nothing we\\n   can do.\\nNinian : You\\'re right.\\nLyn  : ...\\n\\nLyn  : Can I talk to you, Agung? You heard all of that, right? What do you\\n   think? I\\'d realy love to retrieve Ninian\\'s ring for her. But if Nils is\\n   right, those thieves might prove to be too strong for us. What should we\\n   do?\\n\\nWhen you fulfill certain conditions, side quests may make themselves apparent\\nto you. Side quests allow you to learn things that aren\\'t part of the main\\nstory. You might meet tough new eneimes or find new companies to travel with.\\nHowever, side quests are very difficult, and once you begin one, you must see\\nit through to its end. If you plan to challlenge a side quest, I suggest you\\nkeep the save data from the previous mission. Not accepting side quests will\\nnot effect your ranking. If you\\'re in a hurry to pursue the main story, skip\\nthe side quests. Embark on side quest?\\n\\nChoose \"Yes\" to go to chapter 7X, \"No\" to go to chapter 8.\\n\\nYes choice :\\nLyn  : You want to help them? That\\'s great! I was hoping you\\'d say that,\\n   Agung. Kent! Sain! Those men were headed south. We must give pursuit!\\nSain : On your word, milady!\\nLyn  : There\\'s no turning back now. Let\\'s ride!\\n\\n\\nNo choice :\\nLyn  : I understand. That is the logical decision. If it had been up to me,\\n   I\\'d have ridden off and put us all in great danger. I\\'m glad you\\'re here\\n   to calm me down. Thank you. Let\\'s get moving! To Caelin!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.7X  CHAPTER SEVEN X : THE BLACK SHADOW\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA myserious group seems hell-bent on capturing Nils and Ninian... Having\\nfailed, this group, the Black Fang, flees. Rumor has them traveling\\nsouthwest. Lyn and her colleagues follow in hopes of recovering a lost\\nheirloom. The Black Fang have made a stronghold of an abandoned castle in\\nKhathelet. Its dark halls are alive with shadowy figures...\\n\\nGirl : So the brother escaped, and the sister was rescued by a band of\\n   strangers. Do I understand you?\\nBeyard : Yes... They ambushed us, and...\\nGirl : Hold your excuses. The end is all that matters.\\nBeyard : Yes, ma\\'am.\\nGirl : And your plan for recovering the siblings is?\\nBeyard : We\\'ve word that the entire group is headed this way, with the brats\\n   in tow.\\nGirl : They\\'re coming here? Why would they do that?\\nBeyard : They may well be after this ring.. It\\'s a rare piece. We took it\\n   from the girl. It was a stroke of luck that we did, especially if it\\n   brings them to us now. I\\'ll grab the whole lot of \\'em with this to bait\\n   the trap.\\nGirl : I see... Very well, I\\'ll give you another chance. I\\'ve business\\n   elsewhere, but I shall return once it\\'s finished. You have until sunrise\\n   tomorrow. Do you understand?\\nBeyard : Yes.\\nGirl : If you do not have the children when I return... my hand will deal you\\n   the fang\\'s punishment. Remember that. Bear it closely in your mind.\\nBeyard : ...\\n\\nLyn  : I believe they went in here.\\nNils : Milady, are you really going in there to get the ring back?\\nLyn  : Yes, we are.\\nNils : But this is their stronghold! They\\'re bound to be well defended, not to\\n   mention well armed!\\nNinian : Please forget about the ring. It\\'s OK...\\nLyn  : Agung\\'s agreed to attempt this... recovery. I wouldn\\'t be here if not\\n   for that. Agung believes we can do this. I\\'m sure that decision was not\\n   made lightly. With Agung at my side, I\\'m confident we can win. Let\\'s get\\n   your ring back, Ninian.\\nNils : Milady...\\nNinian : ...\\n\\nSain : Milady Lyndis! There are more of the foe inside than we thought.\\nLyn  : This is their stronghold. It\\'s imperative we move carefully.\\nKent : Exactly, milady. This narrow corridor can be used to our advantage. If\\n   we draw the enemy through here, we can engage them in small numbers and\\n   remain relatively safe. If time is a concern, we can always rush them...\\n   If we do that, we\\'d better be sure we can win.\\nLyn  : So, Agung. What do you think? How we move forward is completely up to\\n   you.\\n\\n\\nBeyard : How? This can\\'t be... They should be dead! Everyone! Get in there and\\n   finish them! This is our final chance!\\n\\nBeyard : I mustn\\'t fail... I cannot fail. The consequences are too--\\n\\nBeyard : Earghh...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBeyard : Aaah... No... I... I cannot...\\nLyn  : Give us the ring! And swear us this oath... You must promise to leave\\n   these two alone. If I have your vow, I\\'ll spare your life...\\nBeyard : Failure... means death...\\nLyn  : What?! Poison? He took his own life...\\nKent : These are no common brigands we\\'re dealing with. This man was trained\\n   by a well-organized group.\\nLyn  : What do they want with Nils and Ninian?\\nNils : ...\\nLyn  : Nils, Ninian. Everything\\'s going to be fine. As long as you\\'re with us,\\n   you\\'ll be safe.\\nNils : But...\\nLyn  : You witnessed our victory, right? With Agung\\'s planning and my sword,\\n   you\\'ve no worries. If we all work together, there\\'s nothing we can\\'t\\n   overcome. I don\\'t care who comes after you; I\\'ll not let you be taken.\\nNils : Really?\\nLyn  : Yes, on my honor. Right, Agung?\\nNinian : Milady...\\nLyn  : Oh, yes... This is yours.\\nNinian : Ah... It\\'s...\\nLyn  : You called it Ninis\\'s Grace, did you not? That lout had it.\\nNils : Milady Lyndis! Thank you so much!\\nNinian : I have no other words, save thank you.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.8  CHAPTER EIGHT : VORTEX OF STRATEGY\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPassing through Araphen and Khathelet, Lyn and her friends arrive in Caelin.\\nHowever, Caelin is now under the rule of Lord Lundgren. Lundgren\\'s henchmen\\nlay in wait to assassinate Lyn. They wait for her approach and ready a special\\nweapon.\\n\\nLyn  : Look, Agung! The mountains seem so far away now. We\\'ve come such a long\\n   way...\\nSain : Milady Lyndis! Agung! We can\\'t be very far from the castle now!\\nKent : By my reckoning, we can reach Castle Caelin in two days if we hurry.\\nLyn  : Two more days... Hold on, Grandfather. Please...\\nFlorina : Cheer up, Lyn. If they see you looking so sad, the entire company\\n   will lose heart.\\nLyn  : Florina... You\\'re right. There\\'s nothing to be gained by worrying. We\\n   just have to press onward.\\nFlorina : That\\'s the spirit!\\n\\nNils : Lyn... Danger approaches...\\nLyn  : What did you say?\\nSain : I don\\'t see anything. Are you sure?\\nNinian : I feel it, too. I\\'m sure of it. Ah! Milady, don\\'t move!\\nLyn  : Hm?\\n\\nLyn  : What in--Where did this bolt come from?\\nKent : They have a ballista!\\nSain : Lord Lundgren is getting serious. Deploying siege engines is no mean\\n   feat.\\nLyn  : What is a ballista?\\nKent : It\\'s a weapon designed for long-distance attacks. Only archers can use\\n   them, but they can be devastating.\\nSain : Florina! You must stay aground! Do not take to the air! The ballista\\n   would target you in an instant.\\nLyn  : Is there a way to combat it?\\nKent : The safest course is to use someone with good defence as bait, so the\\n   enemy wastes arrows.\\nSain : Then you can walk up and knock the fool on the head.\\n\\nLyn  : Wil, can you use a ballista?\\nWil  : I\\'ve never tried, but... It\\'s just a really big bow, right? I should be\\n   able to figure it out.\\nLyn  : All we can ask is that you try... Let\\'s see what we can do!\\n\\nMatthew : Ah, Lady Lyndis! Agung! I have some minor... business... to attend\\n   to. I\\'m unable to join you. If you need any of my possessions, please take\\n   them now.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOn the far side of the hill to the south is a ballista. As Kent said, it\\'s a\\nweapon intended for trained archers. The attack range of ballista is\\nextremely large, so they can fire on enemies at great distances. As they can\\nattack without fear of counterattack, they\\'re quite useful. To use one, move\\nan archer onto an unoccupied ballista, and select the ride command. After\\nthat, you can attack as usual. Ballistae can also be moved while in use.\\nAdditionally, ballistae can be used by an archer in the field. So, if you can\\nremove the enemy manning the ballista and move of your group onto it...\\nyou\\'ll find it most useful.\\n\\nVillage (14,15)\\nNPC  : Do you remember the weapon triangle? Axes over lances and whatnot?\\n   This is important, so pay attention. There are some weapons that don\\'t\\n   follow the normal rules. This here lancereaver is one of those. It\\'s a\\n   sword that reverses the triangle. So if you wield this blade, you can\\n   best a lance with it. Of course, there\\'s a downside... Axes can best this\\n   sword. Take this as a gift. It\\'s your reward for listening to an old man\\n   ramble. Don\\'t be so shy. It\\'s not like I can use the thing. Not everyone\\n   can wield a sword of this caliber. I\\'m sure you know someone who can use\\n   it, though.\\n\\nYogi : What are you curs waiting for? They\\'re nothing but fleas! Call up for\\n   reinforcements,and rush \\'em!\\n\\nYogi : Curses! The ballista must have been taken... What\\'s going on here!?\\n   Somebody, get that girl!\\n\\nYogi : Lord Lundgren... I\\'ve failed you... I pray you hurry... with those\\n   reinforcements... you promised.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : Is it over?\\nKent : Yes. I see no more enemy soldiers. However, something is bothering me.\\nLyn  : What is it?\\nKent : I noticed it during the fighting. Our opponents... They were soldiers\\n   of Caelin. I even recognized some of those we fought. I trained with many\\n   of them... And yet they attacked us without hesitation.\\nSain : They\\'re black-hearted traitors who\\'ve joined Lord Lundgren. Good\\n   riddance, I say. It also means less resistance at the castle.\\nKent : I hope you\\'re right...\\nLyn  : I\\'m just glad Nils and Ninian were with us. If that first shot had hit\\n   me, I might not have survived.\\nNinian : We are honored to have served you well.\\nNils : We won\\'t let you down!\\nLyn  : I know. I\\'m relying on you.\\nMatthew : What\\'s this? You dealt with the ballista, too? Nicely done!\\nLyn  : Matthew, where were you during all this?\\nMatthew : I went to the village to sniff about for information. I got some\\n   interesting news for my trouble, too.\\nLyn  : Let\\'s hear it!\\nMatthew : First, about Marquess Caelin\\'s illness. He really is unwell. He\\'s\\n   been abed for nigh on three months.\\nLyn  : Oh, no... Grandfather...\\nMatthew : I heard an interesting rumor about his condition, though. The people\\n   believe that someone\\'s been poisoning the marquess...\\nLyn  : He\\'s being poisoned!?\\nMatthew : And this someone... Well, everyone\\'s too afraid to mention a name.\\n   However,they say that, as soon as the marquess took ill, a certain noble\\n   took control of the castle as though it were his own. I fed a hungry\\n   innkeeper some coin, and he fed me a name. The marquess of Caelin\\'s own\\n   brother, Lord Lundgren.\\nLyn  : How can this be? How can they allow him to get away with this? The\\n   villagers know he\\'s the one poisoning my grandfather, and yet no one raises\\n   a hand against him? Why?\\nKent : They are afraid, and they lack proof. The whisperings of the common\\n   people means nothing.\\nMatthew : That\\'s the truth of it. And of the marquess\\'s loyal retainers who\\n   might have lent credence to these rumors, there is no sign.\\nLyn  : Are you saying they\\'ve been silenced?\\nMatthew : It\\'s a fair assumption.\\nKent : This is beyond believing.\\nMatthew : The worst news is yet to come.\\nSain : What? There\\'s more?\\nMatthew : An imposter\\'s appeared, claiming to be the marquess\\'s granddaughter.\\n   At least, that\\'s the story Lundgren\\'s telling to all who\\'ll listen.\\nLyn  : What does that mean?\\nMatthew : It means that people are waiting for two traitorous knights and a\\n   baseborn child to appear and lay calim to Castle Caelin.\\nSain : But... But that... It can\\'t be!\\nKent : Traitors? Us? Ridiculous!!!\\nLyn  : He says... I\\'m an imposter?\\nMatthew : Don\\'t you have anything that proves your lineage?\\nLyn  : When my mother joined the Lorca, she brought nothing of Lycia with her.\\nSain : Milady, Marquess Araphen himself remarked at your resemblance to Lady\\n   Madelyn! Your face is your proof!\\nKent : They\\'ll say we found a look-alike somewhere... We\\'re seen as betrayers\\n   of our knightly vows. Our word means nothing. No, our only hope is to see\\n   Marquess Caelin himself.\\nLyn  : We must hurry. If not, my grandfather... I must see him!. With my last\\n   breath if need be.\\nMatthew : But we must formulate some manner of plan! Even if we set out for\\n   the castle, the troops patrolling the area will cause no end of problems.\\n   You have been branded as oathbreakers, after all.\\nLyn  : I\\'ve got it! Eliwood... He seemed sympathetic to our plight. He should\\n   be still in Kathelet. If we can talk to him, he might help us!\\nKent : Of course! A sound idea!\\nSain : Let\\'s hurry!\\nLyn  : Yes! Back to Kathelet!!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.9  CHAPTER NINE : A GRIM REUNION\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn and her friends have been branded as traitors, pretenders to the throne.\\nLundgren has sent word to Caelin\\'s neighbors, warning them of Lyn\\'s approach.\\nHe calls for reinforcements to put an end to the \"imposter\". If the other\\nrealms of Lycia choose to act, Lyn will never reach Caelin alive. Lyn places\\nher faith in Eliwood and waits.\\n\\nEliwood : I\\'ve received word from Caelin\\'s neighbors, Laus, Tuscana, Kathelet,\\n   Tania, and Santaruz. They will not interfere in Caelin\\'s affairs. This they\\n   have promised.\\nLyn  : Eliwood, I don\\'t know how to thank you...\\nEliwood : All I\\'ve done is convince them to remain neutral in this dispute.\\n   However, this means I cannot aid you in any way either. Will you be all\\n   right?\\nLyn  : I will win. I have to. It\\'s the only way that I can help my\\n   grandfather.\\nEliwood : I understand. Although I cannot help you directly, as a friend, I\\n   pray for your success.\\nLyn  : Thank you. I won\\'t waste the opportunity you\\'ve given me.\\n\\nLyn  : All right, everyone! Let\\'s get going!!\\nSain : This weather is turning foul. It looks like a fog is rolling in.\\nKent : This is no good. If the fog thickens, we\\'ll be blind in battle. It will\\n   be difficult to fight what we cannot see.\\nLyn  : We can\\'t let it delay us, though. Let us press on. We must get closer\\n   to the castle. What\\'s the best route?\\nKent : Let me think... Our best path is to the south... However, that runs\\n   through General Eagler\\'s estate. It looks like we still have one final\\n   obstacle to pass.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMatthew : Agung, put me in the lead, please. Surely you know that we... er...\\n   thieves, if you must, can see through fog. Follow me, everyone!\\nWallace : So you\\'ve come...\\nSain : Aah!\\nKent : You! You\\'re... Lord Wallace!\\nLyn  : Kent, who is this?\\nKent : He used to be the commander of the knights of Caelin.\\nSain : Aren\\'t you supposed to be retired? I heard you were sowing fields now.\\nWallace : I am, and I was. Then I received orders from Lord Lundgren. I was\\n   told to capture an imposter and a pair of rogues knights.\\nKent : Lord Wallace! Surely, you don\\'t believe us to be oathbreakers, do you?\\nWallace : Bring me the girl that claims to be Lady Madelyn\\'s child.\\nSain : What are your intentions?\\nWallace : If I don\\'t like what I see, I will take her.\\nKent : We will prevent you.\\nWallace : You? Prevent me? You must be--\\nLyn  : Enough! I\\'m right here! I am Lyndis.\\nWallace : Ah...\\nLyn  : I\\'ll understand if you don\\'t believe me. But I\\'ve had enough of you\\n   and your foolish posturing!\\nWallace : Hmm... Such beautiful eyes...\\nLyn  : Pardon?\\nWallace : I\\'ve been a knight for 30 years, and there is one thing I learned.\\n   A person with eyes as bright and true as yours is no deceiver. Ha ha ha ha\\n   ha ha! Ah, yes! I like you, girl! Why, I believe I\\'ll even join your little\\n   band of mercenaries!\\nSain : Are you... Are you serious?\\nWallace : This old bull\\'s pledged his loyalty to Caelin. I would never allow\\n   an usurper on the throne. Let\\'s march!\\nKent : Lord Wallace! He... He hasn\\'t changed at all.\\nLyn  : I like him. He\\'s... honest.\\nKent : That he is. He deserves our respect.\\n\\nWallace : I\\'d planned on living out my days in peace on my farm... Ah, well...\\n   It looks as though it\\'s time to take up arms once more. Agung! You\\'re the\\n   tactician of this group, correct? What are my orders?\\n\\nWallace is a level 12 knight. He can rise as high as level 20. Most units can\\nchange classes once they reach level 10. By changing classes, units can\\nimprove all of their abilities. Movement range, constituion, usable weapons...\\nEverything. There are many benefits. With a single action, you can make your\\nunits significantly more powerful. In order to change classes, units need to\\nbe of a certain level. However, you also need a special item. For example,\\nWallace is carrying a knight crest. With this, cavaliers and knights can\\nchange classes. Each character class has its own unique item that allows units\\nof that class to switch to a different class. Well then, why don\\'t we try\\nchanging classes now? Select Wallace, then choose knight crest from his items\\nand use it.\\n\\nWallace : Ha ha haaaa! So you\\'ve noticed my knight crest, have you? You\\'ve\\n   eyes like an eagle, my friend! Once I\\'ve used the crest, I\\'ll be even\\n   stronger! A terrifying thought, isn\\'t it? Ha ha haaaa! What are you waiting\\n   for? Order me to use the knight crest!!!\\n\\nWallace : Ha ha ha haaa! Look! a giant walks among you!! My defense is\\n  impenetrable! Come! Break your weapons against me!\\n\\n\\nVillage (2,10)\\nNPC  : Hey, you... Do you have any torches? What? You don\\'t? There\\'s a thick\\n   fog rolling in, and you have NO torches? Wandering about without a torch\\n   is... Well, it\\'s ridiculous! Here. Take one of mine. Use this when it\\'s\\n   foggy, and you can see a bit better. Hm? No, no need for thanks. I know all\\n   about you and your comrades. We all, well... Not one of us believes what\\n   Lord Lundgren is saying about you. We all want to help the marquess... and\\n   his rightful heir. Good luck!\\n\\n\\nLyn  : Agung... The fog\\'s rolling in. We can\\'t hit an enemy we can\\'t see.\\n   Keep your eyes open, everyone!\\n\\n\\nEagler : Bring forth the imposter who calls herself \"Lyndis\"! She shall not\\n   pass beyond this place!\\nLyn  : I am Lyndis. I\\'m no pretender. I\\'d ask you to believe me, but your\\n   heart and mind seem set.\\nEagler : Enough talk... Draw your sword!\\n\\nSain : General Eagler...\\nEagler : Sain... I never imagined you could turn traitor...\\nSain : Who\\'s the traitor here? I am following the orders of my sworn liege\\n   lord. Not Lundgren, but my true liege, the marquess himself!\\nEagler : You speak with conviction. I think it\\'s time to tes the bounds of\\n   your loyalty!\\n\\nEagler : Kent! Is that you?\\nKent : General Eagler! We found Lady Lyndis on the orders of the marquess. We\\n   have worked so very hard to return her safely to Caelin.\\nEagler : And yet you have no proof of the girl\\'s identity. Is that not true?\\nKent : Yes, but...\\nEagler : Then our talk is finished! Draw your weapon and come!\\n\\nEagler : Imposters to the throne, you shall not pass! No quarters for\\n   traitors!\\n\\nWallace : Eagler!\\nEagler : General Wallace... So you have sided with the girl, too!\\nWallace : I fight for Caelin\\'s honor, not for Lundgren\\'s lies!\\nEagler : Ah... Is that so? You are-- Enough! There\\'s nothing more to be said.\\n   I name you traitors all! Come! Do your worst!\\nWallace : Fool... At the very least, let mine be the blow that finishes you!\\n\\n\\nEagler : Nnng... Go... Go quickly. The marquess... he knows nothing of this...\\n   His life is... There\\'s no illness. Only... poison... Please... for the\\n   marquess... for all of Caelin...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : What kind of man was General Eagler?\\nKent : When Sain and I first became knights, he was our captain. Our\\n   teacher...\\nLyn  : I think he must have known we were telling the truth. Why did he force\\n   the fight?\\nSain : Something must have... Lord Lundgren was exerting some hold on him...\\n   Eagler was trying to protect someone. A friend perhaps, or family.\\nKent : ...\\nLyn  : May Lundgren never know the peaceful embrace of Mother Earth! I care\\n   not what others do. I WILL stop that man! Agung! The final battle is\\n   approaching!\\n\\nCastle Caelin\\nLundgren : How are you feeling today, my dear brother?\\nMarquess : Lundgren... You... You fiend...\\nLundgren : Your granddaughter is dead by now. And soon, you will join her.\\nMarquess : Lyndis... Why did this happen? I... I only wanted to see her once.\\nLundgren : Have you lost all hope? Has your life lost all meaning? Then hurry\\n   up and die, you miserable old dotard! You and your precious granddaughter\\n   are in my way!!! I curse your name! I despise you! My worthless wretch of\\n   a brother!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.10  CHAPTER TEN : THE DISTANT PLAINS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGeneral Eagler has been defeated. Lyn and her band draw ever nearer to Castle\\nCaelin. Within the castle walls, Lyn\\'s bitter enemy, Lundgren, awaits... A man\\nwho would kill his own kin for a throne. He is the source of all her troubles.\\nHe must be stopped.\\n\\nKent : Lady Lyndis, you should be able to see Castle Caelin once we pass these\\n   mountains.\\nLyn  : Grandfather... I\\'ll be with you soon.\\nKent : Everything rests on this next battle.\\nSain : Lundgren will not be receiving the reinforcements he expected. He\\'ll\\n   move against us with everything he has soon.\\nLyn  : Let him come! Let them all come! I will not be turned away! I will see\\n   my grandfather... I\\'ve coe too far to let anyone stand in my way. This is\\n   it, Agung. This is our final test. My friends, for one last time, lend me\\n   your strength!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : Those clouds look bad. It\\'s going to rain soon. Let\\'s go, Agung. We\\n   should press on while we\\'re still able.\\n\\nLyn  : Look! The clouds are breaking. This rain should stop soon...\\n\\nHouse (4,17)\\nNPC  : Oh,no! If I don\\'t bring in the laundry now... Oh, hello. Are you a\\n   soldier? Sounds like a hard life... Especially when it rains. Rain must\\n   make it difficult for you to move around. I used to ride horses when I was\\n   little. Oh, I remember how those horses disliked the rain. It\\'s better to\\n   be on foot when it\\'s wet. Nomadic horses are trained on the plains, so\\n   they\\'re better with rain, but... Well rain just seems to make it hard for\\n   everyone to get around. The weather around here can change in no time at\\n   all. I recommend just staying in one place until the rain clears up.\\n\\nHouse (17,16)\\nNPC  : You\\'re here to fight Lundgren, aren\\'t you? Do you have enough weapons?\\n   Lundgren\\'s no ordinary knight: he\\'s a general. Iron weapons lack the edge\\n   to penetrate his armor. If you need something, visit my father\\'s armory.\\n   You should go to the shop next door to his, too. They\\'ve many powerful\\n   weapons and items you can use against Lundgren. Head south and cross the\\n   river. You\\'ll see them. Lundgren\\'s a tricky one. He\\'s destroyed the bridge.\\n   There\\'s an old snag next to the river, though... If you knocked it over,\\n   you should be able to cross. Travel well. You fight for us all.\\n\\nVillage (16,6)\\nNPC  : You\\'ve finally made it her, have you? Such a long way... We\\'re all\\n   behind Lady Lyndis. All of us. Here, take this. Use it in your battle\\n   against Lundgren, please. It\\'s an energy ring. It\\'ll increase your strength\\n   and magic power a bit. There are lots of items that augment your abilities.\\n   These are hard to come by, so think carefully before you use them. Of\\n   course, not using them at all would be a terrible waste as well, right?\\n   Items like this might vanish once you\\'ve used them. Bear that in mind, and\\n   use them wisely.\\n\\nHouse (14,2)\\nNPC  : You know, you really should visit ther armory next door. They\\'ve got\\n   all you need if you\\'re fighting knights and generals. You need something\\n   to defeat Lundgren, right? Once he\\'s been beaten, maybe peace will return\\n   to Caelin. Good luck to you!\\n\\nLundgren : This is my realm, and you\\'ve entered without my permission. You\\n   will not leave these lands alive!\\n\\nLundgren : That annoying little girl... Nothing but a savage from Sacae...\\n   The Caelin throne... should be... mine...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : We\\'ve won... At last, I can see my grandfather.\\nReissmann : You are Lady Lyndis, are you not?\\nLyn  : Who are you?\\nReissmann : I am Reissmann, the chancellor of the Caelin royal family. I had\\n   received word from Kent and Sain when you first met, but the Lundgren\\n   discovered the message and imprisoned me. It is my great pleasure to\\n   welcome you to your true home.\\nLyn  : Thank you. May I see my grandfather now?\\nReissmann : Yes, of course. Do not be shocked by what you see. Lundgren has\\n   been poisoning the marquess\\'s meals for some time. His body has been\\n   ravaged... He\\'s been bedridden for months.\\nHausen : Who is there? I said no visitors. I will see no one.\\nLyn  : .....\\nHausen : What are you doing? Leave me... to die...\\nLyn  : Um... Pardon me... My name is... I\\'m Lyndis.\\nHausen : Eh? Did you say Lyndis? Is that...\\nLyn  : My father\\'s name was Hassar, chieftain of the Lorca. My mother was...\\n   Madelyn. I was raised on the plains.\\nHausen : ... Could it be? Come, come here. Let me see your face. Oh...\\n   Yes... There is no doubt... You are Madelyn\\'s trueborn child... Uhhh...\\n   ahhh...\\nLyn  : Grandfather!\\n\\nHausen : Lundgren told me that my daugther had died. My heir... and you,\\n   too. He told me you were dead. Thank you... Thank you for living. Aahhh...\\n   I am blessed...\\nLyn  : Mother and Father were slain last year by brigands. I... I was the only\\n   survivor. I lived on, but...\\nHausen : Lyndis, please forgive a prideful old man. If I had but accepted\\n   your parent\\'s love... There would have been no bandits. We would have lived\\n   here together in perfect peace.\\nLyn  : Grandfather. My parents... My tribe... Our life was one of love and\\n   peace. The end was tragic, but... up until the attack, we were truly\\n   hapy.\\nHausen : Truyly ? Madelyn had a life of happiness? Knowing that gives me so\\n   much joy. Thank you, Lyndis. I can die in peace now...\\nLyn  : No! Grandfather! You musn\\'t say that!\\nHausen : There\\'s no avoiding it, Lyndis. I\\'ve taken too much poison for far\\n   too long. It\\'s too late...\\nLyn  : Be brave, Grandfather! You will recover! Believe me! On the plains, we\\n   say that illness fails in the face of a strong heart! I am with you now!\\n   You mustn\\'t give up!\\nHausen : You\\'re... with me...\\nLyn  : Yes. We have so much to talk about. Walks to take, music to listen to.\\n   There\\'s so much I want to do with you, so much lost time we can recover!\\nHausen : That does sound... nice.\\nLyn  : Doesn\\'t it? And once you\\'re well, I\\'ll take you to the plains. I\\'ll\\n   show you the endless sky, the oceans of grass... I want you to know the\\n   lands my mother loved so much!\\nHausen : The lands Madelyn loved... You\\'re right. I still have... quite a bit\\n   of living to do.\\nLyn  : You can do it, Grandfather!\\nHausen : Lyndis...\\n\\nSain : Lady Lyndis! Do you honestly plan on remaining here? Tell me truly!\\nLyn  : Yes, until my grandfather is well. I can\\'t leave him now. I won\\'t.\\nKent : The physician says that Lord Hausen looks like a new man. It\\'s like\\n   he was never ill. And it\\'s all thanks to you, milady.\\nLyn  : He\\'s the only family I have left. I want him to have a long life.\\nFlorina : Lady Lyndis!\\nLyn  : What is it, Florina?\\nFlorina : I\\'ve been taken into service by House Caelin! From here on, Lyn...\\n   I mean, Lady Lyndis... We\\'ll be together always!\\nLyn  : Really? Oh, that pleases me so... but... Please don\\'t call me Lady\\n   Lyndis. For you, I\\'m still just Lyn.\\nFlorina : My pegasus and I fly for your house now. I am your servant. There\\n   are rules to follow.\\nLyn  : Florina!\\nFlorina : I\\'m happiest when I\\'m with you. That\\'s more important than how I\\n   address you... Please...\\nLyn  : I suppose I\\'ll just have to get used to it, right? Very well, I\\n   understand.\\nFlorina : Oh, thank you! I do love you, Lyn! Oops! I mean... Lady Lyndis!\\nLyn  : Ha ha ha... Oh, Florina!\\nWil  : Lady Lyndis! I\\'ve decided to stay, too!\\nLyn  : Wil? Weren\\'t you planning on returning home?\\nWil  : Well, I was, but... I\\'ve grown quite fond of Lyndis\\'s Legions, you\\n   know... I couldn\\'t possibly leave everyone behind. I\\'ll send word to my\\n   family regarding my decision.\\nLyn  : I\\'m pleased to have you, Wil. Thank you.\\nWil  : Thank you, milady.\\n\\nLyn  : Agung... you\\'re leaving, aren\\'t you? No, I\\'m not asking you to stay.\\n   It\\'s just... I\\'ll miss you. When I found you unconscious on the plains...\\n   I had no idea we would be together for so long. You\\'ve helped us so much,\\n   and I\\'m sure you\\'ve learned all you can from us. You\\'ll do just fine on\\n   your own. I have the utmost faith that you\\'ll be a master tactician, Agung.\\n   That\\'s from someone who\\'s seen you at work!\\nLyn  : Well then, take care... I... I hope I see you again. I\\'m sure that I\\n   will someday...\\n\\nKent, Knight of Lycia\\nFor his bravery in fulfilling his command, Kent is named Knight Commander of\\nCaelin.

Mankind vanquished\\nthe dragons thanks to the efforts of eight heroes. These eight mighty generals\\nbrought peace to Elibe.

Thank you, Marcus.\\n\\nEliwood : Mother, it\\'s time for us to go.\\nEleanora : Eliwood... Promise that you will return to me safely. I\\'m worried\\n   about your father, but... If anything were to happen to you... My heart\\n   could not bear that sorrow.\\nEliwood : I know, Mother. Please do not worry. Father is alive, I know it.\\n   I vow that I will find him and return him to your side.\\nEleanora : I have your word then.\\nEliwood : Yes, of course. Isadora, I entrust my mother to you in my absence.\\nIsadora : Yes, milord. I will guard over her well.\\nEliwood : Mother, I will return. Rest easy.\\n\\nEliwood : Well, Marcus, it looks like it\\'s just the two of us.\\nMarcus : Not so, milord. My man Lowen will be traveling with us.\\nEliwood : Lowen? That\\'s reassuring.\\nMarcus : I\\'ve sent him ahead to the village. He hopes to seek out a few able\\n   men who are skilled at arms. Normally, I wouldn\\'t venture forth without a\\n   larger company, but... I bow to your will on this matter, Lord Eliwood.\\nEliwood : I\\'m sorry, Marcus, but I would rather not deprive my mother of even\\n   a single guard. The best knights in the realm disappeared with my father.\\n   If anything were to happen to my mother while I am gone, I...\\nMarcus : I understand, milord. Hmph! What\\'s keeping Lowen!?\\n\\nGroznyi : We\\'ve all heard that the knights of Pherae have vanished, right?\\n   Well, your misfortune is my good luck! I have an announcement to make! As\\n   of now, this village is mine! Groznyi is your new liege! Now, bring every\\n   last piece of gold, down to the smallest fleck!\\nLowen : Lord Eliwood! Co-Commander Marcus! I...\\nMarcus : Lowen! Calm yourself! A knight must be in control at all times.\\nLowen : The village is under attack! It\\'s bandits!\\nMarcus : What? Bandits? Here!?\\nEliwood : Are you sure, Lowen?\\nLowen : This girl has more details.\\nRebecca : My lord Eliwood? I\\'m the daughter of the village magistrate. My\\n   name\\'s Rebecca. The bandits came without warning. They\\'re stealing\\n   everything! I beg you! Please help us!\\nEliwood : I see. Marcus! Lowen! We must aid the village!\\nLowen : Yes, milord!\\nEliwood : Rebecca, stay here, and keep out of sight.\\nRebecca : If it please you, milord, I would rather fight. I hunt almost every\\n   day, and I have some skill with a bow.\\nEliwood : Is that so? Very well, but be careful!\\nRebecca : Yes, milord.\\n\\nLowen : Lord Eliwood, one more thing. There is another in the village who has\\n   offered to help. A traveling tactician who was staying at the inn.\\nEliwood : A tactician?\\nLowen : Yes, milord. This is Agung.\\nEliwood : Agung!\\nLowen : Do you know this person, milord?\\nEliwood : Yes, I met Agung during the trouble in Caelin last year. A fantastic\\n   military advisor, if memory serves. If not for Agung, the marquess of\\n   Caelin and his granddaughter, Lyn, might not have survived Lundgren\\'s\\n   uprising. What brings you to Pherae, my friend? Ha! Still traveling about,\\n   honing your skills? Of course... A worthy pursuit. Let\\'s give thanks to\\n   providence for our chance reunion. We have need of your aid. Please lend\\n   us your skill.\\n\\nBartre : Look, Dorcas! Can you believe it? It\\'s just like that knight said!\\n   That\\'s Lord Eliwood!\\nDorcas : So it seems.\\nBartre : What\\'s he doing? Hey, he\\'s taking on those bandits. Protecting\\n   innocents? That\\'s a right lordly thing to do, isn\\'t it? Right, Dorcas?\\nDorcas : You talk too much. The lordling needs our help.\\nBartre : Right! Leave these mountain weaklings to me! I\\'m Bartre the Brave!\\n\\nVillage (17,10)\\nNPC  : Is Lord Elber well? We\\'ve heard nothing but foul rumors hereabouts...\\n   All of Pherae is worried for his well-being. We hear tell that Lord\\n   Eliwood is going to find the marquess. This dragon shield is our village\\n   treasure... It boosts the defences of the one who uses it. Take it please.\\n   And may it see you and Lord Elbert home safely.\\n\\nHouse (11,10)\\nNPC  : You\\'ve got some skill with weapons, but do you understand weapon\\n   levels? The more you use a weapon, the more skilled you become. Still, you\\n   can only reach the highest level with a single weapon... But to look at\\n   you, I think it\\'ll be a while before that happens.\\n\\nHose (10,10)\\nNPC  : There\\'s a young traveler been stayin\\' with the magistrate. Been staying\\n   in the village for a few days now. I know, you\\'re thinkin\\' it\\'s just\\n   another good-for-nothing courtier lookin\\' for a handout. But there\\'s\\n   somethin\\' more to this one... Those eyes... They miss nothing. Got a\\n   mission, that one has.\\n\\nGroznyi : What is this, a pack of children coming to play? You think you can\\n   challenge me? What? Pheraen knights!? But that\\'s impossible!!!\\n\\nGroznyi : Ugh...

Our deepest thanks for coming\\n   to the aid of our fair village.\\nEliwood : Think nothing of it. It\\'s a lord\\'s duty to protect the citizenry.\\nMagistrate : Would that were true, milord. The good folk of Laus know no such\\n   protection. Their marquess, Lord Darin, is too busy preparing for war. He\\n   ignores all complaints of bandits and thieves.\\nEliwood : Preparing for war? Are you sure?\\nMagistrate : I would not lie, milord. My brother lived in Laus until a few\\n   days ago. His home was torched, and he had no choice but to flee here.\\n   According to him, Laus could go to war any day now. It\\'s all the people of\\n   Laus are talking about.\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, if this is true, the situation is a grave one. If\\n   Marquess Laus is readying for war... His target is most likely another\\n   Lycian territory. Perhaps this is connected to Lord Elbert\\'s disappearance.\\nEliwood : My father and Marquess Laus? It seems a tenuous connection, but it\\'s\\n   as good a start as any. Let us travel to Laus. We must learn more.\\n\\nEliwood : Thank you for your guidance, Agung. Where are you bound for next?\\n   If you have no destination in mind, perhaps you could travel with us. OUrs\\n   is a small group, with a single purpose-- to find my father. I do not know\\n   where our road will lead, but... We would be stronger with you in our\\n   company.\\nEliwood : You will travel with us? Splendid! Thank you! I pray we give you no\\n   cause to regret your decision.\\n\\nMagistrate : Rebecca! Where do you think you\\'re going, young lady?\\nRebecca : Father, I... I intend to accompany Lord Eliwood.\\nMagistrate : Don\\'t be ridiculous, girl! Lord Eliwood is not going on a picnic.\\n   He\\'s riding into danger.\\nRebecca : I know that, Father. That\\'s why I want to go. We owe him our lives,\\n   and I want to repay him. My bow may not be all that much, but I know I can\\n   be of service!\\nMagistrate : But...\\nRebecca : And, Father... I may meet up with my brother somewhere. You\\'re the\\n   magistrate-- you have responsibilities. I... This is all I can offer. I\\n   need to do this! Please, Father! Let me go!\\nMagistrate : Dear me... You\\'re just as stubborn as your mother was.\\nRebecca : I\\'m sorry, Father...\\nMagistrate : You must bow to Lord Eliwood\\'s wishes on this matter. If he\\n   consents, you may go.\\nRebecca : Thank you, Father!\\nMagistrate : Lord Elbert has always been kind of us. Follow his son with a\\n   true heart, Rebecca. Serve Lord Eliwood well, as I have served his father.\\nRebecca : I will, Father!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.12  CHAPTER TWELVE : BIRDS OF A FEATHER\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter speaking with the village magistrate, Eliwood and company set their\\nsights on Laus. The road from Pherae to Laus passes trough Santaruz. Eliwood\\nsuspects his missing father must have visited Santaruz en route to Ostia.\\nEliwood arranges a meeting with the local ruling lord to see what he can\\nlearn.\\n\\nSantaruz Castle\\nHelman : What? Eliwood is here?\\nEphidel : Yes, He has set camp up on a hill south of here. He seeks\\n   permission to enter Santaruz. He seeks an audience with you.\\nHelman : Could it be... Do you think Eliwood\\'s come to ask of his father?\\n   If that\\'s the case... I... I know not what to tell him.\\nEphidel : Tell him you know nothing, and let him be on his way.\\nHelman : Yet... I know young Eliwood well. His father, Elbert, and I are old\\n   friends. I\\'ve no children of my own, and I\\'ve always treasured Eliwood. I\\n   do not believe I could look him in the eye and... I could not lie to him.\\n   I could not.\\nEphidel : We\\'ve no choice then. Let us chase the boy away. If you do not\\n   speak with him, you need tell no lies.\\nHelman : Wait! Do you mean to harm Eliwood?\\nEphidel : Not harm. Frighten. A scratch or two will leave no scars. He will\\n   run home to Pherae and be done with his adventure. He is, after all, all\\n   that Pherae has left...\\nHelman : ...\\n\\nMarcus : Instead of entering Laus with such a small group, we should meet\\n   with Marquess Santaruz and request his assistance... I see the sense in\\n   that. It\\'s a good plan, Agung.\\nEliwood : Truly so. I tell you again, I\\'m pleased to have you with us. Lord\\n   Helman... He\\'s not only my father\\'s friend. I\\'ve known him since I was a\\n   child. I\\'m sure that he will help us.\\nMarcus : What? Lord Eliwood! Beware!\\nZagan : Heh heh heh... Noble sires, Alms for a poor villager.\\nMarcus : Poor villager? You look nothing like an honest man. Clear the road.\\n   Step quickly or...\\nZagan : Step quickly? Heh heh... Good advice. Maybe it\\'s you who should follow\\n   it!\\nMarcus : What?\\nZagan : Someone wants the boy in an early grave. A shame if you ask me, but\\n   he\\'ll die here today. C\\'mon, boys! Earn your keep!\\n\\nDorcas : Here we go again, eh, Agung? Just like old times... Seems our fates\\n   are bound. Natalie? Oh, she\\'s still in Pherae. I\\'m working or you this\\n   time, so she\\'s not too worried. Guide my axe, Agung.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nVillage (2,8)\\nNPC  : Hmm... You look like you\\'ve some experience with battle. No need to\\n   conceal it. I\\'ve fought in many a battle in my time, I assure you. Let me\\n   tell you one thing about combat, though. The most important thing is\\n   technique. If you\\'ve no skill, you\\'ll rearely strike your enemy. My\\n   instructor gave me this secret book long ago. It will improve the fighting\\n   prowess of the one who reads it. I\\'m too old to make use of it, so why\\n   don\\'t you take it?\\n\\nHouse (1,3)\\nNPC  : I saw them, I did. About a month ago... Marquess Pherae and his men\\n   passed right through here. They\\'ve all gone missing, haven\\'t they? A group\\n   as strong as that just up and vanishing... Couldn\\'t have been bandits,\\n   but... I don\\'t believe it. Must\\'ve been something terrible. The world\\'s\\n   become a dangerous place, it has.\\n\\nHouse (8,1)\\nNPC  : It\\'s really important to trust your companions, yes? If you have a boon\\n   companion fighting at your side, you feel stronger and more confident.\\n   Hm? Who do I think make good companions for whom? Well, I am a fortune-\\n   teller, so I could do a reading, but...\\n\\nHouse (8,12)\\nNPC  : The marquess who leads Santaruz is Lord Helman. He doesn\\'t aks for\\n   much, and he\\'s a nice enough fellow. I wouldn\\'t call him weak, but he is\\n   more follower than leader. Lately, he\\'s been meeting with Marquess Laus\\n   quite a lot. I hope nothing bad comes of it, but...\\n\\n\\nZagan : Bah! He puts up a good fight for a pampered noble pup. It\\'s up to me\\n   to finish him.\\n\\nEliwood : How many are there? This looks ---\\n\\nHector : Hey! What\\'s going on over there? Looks like some rough business. You!\\n   Soldier! Are you just going to stand there watch?\\nSoldier : Who do you think you are? This is Santaruz. What occurs here is no\\n   affair of any foreign lordling!\\nHector : I believe I\\'m going to have to disagree with you. You see, the man\\n   they\\'re attacking happens to be a friend of mine.\\nSoldier : A friend? What? ...Urrrgh!!\\nHector : Sorry, but I\\'m in a hurry.\\nSerra : Ewww! That\\'s terrible! I loathe violence!\\nMatthew : Nicely done, my lord! You\\'re a fighter born.\\nOswin : I cannot condone resorting to force so quickly...\\nHector : Chastise me later, Oswin. First, we deal with these brigands! Come!\\n   We must help Eliwood!\\nOswin : Help Eliwood? Sounds like a convenient excuse for more violence.\\nHector : Oswin!\\nOswin : yes, yes. I\\'m coming!\\nHector : Matthew! Take Serra and find someplace to hide.\\nMatthew : What? With... Serra?\\nSerra : No! I\\'m going with you!\\nHector : You are not! You\\'ll slow us down!\\nSerra : Oh! How rude!\\nHector : Oswin! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nZagan : Curses! What are you waiting for!? Let me show you boys how it\\'s done!\\n\\nZagan : Oh... aaurr... This... was not... so easy... as it seemed...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHector : Whew... Is that all of them?\\nEliwood : Hector! Where did you come from?\\nHector : Well met, Eliwood.\\nEliwood : Yes, but... what are you doing here?\\nHector : You wound me!\\nEliwood : How do you mean?\\nHector : You\\'re looking for your father, right? Why didn\\'t you send word?\\nEliwood : Your brother was just named Marquess Ostia. He\\'s going to be very\\n   busy setting up his court council. Lord Uther must need your support. You\\n   are his brother, after all.\\nHector : My brother is not so weak. Oh, he has mentioned some things in\\n   public, but... He knew exactly what I was planning, and he let me go.\\nEliwood : Is that so? Well then, it would be unwise to refuse his kindness!\\n   It does me good to see you, Hector. Thank you.\\nHector : Think nothing of it. You know Oswin, don\\'t you?\\nOswin : Well met, Lord Eliwood.\\nEliwood : It is good to see you again, oswin. So you came as well?\\nOswin : Yes. Lord Uther was worried about Lord Hector traveling alone. I\\'ve\\n   been ordered to keep a close eye on him.\\nEliwood : Ha ha ha! Of course! Good to have you with us.\\nSerra : Lord Hector! Why didn\\'t you tell me the fighting was done!?\\nMatthew : I apologize for the interruption. I couldn\\'t restrain her any\\n   longer!\\nEliwood : Are these your companions, Hector?\\nHector : Oh... Yes, I suppose they are. One might have hoped for better,\\n   but...\\nSerra : That was uncalled for! I can\\'t believe you said that! Matthew, did you\\n   hear what he said about you?\\nMatthew : Me? He was talking about you!\\nEliwood : Hector, why don\\'t you introduce us?\\nHector : The noisy one is Serra. Believe it or not, she\\'s a cleric.\\nSerra : yes, I am Serra, my lord. Pleased to meet you.\\nHector : And that\\'s Matthew. He does a lot of... sneaking around.\\nMatthew : My lord.\\nEliwood : Sneaking... around.\\nMatthew : Well... I, er... gather information, open doors, chests, and such.\\n   I\\'ve got... nimble fingers.\\nEliwood : That sounds... like a thief\\'s work...\\nHector : Well... Don\\'t let it worry you.\\nEliwood : But...\\nHector : This journey... I suspect it will be harder than you imagine. You may\\n   have to accept things like this if you want to survive.\\nEliwood : What is it, Hector? Do you know something?\\nHector : Nothing specific. Rumors abound, though. A league of assassins from\\n   Bern has been moving around in Lycia. Experienced bounty hunters and\\n   mercenaries are vanishing...\\nEliwood : That reminds me. One of the men who attacked us said something odd.\\nHector : What was it?\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, if I may?\\nHector : Marcus! Good to see you!\\nMarcus : Lord Hector, it\\'s been far too long. Your assistance is greatly\\n   appreciated.\\nHector : Come now, Marcus. No need for such formalities. Tell me what you\\n   heard.\\nMarcus : Of course. The apparent leader of that gang of thugs... He indicated\\n   that someone was watching Lord Eliwood... That someone needed him dead.\\nHector : Hmm... That is troubling. Actually, a captain of the guard was\\n   watching the fight when we arrived. He was a knight of Santaruz, and yet he\\n   just stood there and let a lord be attacked. I think he was planning on\\n   seeing you die.\\n\\nEliwood : So, Agung. What do you think? ... You might be right. Something may\\n   have happened to Lord Helman, too. Come! We must hurry to the castle!\\nHector : Eliwood! Who is this?\\nEliwood : This is Agung. I required tactical aid in the search for my father,\\n   and...\\nHector : Oh, I see. So this is who directed the battle plan back there, hm?\\n   You know, Agung, you\\'re very young. We\\'ve many strategists in Ostia, but\\n   none so young. Eliwood, are you sure about this one?\\nEliwood : Agung is still a student of military strategy, but... We\\'ve\\n   received nothing but sound advice so far. Agung has my trust.\\nHector : All right. I suppose I shall witness your skills firsthand. Well met,\\n   Agung.\\n\\nMatthew : Hello! How have you been, Agung? Eh? My secret\\'s revealed? Oh, that.\\n   Yes, it\\'s true. My guise as a common thief was but a ruse. I\\'ve served\\n   House Ostia for some time as a spy of sorts! Suprised? Well, regardless,\\n   it looks like we\\'ll be traveling together again. Here\\'s to our mutual\\n   survival!\\n\\nSerra : Eeeeeeee! Agung! Is it really you? It\\'s been far, far too long! You\\n   missed me, didn\\'t you? Of course you did. I knew it. Hm? Didn\\'t I tell you\\n   before? I\\'m in the employ of Ostia, Lycia\\'s ruling territory. I\\'ll be here\\n   to help you just like before! Aren\\'t you lucky!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.13  CHAPTER THIRTEEN : IN SEARCH OF TRUTH\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood enters Sanruz, only to be attacked by a strange group. In a desperate\\nmoment, he is rescued by a childhood friend, Marquess Ostia\\'s younger brother,\\nHector. The assailant\\'s leader reveals that an unknown party seeks Eliwood\\'s\\nhead... Eliwood cannot help but think this is related to his father\\'s\\ndisappearance. In search of more traces ofhis father\\'s footsteps, Eliwood\\nsets out for the castle of Lord Helman, the marquess of Santaruz.\\n\\nSantaruz Castle\\nHelman : Master Ephidel! What is the meaning of this?\\nEphidel : Peace, Lord Helman. Whatever is wrong?\\nHelman : You said you were just going to frighten Eliwood! Your men almost\\n   killed him! My patience is at an end! I\\'ve decided I must tell Eliwood\\n   everything and apologize.\\nEphidel : ..... You would betray us?\\nHelman : I am tired of you and the Black Fang! Now, remove yourself from my\\n   castle! Your presence pains me!\\nEphidel : Lord Helman... Is there nothing I can do to change your mind?\\nHelman : Nothing!\\nEphidel : In that case...you\\'re no longer of any use.\\nHelman : What!? Gaa... urrgh...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHector : There\\'s the castle, Eliwood!\\nEliwood : We have to speak with Lord Helman...\\nBoies : That\\'s not gonna happen, laddie!\\nEliwood : Who are you?\\nBoies : Who am I? Ah, boy, you\\'d do better to worry about yourself. You\\'ll be\\n   worm\\'s meat before much longer.\\nHector : You think so? I think my axe\\'ll change your mind.\\nBoies : Ha! the cub thinks he\\'s a wolf! Does your bite match your bark? Tell\\n   you what: if you make it to the castle alive, we\\'ll find out, eh? Geh heh\\n   heh hehhh!\\n\\nNPC  : Hey, you! Yeah, the new dog! Get this right, or you\\'re gone!\\nGuy  : I know, I know. I just got this job! I don\\'t want to lose it! \\'Course,\\n   the smart thing to do would have been not to get involved with this ugly\\n   bunch. Got to have gold if I want to eat, though. I was too picky before.\\n   If I think about the time I passed out in Caelin... Ooooh. Nothing funny\\n   about that! That man... What was his name... Matthew? If it hadn\\'t been\\n   for him, I would\\'ve starved to death...\\nNPC  : What are you mumbling about? Get over here now!\\nGuy  : Yes, yes, I\\'m coming! At least I\\'ve got work!\\n\\nLowen : Nice to be working with you, Agung! As a journeyman knight of Pherae,\\n   I\\'m here to serve Lord Eliwood and you, Agung! I await your command!\\n\\nHouse (11,11)\\nNPC  : A merchant just went running past here in a panic. He dropped some\\n   things. I tried to tell him, but... It looked like he\\'s the sort that drop\\n   things a lot...\\n\\nHouse (16,16)\\nNPC  : If you value your lives, stay clear of the castle southwest of here.\\n   There\\'s a swordsman named Guy... He\\'s young, but deadly. He carries a\\n   killing edge, a feaful sword to be sure. I\\'m warning you: find another\\n   road to the castle.\\n\\nVillage (2,15)\\nNPC  : This will never do! Look at the time! I must leave for Caelin now, or\\n   my business will be ruined. Time is money, after all. Hurry hurry! Rush\\n   rush rush!\\nMarcus : Huh? What\\'s this? That man must have dropped it...\\n\\nVillage (13,8)\\nNPC  : Ah, what good timing. Would you try this for me? It\\'s an invention of\\n   a great withc! Me! It\\'s a mine. It contains some very explosive magic.\\n   Hide it on the ground, and when an enemy steps on it... KA-BOOOOM!!! Hee\\n   hee hee... I\\'m still testing them, so that one\\'s free. Come back and tell\\n   me how it works.\\n\\nHouse (3,2)\\nNPC  : Your group moves like lightning. You must have an expert tactician\\n   giving you direction. I\\'d love to study under someone like that.\\n\\n\\nBoies : What\\'s this? You\\'ve made it this far? Ah, I paid too much for that\\n   worthless pack of sellswords!\\n\\nHector : Come on out! We\\'re here!\\nBoies : Well, well, well! You survived, I see. You\\'ll find that I\\'m a bit\\n   tougher than those fools you faced before!\\nHector : What have you done with Marquess Santaruz?\\nBoies : You want to know? You\\'ll have to best me first.\\n\\nBoies : You\\'ve done well to come this far, laddie!\\nEliwood : Where is Marquess Santaruz?\\nBoies : I imagine he\\'s on his way to a better place. Gehah! Geh heh hehhh!\\nEliwood : Wretched cur!\\n\\nBoies : You\\'ve beaten me... but you\\'re too late to save him... Too... too bad,\\n   eh, laddie? Geha ha... geha!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Lord Helman!!\\nHelman : ... Is that you... Eliwood?\\nEliwood : Hold on, my loard!\\nHelman : I... I must apologize... Your farther... He...\\nEliwood : Do you know something, sir?\\nHelman : I... If I hadn\\'t told Elbert... about... Darin\\'s plans... This\\n   would... never... have... Cough cough...\\nEliwood : Lord Helman!\\nHelman : ... Go to Laus... Darin... the marquess of Laus... knows all.\\nEliwood : Marquess Laus?\\nHelman : I\\'m sorry, Eliwood... I... I can\\'t...\\nEliwood : Hold on!\\nHelman : Beware... the Black... Fang.........\\nEliwood : Lord Helman!\\nHector : He\\'s gone...\\nEliwood : It can\\'t be...\\n\\nEliwood : Lord Helman... Why... ...Why did this happen?\\nHector : Blast! What is going on?!?\\nEliwood : ... We go to Laus. We must speak to the marquess of Laus, Lord\\n   Darin.\\nHector : You\\'re right. We should leave quickly. I\\'m not sure how far we can\\n   go today, but... I can\\'t sit still.\\nSteward : Pardon me...\\nHector : Hm?\\nSteward : If I may?\\nEliwood : Who are you?\\nSteward : I\\'m the steward of Santaruz. With our lord gone, what are we to do?\\nHector : First, you give Lord Helman a proper burial. After that... I\\'m sure\\n   the Lycian Council will have to meet. Stay here and defend the castle until\\n   you hear more.\\nSteward : I understand.\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go. We must keep moving.\\nHector : Yes... and now we seek answers for Marquess Santaruz, too.\\nEliwood : ... Lord Helman... May you find peace.\\n\\nAccept side quest?\\nYes     No\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.13X CHAPTER THIRTEEN X : THE PEDDLER MERLINUS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe dying words of Lord Helman stun Eliwood beyond belief. \"Darin, the\\nmarquess of Laus, knows all...\" Despite the pain it brings, Eliwood takes this\\nnewfound knowledge to heart and setus out for Laus once again. On the way to\\nLaus, he travels through a Caelin village. Eliwood and his party decide to\\nrest there for a night.\\n\\nHector : Bah! Dark already.\\nEliwood : We\\'ll have to stop here for the night. We\\'ll set out for Laus at the\\n   first sign of sunlight. Marcus, prepare the camp.\\nMarcus : Yes, my lord.\\nHector : So this is Caelin? You think we ought to present ourselves to Lord\\n   Hausen?\\nEliwood : We\\'re simply passing through, so I don\\'t see the need. I am curious\\n   how Lyndis is getting along, though.\\nHector : Lyndis?\\nEliwood : Marquess Caelin\\'s granddaughter.\\nHector : Oh, her. The missing heir who dealt with Lundgren last year. Didn\\'t\\n   you have something to do with that?\\nEliwood : Mm.\\nHector : And? The granddaughter? Is she a beauty?\\nEliwood : A beauty? She\\'s... I don\\'t... she\\'s... I think it must be her Sacae\\n   heritage. She\\'s... striking...\\nHector : Striking? Too bad, isn\\'t it?\\nEliwood : What?\\nHector : That we don\\'t have time to see her, loverboy.\\nEliwood : No! Lyndis and I are... We\\'re not...\\nHector : You\\'re not? Then why are you getting so worked up?\\nEliwood : Hector! Don\\'t make me angry!\\nHector : Ha ha ha ha! You are so much fun to tease! Huh? What was that? Did\\n   you hear something?\\nEliwood : It was a scream. Someone\\'s being attacked!\\nHector : Do we help?\\nEliwood : Of course!\\n\\nMerlinus : Oh noooooo! Someone! Help!!!\\nBandit1 : Grrr! Stupid old fool! He\\'s kept us running in circles for hours!\\nMerlinus : My... My valuable merchandise! What are you going to do?\\nPuzon : Hey, look at this. The old fool\\'s wealthy.\\nBandit1 : Huh huh huh. Our lucky day. Eh, Puzon?\\nMerlinus : Let go! Let go!! Will you let go!!!\\nBandit1 : What a racket! Puzon, can we get rid of this simpleton ?\\nPuzon : I suppose so. There\\'s no reason to let him live.\\nMerlinus : Oh my!! Eeeyaaaaahhh!\\nEliwood : Release him!\\nPuzon : Who--\\nEliwood : I told you to let the man go!\\nHector : If you move quickly, we\\'ll let you live.\\nPuzon : Ha! A pair of dandies like you? You know what I think? Living off your\\n   parent\\'s names, prancing about... I despise you! Come on! Don\\'t hold back!\\n   We\\'ll kill you all!\\n\\nMerlinus : Aaaiiieeee!!! You! They call you Agung, am I right? I am Merlinus,\\n   a humble and lowly merchant. I know nothing of combat. Please! You must\\n   protect me!\\n\\nVillage (15,12)\\nNPC  : Oh, my! Those ruffians are attacking you? Our village is in danger,\\n   too. We talked it over and... here. It\\'s all the money we collected. If\\n   you\\'ll chase off the bandits, it\\'s yours.\\n\\nPuzon : Heh. Looks like you\\'ve breathed your last!\\n\\nPuzon : Unbelievable... I was helpless to stop them...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNPC : Ooof... Blast! I won\\'t forget this!\\nHector : Then you\\'re smarter than you look! Get out of here!!\\nEliwood : Are you all right?\\nMerlinus : Hm? Oho!! I... I\\'ve been saved!\\nEliwood : We\\'ve driven them off. Are you injured?\\nMerlinus : No, not at all. As you can see, I\\'m as fine as fine can be.\\nEliwood : I\\'m glad to see that. We\\'ll take our leave then. Let\\'s go, Hector.\\nMerlinus : Wait a moment, please! A token of my thanks...\\nEliwood : Do not worry yourself. We did nothing to merit reward.\\nHector : That\\'s right. We\\'ve no need of a peddler\\'s junk.\\nMerlinus : P-P-Peddler?\\nEliwood : Hector!\\nHector : Oops!\\nMerlinus : Ahem! I am Merlinus. You\\'ll find no other traveling merchant whose\\n   goods compare. Don\\'t let your eyes fool you: I\\'m quite prosperous.\\nHector : Huh? You\\'re a merchant? Books and knives and all that, eh?\\nEliwood : Hector, your manners are terrible. Merlinus, please... Pay no mind\\n   to what this oaf has to say.\\nMerlinus : No, of course not. I wasn\\'t concerned at... Ahem! By the way, you\\n   two obviously come from highborn houses. Would you grant me the honor of\\n   your names?\\nEliwood : I am Eliwood, son of the marquess of Pherae.\\nHector : I\\'m Hector. Marquess Ostia\\'s brother.\\nMerlinus : Goodness! Ostia! Pherae! The greatest houses is all of Lycia!!\\n   Ahh... To be saved by noblemen such as yourselves... It is an honor beyond\\n   words!\\nHector : It\\'s nice to be appreciated for a change. Lately, people just seem\\n   to want us dead. Tell me, Merlinus, what are your plans?\\nMerlinus : Pardon? My plans, my lord? I had planned to travel Lycia selling\\n   my merchandise, but... It may not be possible in such dangerous times.\\nHector : If that\\'s the case, why don\\'t you come along with us?\\nEliwood : Hector?\\nHector : Our travels will not be ending anytime soon. We\\'ve gained more\\n   people and more items, right? It might be good to have help managing our\\n   things.\\nMerlinus : Oho! Now THAT is a splendid idea! Managing merchandise is my\\n   specialty, after all!\\nEliwood : Are you sure?\\nMerlinus : Quite sure, my lord. To be honest, I\\'ve dreamt of working for a\\n   noble house. To have my fondest wish granted in such a way... I cannot\\n   stem these tears of joy! Lord Hector! Lord Eliwood!! Take me into your\\n   bosoms and keep me safe forever!\\nEliwood : Uh... Thank you. Well met, Merlinus.\\nHector : We\\'re counting on you! Now, I\\'ve got some things I want you to\\n   carry...\\nMerlinus : Yes, of course. Whatever you have, Merlinus will keep!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.14  CHAPTER FOURTEEN : FALSE FRIENDS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nA droll merchant named Merlinus now joins Eliwood\\'s group. With Merlinus in\\ntow, they set out for Laus the following day. Laus is located in the heart of\\nLycia, a territory ruled by the power-hungry marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.\\nPreparation for the war of which the Pheraen magistrate spoke... The\\ndisappearance of Eliwood\\'s father,Elbert... The death of Marquess Santaruz...\\nDo these all revolve around Lord Darin? In Eliwood\\'s heart, the need for truth\\nis drowned in fear... A fear of what that truth may hold.\\n\\nDarin : Are you certain? Pherae\\'s heir is here?\\nErik : Yes, Father. We\\'ve just received word from our lookouts.\\nHe\\'s still beyond that hill, but he\\'ll be here before long.\\nDarin : Lord Ephidel, what is the meaning of this?\\nEphidel : Perhaps when they reached Santaruz Castle, Lord Helman was still\\n   clinging to life.\\nDarin : You can\\'t be serious!\\nEphidel : He couldn\\'t have lasted too long, but... maybe he told them\\n   something.\\nDarin : That\\'s terrible! Our plan! It\\'s all for naught, isn\\'t it?\\nEphidel : No need to be so alarmed, my lord. Even if he told young Eliwood\\n   something of our schemes, Pherae no longer has any power. All Eliwood could\\n   do is perhaps inform Marquess ostia.\\nDarin : Ostia?! That would ruinous! Lord Uther may be young and new to the\\n   throne, but he\\'s dangerous. That addlepated Helman! He was a coward to the\\n   end! To betray us now, when we\\'re so close... We only need a little more\\n   time to complete our plans for rebellion!\\nEphidel : Then before Marquess Ostia becomes aware of any of this, you would\\n   do well to stop them here.\\nDarin : Yes, you\\'re right, of course. We do have a chance. They have to pass\\n   through Laus to get to Ostia. We can still silence them!\\nEphidel : They must not pass. No matter the cost.\\nDarin : Let us make haste. Call up our finest troops.\\nErik : Father! Please, let me take the command.\\nDarin : Erik! Tell me, Son, can you succeed?\\nErik : That clod Eliwood and I studied together in Ostia. He\\'s a trusting\\n   fool. If he sees me, he\\'ll lower his guard. And when he does, we strike!\\nDarin : I see.\\nEphidel : I beg your pardon. Is this not too much for him? If, by strange\\n   chance, he fell, things could turn for the worse.\\nDarin : No, I know I\\'m the lad\\'s father, but Erik\\'s quite clever, I tell you.\\n   Snuffing Pherae\\'s whelp will be no trouble at all. It\\'s settled! It\\'s up\\n   to you now, Erik. Bring me the head of Pherae\\'s darling son!\\nErik : Yes, Father! I will not fail you!\\n\\nHector : Look around... They truly are preparing for battle. Bah! Marquess\\n   Laus! What is he scheming?\\nEliwood : .....\\nHector : You don\\'t much look like you want to go to the castle.\\nEliwood : If we go and learn the truth, we may have to go to war.\\nHector : That\\'s fine with me!\\nEliwood : I... I\\'ve no love for war. If I concentrate on the foe before me,\\n   I\\'m fine. If I picture families, innocents caught up in our foolish\\n   politics? If I imagine them... All I can do is pray for a way to solve\\n   things peacefully.\\nHector : Eliwood....\\n\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood! A knight has ridden forth from the castle.\\nEliwood : A lone knight?\\nMarcus : Yes, my lord. Our scouts say it\\'s Marquess Laus\\'s son, Erik. He is\\n   asking to see you.\\nEliwood : Erik?\\nHector : Gah. Why did it have to be taht buffoon?\\nEliwood : I will see him. Bring him here.\\nHector : I\\'m leaving. I never could abide him. I\\'ll go for a ride and\\n   survey our surroundings.\\n\\nErik : Hello! It\\'s been a long time, Eliwood!\\nEliwood : Erik... What is your business?\\nErik : My business? What do you mean? I heard my old friend was here in\\n   Laus. I merely thought I\\'d ride out to greet you!\\nEliwood : .....\\nErik : So tell me, friend, what brings you to Laus? Are you... on your way\\n  to Ostia?\\nEliwood : Hm? Why would you think that?\\nErik : Well, you were always such good friends with Hector. He and I\\n   never... got along very well. For a noble, his behavior was crude, and\\n   his manner of speech... You would have thought him a peasant on first\\n   glance. You\\'re still friends with Hector, aren\\'t you? When did you see\\n   him last? How do you communicate?\\nEliwood : Erik... You\\'re after something. What is it?\\nErik : Pardon?\\nEliwood : Everywhere I look, Laus prepares for battle. What are you and\\n   your father planning? I will know the truth!\\nErik : Hm... I\\'d hoped to wait until you\\'d told me of Ostia. Of whether\\n   you\\'ve spoken with the marquess or not.\\nEliwood : What are you talking about?\\nErik : Hm heh heh... Eliwood, I have always despised you. How I\\'ve longed\\n   to smash you and your pathetic morality into pieces! I\\'ve dreamed of\\n   this day, and here it is at last!\\nHector : Too bad you\\'ll not live to see the end of it.\\nEliwood : Hector!\\nErik : Y-You! Hector! You couldn\\'t... Have you spoken with Ostia already?\\nHector : Maybe we have, maybe we haven\\'t. Eliwood, this mongrel has troops\\n   lying in ambush all around us. Laus regulars, every one. We\\'re in for a\\n   rough time.\\nErik : Heh heh... There\\'s little point in fighting. You\\'re trapped! My\\n   forces will overwhelm you, an unending torrect of soldiers! Laus\\'s elite\\n   knight are at the ready as well. Heh heh... How long do you think you\\n   can survive?\\nEliwood : Craven cur!\\n\\nHannah : Hee hee hee... A world of trouble you\\'ve landed yourself in, yes?\\nHector : Who--!? You startled me, old woman! You should get out of here.\\n   This is going to be a bad place to stay if you plan on living.\\nHannah : I want to see the one searching for his father. Marquess Pherae\\'s\\n   son.\\nHector : Listen up, old woman! You\\'re close to death as it is! Quit your\\n   yammering and move on!\\nEliwood : Hector! You should mind your manners. I am Eliwood. May I ask your\\n   name, milady?\\nHannah : Ho ho ho. What a polite young man. I\\'m Hannah, a fortune-teller. I\\n   came here to help you.\\nEliwood : Can you tell me where my father\\'s gone?\\nHannah : No... but... I can see other things... useful things. I can tell\\n   you what weapons to take into battle, as well as who should wield them.\\n   Things of that nature.\\nEliwood : I see...\\nHector : Don\\'t tell me you believe any of this.\\nEliwood : I have no reason to believe or disbelieve in Hannah\\'s powers. But\\n   I\\'ll not rule out anything if it helps me find my father.\\n\\nMerlinus : Lord Eliwood! Lord Hector! I make my living as a humble merchant.\\n   If you have any items you no longer need, please let poor Merlinus take\\n   them.\\nHannah : Heh heh heh. I\\'m here, too. Speak to me for auguries before you\\n   engage the enemy. My service are not free, but they may save you from\\n   paying a greater price!\\n\\nAugury :\\nMany of your foe will be carrying spears. You should take axes... Yes, many\\naxes. Hmm... And if that shrewish cleric girl is with you, take her as well.\\nShe might well meet an old friend.\\nThe weather, though... It doesn\\'t look very good. Be prepared for sudden\\nchanges.\\nYou know, you should take a rapier. It will serve you well against many a foe.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMerlinus : Lord Eliwood! Shall I join you? If you deploy my tent, I can help\\n   with equipment. I can switch items for you and hold them if your packs are\\n   full. However, my tent cannot be moved about, so if you deploy it, it will\\n   rquired a guard. I beg your understanding.\\n\\nMerlinus\\'s merchant tent can be deployed on this map. If you deploy the tent,\\nany items you cannot carry can be sent to the tent. However, the tent is\\nvulnerable to enemy attack. If the tent loses all its HP, it will vanish from\\nthe map and remain unavailable until the next map. Merlinus\\'s tent gains one\\nlevel for every battle it survives. The tent will be harder to destroy as it\\nincreases in level.\\n\\nDeploy Merlinus?\\nYes     No\\n\\nMarcus : Agung! Let me take the point. There may be many of the, but numbers\\n   are meaningless! We are knights of Pherae. These mice of Laus will never\\n   defeat us!\\n\\nErk  : Hm. We certainly could stand some assistance...\\nNPC  : I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s just not possible. If we disobey Marquess Laus, who\\n   knows what might happen to us?\\nErk  : I understand. We\\'ll seek our aid elsewhere.\\nNPC  : You\\'ll find the same answer everywhere you go. Eventually, you\\'ll have\\n   have to do as the marquess orders. You would do well to tell your employer\\n   the same thing.\\nErk  : Hm. Good day to you.\\n\\n\\nNPC  : Priscilla! Has your escort returned yet?\\nPriscilla : No. He left yesterday in search of a way out of here... I just\\n   hope the soldiers of Laus haven\\'t captured him.\\nNPC  : His search for help must have been fruitless. Maruqess Laus has ordered\\n   that no aid be given to you. There\\'s really nothing that any of us can do.\\n   I apologize, but...\\nPriscilla : No, no. You could turn me over to the marquess, and yet you\\n   continue to grant me asylum. I\\'m grateful for that, Of course, if I simply\\n   went to the castle, this would be all over.\\nNPC  : Don\\'t fret over that. None of us are overly fond of the marquess. He\\'s\\n   always threatening us. He treats us like slaves. All of those war\\n   preparations? We want nothing to do with them. We may be divided into\\n   territories, but we\\'re Lycians one and all. We may be invaded by another\\n   country one day, but why does he want to start a war here at home? None\\n   of us understand what he is doing.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nPriscilla : Again ? Are you another messenger from the marquess? Please, do\\n   not waste your time. I will not change my decision. Pardon? Marquess Laus\\n   did not send you? I... I beg your forgiveness. It was my mistake. Say...\\n   If it\\'s not too much trouble, might I leave with you? I\\'m on a journey.\\n   Marquess Laus is barring my way, and... I\\'m trapped. I am trained in the\\n   use of staves. Please, help me.\\n\\nHouse (23,16)\\nNPC  : Listen to this! Have you heard tell of the marquess\\'s infatuation?\\n   There\\'s a young woman staying in a village on the harbor. Her speech, her\\n   looks, everything about her has the seeming of a princess. The marquess\\'s\\n   attentions border on obsession. He\\'s sent countless envoys to invite her\\n   to the castle, but she rejects him at every turn. Now, the marquess has\\n   guards around the village keeping her trapped. She has no way to escape.\\n   It\\'s so sad.\\n\\nHouse (24,16)\\nNPC  : The pirates from that citadel in the south keep raiding a nearby\\n   village. The marquess ignores our pleas for help. We\\'ll all be overrun\\n   someday. Someone should go to that village and warn them...\\n\\nVillage (10,15)\\nNPC  : You\\'re battling Erik and his men, right? Let me tell you, I\\'m on your\\n   side! My granddaughter... Marquess Laus took her away. He found her pretty,\\n   and forced her to the castle. It\\'s not much, but please take this. It\\'s a\\n   large sword, so you have to be strong to use it. It\\'s a bit unwieldy, but\\n   it is a might weapon nonetheless. I hope you can defeat the marquess\\'s son,\\n   Erik. It would make our lives more pleasant. Good luck to you.\\n\\nHouse (8,14)\\nNPC  : Is it true we\\'re battling Castle Ostia? What could that foold of a\\n   marquess be thinking? Laus has no chance of defeating Lycia\\'s most powerful\\n   territory! The marquess\\'s son, Erik is nothing but a power-hungry dullard!\\n   And the marquess himself is a lecher, plain and simple! What a pair! Do\\n   they believe they\\'re a match for an Ostian general? Oh... Forget everything\\n   I said. We never talked, OK?\\n\\nBandit : Eh? What\\'s all this? Looks like a war\\'s broken out. Aha ha ha!\\n   Perfect! Time for a raid! Up and at \\'em, mates! That village is ripe for\\n   plunder!\\n\\nWhen it is about to rain :\\nHannah : Mmm... My bones ache... The signs point to rain, yes? Watch\\n   yourselves.\\n\\nWhen the rain is about to stop :\\nHannah : Mm... Hm... This rain... It will end shortly.\\n\\nText that will only show up if you have not killed Erik by end of turn 4 :\\nErik : Blast! They\\'re stronger that I had supposed! To the castle! I want all\\n   the reinforcements available, and I want them now!\\nSoldier : Lord Erik is struggling! He requests reinforcements!\\nDarin : What? Ready the men.\\nEphidel : Unbelievable... These numbers cannot stop them.\\nDarin : Ephidel? W-Where are you going?\\nEphidel : it seems that conquering Lycia might have been too much to ask of\\n   you after all. I must inform my master. The Black Fang will be leaving at\\n   once.\\nDarin : No! You... You can\\'t abandon us! Not at this stage!\\nEphidel : Who was it that said Ostia mustn\\'t learn of our plans? Wasn\\'t it\\n   you, Lord Darin? The marquess of Laus himself?\\nDarin : Y-Yes, it was. There\\'s no turning back for me. Not now! P-P-Please!\\n   One more... Give me one more chance. I assure you, I will not disappoint\\n   Lord Nergal!\\nEphidel : Very well... Assemble your men. We will regroup elsewhere.\\nDarin : Eh? You can\\'t mean... My son... my home... Am I to abandon them?\\nEphidel : Would you fall in disgrace along with your son? Our master, Lord\\n   Nergal, is offering you the throne of all Lycia... Surely a few sacrifices\\n   are not too much to ask?\\nDarin : Yes... You\\'re right. My destiny is greater than this. I was born to\\n   be king of Lycia.\\nEphidel : And as for an heir? You\\'re still young, my lord. You will have time.\\n   You must not let a moment\\'s sentimentality cloud your judgment.\\nDarin : ...\\nErik : Where are my reinforcements? Why haven\\'t they come? I\\'ve no choice. I\\n   must attack! You! To the castle! Find more men!\\nSoldier : Yes, my lord!\\n\\n\\nErik : You\\'ve always been... an eyesore to me. No matter how hard I tried...\\n   You two garnered all the attention... all the praise. In the classroom...\\n   on the training grounds... Everywhere and everything!\\nHector : Erik. You always did care more about appearances than ability. If\\n   you\\'d had even a hint of skill, perhaps you\\'d--\\nErik : Hold your tongue! I will hear no more! No more!\\n\\n\\nErik : Unhand me! I am no one\\'s prisoner! Gwaaa!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHector : Come on, Erik! Get up!\\nErik : You... You peasants... You can\\'t treat a proper noble like this!\\nHector : It\\'s too late for niceties! Be thankful you\\'re still breathing!\\nEliwood : Erik, you must tell me. Where is your father? We\\'ve searched the\\n   entire castle, and there\\'s no one here.\\nErik : D-Don\\'t be ridiculous! My father would not abandon... No! He\\'d never...\\n   Ephidel...\\nEliwood : Ephidel? Who\\'s that?\\nErik : ......\\nHector : Speak, cur!! Do you want to die here?\\nErik : Ah!\\nEliwood : Hector! Erik... please. You must tell us everything you know. I...\\n   I just want to know where my father is.\\nErik : ..... ...Ephidel... He appeared at the castle one year ago. He came...\\n   and my father changed. Ostia\\'s position had always bothered my father...\\n   He felt Laus deserved to rule all of Lycia. But he\\'d never gone so far as\\n   to speak of rebellion.\\nHector : Did you say... rebellion?\\nErik : Ephidel had something... With it, he convinced my father to set this\\n   plan in motion. My father then sent envoys to several other marquesses.\\n   Marquess Pherae,he had approved of the idea.\\nHector : What?\\nEliwood : Never! My father would never agree to such a thing!\\nErik : Believe or disbelieve. That is your choice. First was Marquess\\n   Santaruz. Then Marquess Pherae\\'s reply arrived. Marquess Pherae visited\\n   here six months ago to seal his approval.\\nEliwood : That\\'s not... possible...\\nErik : My father and yours argues vehemently that day. Marquess Pherae always\\n   distrusted Ephidel. He tried to convince my fahter to sent Ephidel and the\\n   Black Fang assassins out of Lycia. My father would not be persuaded, and\\n   Marquess Pherae left the castle. As you know, he then disappeared. I doubt\\n   he\\'s still alive.\\nEliwood : No!\\nHector : Shut your mouth!\\nErik : Eliwood said he wanted to hear everything. My father... He is but\\n   Ephidel\\'s puppet. He\\'ll listen to anything that villain says. Even watch\\n   his own son... die... Those are the sort of people you\\'re dealing with.\\n   Marquess Pherae betrayed them. They would not let him live! Ha ha... ha ha\\n   ha ha ha ha...\\nEliwood : Ah...\\nHector : Wait! Eliwood!\\n\\nHector : Eliwood...\\nEliwood : My father is alive... And... I cannot believe he supports...\\n   rebellion. There must be... There has to be a reason...\\nHector : I know. I don\\'t believe any of this for an instant. My brother\\n   trusted Marquess Pherae more than anyone. First, we\\'ll find your father\\n   and discover the truth. We\\'ll talk to my brother after that.\\nEliwood : Hector, I\\'m sorry...\\nHector : Don\\'t look like that. Your father is surely alive. Right?\\nEliwood : Yes, of course... Marquess Laus... Black Fang assassins... Now this\\n   mysterious Ephidel... I\\'ll find them all and prove my father\\'s innocence!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.15  CHAPTER FIFTEEN : NOBLE LADY OF CAELIN\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn Laus, Erik tells Eliwood of a plan. A plot to use Laus as starting ground\\nina rebellion against Ostia. Eliwood needs proof to believe these accusations,\\nand so he and his allies pursue Darin, the fleeing marquess of Laus. Where\\nthat chase would lead, Eliwood could not have known.\\n\\nLaus Castle\\nHector : Blast! Where on earth has that snake Darin gone?\\nEliwood : I doubt he\\'s left Lycia yet, but... Hector... it\\'s been five days.\\n   The death of Marquess Santaruz... Our attack on Laus Castle... Word of\\n   these things must have reached Lord Uther by now. And yet he shows no sing\\n   of action... Why?\\nHector : I\\'m sure he has his reasons. My brother has other concerns tying his\\n   hands right now.\\nEliwood : What do you mean?\\nHector : It\\'s Bern. We\\'ve received disturbing reports over the past few\\n   months. King Desmond is behaving oddly. If he sees even the slightest crack\\n   in Lycia\\'s defenses, we believe he\\'ll invade with all of Bern\\'s might\\n   behind him. My brother has only recently become marquess, as well as head\\n   of the Lycian League. He can\\'t allow another country to see any weakness or\\n   discord.\\nEliwood : He has to present the face of stability and strength, is that it?\\nHector : Yes. It seems every country has a spy working in Ostia right now.\\n   They all want to assess the new marquess\\'s temperament and skill. If they\\n   sense anything wrong, word will spread like wildfire.\\nEliwood : Hector, you\\'re the marquess\\'s brother... Would not being at his side\\n   be seen as someting \"wrong\"?\\t\\nHector : The marquess\\'s brother is a well-known lout. If I WERE at court,\\n   they\\'d sense something wrong.\\nEliwood : You\\'re not too proud of that reputation, are you?\\nHector : Not in the least.\\n\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood! Lord Hector!\\nEliwood : What is it, Marcus? Have you heard something?\\nMarcus : Yes, my lord. A messenger from the east! Castle Caelin has fallen to\\n   a surprise attack from Marquess Laus!\\nEliwood : Castle Caelin?!\\nHector : They\\'ve struck again.\\nEliwood : Lord Hausen, is he unharmed?\\nMarcus : We\\'ve no word on Lord Hausen or his granddaughter, the lady Lyndis.\\nEliwood : I never expected them to attack Caelin... Lord Hausen... Lyndis...\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, Lord Hector... What should we do?\\nHector : They might still be alive, right? There\\'s only one thing we can do!\\nEliwood : We ride to their aid! There may still be time!\\n\\nCastle Caelin\\nKent : Milday, I\\'ve returend, and I have brought news. Laus soldiers are\\n   scattered from the castle to the edge of this forest. There must be at\\n   least 50 soldiers!\\nSain : Are you sure about this, milady? We barely escaped. Going back to the\\n   castle would mean almost certain death.\\nLyn  : My grandfather is in the castle. I left the castle on his orders,\\n   but... I can\\'t leave him in there alone!\\nWil  : The numbers we face... Rescuing Lord Hausen will be no easy task.\\nSain : I wonder if we can expect any reinforcements.\\nKent : I overheard some of the Laus soldiers talking. They claim that Lord\\n   Eliwood invaded Laus and drove them out.\\nLyn  : Eliwood? Why would he attack Laus?\\nKent : It gets even more interesting... Not only did Marquess Laus abandon his\\n   castle, but he also left his son, Erik, behind when he fled here to Caelin.\\nSain : That\\'s despicable! He abandoned his own son?\\nLyn  : But at least we know Eliwood is in Laus. We might be able to ask him\\n   for help. ...Assuming there were a way to contact him.\\nWil  : If we are to avoid being caught, the best path would be through the\\n   forest. Shall I go?\\nLyn  : I suspect you\\'re right. Horses cannot move well in woods... It\\'ll take\\n   you a while, but you can travel lightly...\\nFlorina : Lady Lyndis! I\\'ll go! I can fly above the forest. I can be in Laus\\n   faster than anyone else.\\nLyn  : Florina? You can\\'t do this on your own! It\\'s not possible!\\nFlorina : Thanks to my time here, I\\'m no longer as timid around men as I used\\n   to be. And I\\'ve met Lord Eliwood before. I\\'m sure I can do this on my own.\\nLyn : It will be terribly dangerous... You understand, don\\'t you?\\nFlorina : yes. But... I promised myself I would become braver for you. I\\'m not\\n   the weak little Florina I used to be. I\\'ll be fine. Trust me.\\nLyn : You\\'ve convinced me. The job\\'s yours, Florina. But you must promise me\\n   that you won\\'t try anything impossible!\\nFlorina : Yes, my lady. Farewell!\\n\\nSain : Did you hear our meek Florina? She sounded most forceful! Beautiful!\\nKent : She\\'s become a full-fledged pegasus knight.\\nLyn  : Yes, she has.\\nWil  : All for you, Lady Lyndis. That\\'s quite gallant.\\nLyn  : When we lived on the plains, I was always her protector. I know I\\n   shouldn\\'t feel sad, and yet...\\n\\nSoldier : Commander Bauker! There\\'s something in the southern skies.\\nBauker : Is that... a pegasus knight? Where do you suppose she\\'s going? It\\n   doesn\\'t matter. We\\'ve been told not to let anyone out of Caelin. Archers!\\n   Advance! Bring her down!\\nFlorina : To reach Laus, I must go over the forest... and fly north. Then,\\n   I\\'ll have to... Wait! Who are those people? They fly no banner, and yet...\\n   Ah! That man in the lead! It\\'s Lord Eliwood! He\\'s come to Caelin\\'s aid!\\n   That\\'s wonderful. I have to tell him where Lady Lyndis is waiting!\\n\\nHector : I\\'ve spotted the enemy... Why are their archers advancing? They\\'re\\n   aiming at something up high.\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, look! Up there! A pegasus knight!\\nFlorina : Lord Eliwood!\\nEliwood : Could it really be... Florina, is that you?\\nFlorina : Yes! I\\'m Lady Lyndis\\'s...\\nEliwood : Florina! Fly lower!\\nFlorina : Wha-- Oh! Aaaaaaah!!!\\nEliwood : Florina!!!\\nFlorina : ...... Ah...\\nEliwood : Can you hear me? Florina?\\nFlorina : Lord Eliwood? ...I...\\nEliwood : Those archers almost hit you. You avoided the arrows, but you lost\\n   your balance.\\nFlorina : I\\'m sorry. I\\'m such trouble...\\nEliwood : I\\'m just glad you\\'re not hurt. Tell me, Florina, weren\\'t you with\\n   Lyndis?\\nFlorina : Yes! Lord Eliwood, Lady Lyndis is beyond that forest. She\\'s waiting\\n   for a chance to assault the castle.\\nEliwood : She\\'s what!? Ah... Still, it\\'s good to hear she\\'s safe.\\nFlorina : She\\'s fine. However, Lord Hausen\\'s been captured. He\\'s still in the\\n   castle.\\nEliwood : I see. Let\\'s go then!\\n\\nBauker : Someone get up there and scour the area! I want to know if we brought\\n   down that pegasus knight! If she\\'s still breathing, make her stop!\\nsoldier : My load! To the west! We\\'re under attack! It\\'s the Pheraen noble,\\n   Eliwood!\\nBauker : He\\'s here, eh? Now\\'s our chance to show Marquess Laus our loyalty.\\n   Our opponents are a motley band of fools! They\\'re no match for us!\\n\\n\\nAugury :\\nI see a new companion... Strong of heart, strong of will. You must combine\\nyour strengths and work together. Lances... Yes, lance wielders are invaluable\\nhere. Use the woods well. You... You will need magic, yes? And rapiers and\\nhammers, as well.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nText only show up if you use Erk in this chapter :\\n\\nErk  : Pherae\\'s new tactician... It was you all along, wasn\\'t it, Agung? Me?\\n   I\\'m still traveling in pursuit of knowledge. I\\'ll never outstrip my tutor,\\n   but I\\'m getting a bit closer... Well, Agung, tell me what you need me to\\n   do.\\n\\nHouse (10,12)\\nNPC  : Are you one of Eliwood\\'s soldiers? You have that look about you. The\\n   villagers are saying that you can defeat an enemy in the blink of an eye.\\n   When I get older, I\\'m going to be that swift! Just you waint and see!\\n\\nHouse (7,13)\\nNPC  : Your company seems close-knit. It\\'s vital to have friends who support\\n   and assist you, isn\\'t it? You have to be close to someone if you really\\n   wanted to get along. Stay close to those with whom you\\'re compatible\\n   to strengthen your bond. A reading by a fortune-teller will tell you who\\n   you\\'re compatible with. But don\\'t become so concerned about it that you\\n   forget to fight!\\n\\nHouse (20,3)\\nNPC  : Different shops carry different items for sale. If you find something\\n   you\\'ve never seen, you should buy it, just to try. By the way, have you\\n   been to the local shop? If not, you should drop in. My daughter runs the\\n   place.\\n\\nHouse (22,6)\\nNPC  : Weapons are only as strong as the material they\\'re made of. Most of\\n   the weapons you have now are made of iron, right? Iron is a poor match for\\n   steel, and poorer still for silver! Slim weapons are weaker than iron ones,\\n   but easier to wield. Good weapons are expensive, but they\\'re worth the\\n   cost.\\n\\nVillage (13,3)\\nNPC  : Ah, you there! You\\'re Caelin knights, aren\\'t you? Marquess Laus\\'s man,\\n   the one called Bauker... He seems like a gentle man, but his skill is near\\n   legendary. Do you carry weapons suited to battling knights? Take this if\\n   you please. Got a Heavy spear.\\n\\nVillage (2,6)\\nNPC  : Castle Caelin\\'s been seized by Marquess Laus\\'s men. We don\\'t know\\n   what\\'s become of Lord Hausen... We\\'ve been saving this for our daughter\\'s\\n   wedding, but... it might serve you better now. Please help Marquess Caelin.\\n   Our lord needs rescuing. Got a Red Gem.\\n\\nBauker : Prepare to fall before your master!\\n\\nBauker : We\\'ve been... defeated? Such... a shame...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Commander Bauker... He was a fierce enemy. Lyndis, once we\\'ve\\n   defeated the remaining foe, the castle\\'s yours.\\nLyn  : Thank you, Eliwood. If not for your help, I don\\'t know where I\\'d be\\n   right now.\\nEliwood : All of this happened because we routed Lord Darin at Laus. It\\'s\\n   only right that we help.\\nLyn  : You explained your motives to me, Eliwood. This is about your father.\\n   I would do the same thing in your position. What happened in Caelin is not\\n   your fault.\\nEliwood : Thank you. However, until your castle is yours again, I take\\n   responsibility.\\nLyn  : I understand. Thank you.\\nHector : Eliwood! We\\'re moving into the castle!\\nEliwood : All right.\\nLyn  : Who\\'s that?\\nEliwood : Oh, yes. Let me introduce you. Hector!\\nHector : What?\\nEliwood : This is Lyndis. She\\'s Lord Hausen\\'s granddaughter. Lyndis, this is\\n   Hector. He\\'s Lord Uther\\'s brother.\\nLyn  : His brother? Really?\\nHector : Yes.\\nLyn  : I was watching the way he fights... He\\'s not like you, Eliwood. He\\'s\\n   somewhat like my own knights, but different still. He relies so much on\\n   power. It\\'s like he\\'s never been...\\nHector : I haven\\'t. I taught myself how to fight.\\nLyn  : I\\'ve no issue with that, but the way you swing that axe around...\\n   You\\'re a threat to your allies! You should be more watchful.\\nHector : What did you say?\\nEliwood : Lyndis? What\\'s come over you?\\nLyn  : Hm? Oh... I... My apologies. I didn\\'t intend to seem so critical.\\nHector : ......\\nEliwood : Granted, Hector\\'s style may be a tad dangerous, but... There\\'s no\\n   one I depend on more. You may think him careless, but he\\'s always aware of\\n   his surroundings.\\nHector : The more you praise me, the less worthy I sound.\\nEliwood : Lyndis, once you fight alongside Hector, I\\'m sure you\\'ll understand.\\nLyn  : I\\'m sure you\\'re right. I apologize, Hector. I\\'m honored to have your\\n   help.\\nHector : No apology necessary. I\\'m glad I can lend a hand.\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go inside, shall we?\\n\\nLyn  : Agung! Is it really you, Agung? So good to see you! Have you been well?\\nKent : Well met, Agung. Good to see you again.\\nSain : Well! This really is a pleasant surprise!\\nWil  : Hello, Agung! Has it really been a year?\\nLyn  : What\\'s wrong, Florina? You needn\\'t hide back there.\\nFlorina : Um... Nice to see you again. I don\\'t suppose you... Do you remember\\n   me?\\nLyn  : Everyone who remained in Caelin speaks of you fondly. We\\'re always\\n   saying \"I wonder where Agung is...\" Yes, you are right here. This isn\\'t the\\n   best time to catch up. We\\'re here to rescue my grandfather. Agung, will you\\n   help me again?\\n\\nDarin : Ri... Ridiculous... Even Bauker?\\nHausen : Lord Darin, it\\'s time to give up this madness. Further resistance is\\n   meaningless. For what you\\'ve done, you may never be forgiven, but it\\'s not\\n   too late to try. Tell Eliwood everything. He\\'ll intervene with Marquess\\n   Ostia on your behalf...\\nDarin : I... I\\'ve lost...\\nHausen : Hurry! Eliwood will be here in no time. Let me speak for you. Gurr...\\n   Guaaaa!!\\nEphidel : None of that now. Marquess Laus needs no troublesome advice.\\nDarin : L-Lord Ephidel?\\nEphidel : There is no turning back for you now. You should know that. First,\\n   Marquess Santaruz... and now Marquess Caelin. Both deaths are on your head.\\nDarin : What? It was by your hand that they both died! I-I never asked for\\n   this.\\nEphidel : yes, I killed them... for you.\\nDarin : To... trap me?\\nEphidel : Don\\'t be absurd. I follow my master\\'s orders. My only wish is to\\n   deliver your dreams to you. The crown of a united Lycia... And once that is\\n   done, dominion over the entire continent. Is that not what you desire?\\nDarin : ... ... ... Yes... Yes, of course. That dream IS still worth a few\\n   sacrifices, isn\\'t it?\\nEphidel : You\\'re exactly right. Our plans may have gone drastically awry, but\\n   as long as we have the master\\'s power behind us, we cannot be defeated.\\n   We\\'d do well to leave now, before those meddlesome worms arrive. You will\\n   leave everyone from Laus behind. We will use them to delay our foe.\\nDarin : Everyone... My soldiers? But... who will protect me?\\nEphidel : The Black Fang and I will more than suffice for that task. There is\\n   nothing else you need, I assure you.\\nDarin : yes... I... I see that now. Where do we go from here?\\nEphidel : To the Dragon\\'s Gate... Our master awaits us there. The master has\\n   informed me our hostage may be all we need. If all goes well, we may be\\n   able to perform the ceremony with him alone.\\nDarin : oh! Is that so? I suppose we\\'ve nothing to worry about.\\nEphidel : That is correct. Now please, begin your retreat. I have two or three\\n   orders to give, then I will be right behind you.\\n\\nEphidel : Pathetic imbecile... Leila? Where are you?\\nLeila : I\\'m here.\\nEphidel : While Eliwood is occupied, finish off Marquess Caelin and hide the\\n   body. The enemy will waste precious time searching for him.\\nLeila : As you command...\\nEphidel : You know, you\\'ve only been with the Black Fang a short while.\\n   However, you are quite skilled... I look forward to watching you.\\nLeila : Yes, sir.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.16  CHAPTER SIXTEEN : WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood and colleagues defeat Bauker, one of Marquess Laus\\'s lackeys. They\\nthen press on toward Castle Caelin. Yet inside the castle many Laus soldiers\\nremain. Eliwood and friends begin their assault on the castle to save Marquess\\nCaelin.\\n\\nEliwood : There are still quite a few Laus soldiers in the castle.\\nHector : Where are the Caelin guards?\\nLyn  : I think about half of them were killed in the surprise attack. The\\n   survivors must be here somewhere...\\nEliwood : They might be locked away as prisoners... We\\'d better rescues them\\n   quickly. If Marquess Laus decides to hold them hostage, it will make\\n   seizing the throne much more difficult.\\nHector : It\\'s settle! Let\\'s find the guards and retake the castle!\\nLyn  : Hold on, Grandfather. We\\'ll be there shortly.\\nEliwood : Seize the throne! It\\'s time to reclaim the castle!\\n\\n\\nAugury :\\nSky riders beware... This battle is not for you. You will need a thief. There\\nwill be a meeting... Take the polite girl... The flame-haired beauty. And\\nagain, take your rapier and hammer.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Agung. The captured Caelin soldiers are most likely exhausted. I\\'d\\n   like to protect them and keep them from having to fight. I realize that\\n   makes it difficult for you to play a strategy, but... I will do my best\\n   to take up their share of the fighting. Now, please tell us what we should\\n   do, Agung.\\n\\nRaven : Hey, you. Let me out of here.\\nSoldier : What?\\nRaven : Marquess Ostia\\'s brother is among your enemy, right? Let me out, and\\n   I\\'ll help you. But I must have the brother. I\\'ve a score to settle with\\n   house Ostia.\\nSoldier : Do you think me a fool? You work for house Caelin! I cannot trust\\n   your word!\\nRaven : Then I\\'ll have to break down this door and go through you. You were\\n   using Lucius as a hostage, but now he\\'s here with me...\\nSoldier : Uh...\\nLucius : No, Lord Raven! You musn\\'t! You cannot betray your debt to Marquess\\n   Caelin.\\nRaven : Shut up, Lucius. You think me foolish, but you don\\'t understand...\\n   How about it?\\nSoldier : Very well. You! Get out! Remember, if you betray us, your companion\\n   dies.\\nRaven : I see. Just remember, if that happens, you die next.\\nSoldier : Urr...\\nLucius : Wait! You can\\'t go alone! It\\'s too dangerous!\\nRaven : Lucius, stay here and be quiet. I\\'ll be back for you.\\nLucius : Lord Raven!\\n\\n\\nEnd of Turn 6 :\\nSoldier : What in blazes!? It\\'s getting even noisier than before.\\nLucius : Isn\\'t that the sound of combat?\\nSoldier : It must be Lady Lyndis! She\\'s found reinforcements! It\\'s time...\\nLucius : Hm? What... What are you doing?\\nSoldier : I thought aid might come, so I hid keys and weapons here.\\nLucius : Oh, I see.\\nSoldier : What are you going to do?\\nLucius : Uh...\\nSoldier : Your master... He\\'s betrayed us. Lucius, I must ask. What will you\\n   do?\\nLucius : I... I want to stop Lord Raven. However... In his current state, I...\\n   doubt he will lend me his ear. And so... I will... wait. I will wait for\\n   Lord Raven here. I\\'m sorry... I cannot fight. ...Please understand.\\nSoldier : I do. Here, these are for you.\\nLucius : For me? Vulnerary and a book of light magic?\\nSoldier : You don\\'t have to fight, just protect yourself. I\\'ve known you only\\n   a short time, but you\\'re a friend. I don\\'t want to see you die.\\nLucius : Thank you... Thank you.\\nSoldier : All right, lads! Open that door!! on our honor as Caelin knights, we\\n   will save the marquess!\\n\\n\\nLet me give you a brief explanation of magic. Magic can be divided into three\\nlarge groups. Anima magic is baded on nature. Its attacks include Fire and\\nThunder. The basic attack of Light is Lightning, while Dark magic uses a spell\\ncalled Flux. Each type of magic has an affinity for other types of magic,\\nsimilar to the weapons triangle. Light is strong vs. dark, dark is strong vs.\\nanima, and anima is strong vs. light. This is the Trinity of Magic. So, a\\nmonk\\'s light magic is strong against a shaman\\'s dark magic. Remember which\\nclass has an advantage over which other class.\\n\\n\\nBernard : I am bernard, Knight Commander of Laus! I would test the might of\\n   those who bested Bauker!\\n\\nBernard : This is a just reward... for Laus\\'s brutality...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : Grandfather! Grandfather! Where...\\nEliwood : Lord Hausen? Where are you?\\nHector : Eliwood. Here, on the throne... It\\'s blood.\\nLyn  : Blood? No! It can\\'t be!!\\nEliwood : Lyndis! Calm down. He might only be injured. Come, let us find him.\\nLyn  : Yes, you\\'re right. I must be calm. There! Over there! There\\'s\\n   someone...\\nEliwood : Who\\'s there? Show yourself!\\nLeila : .....\\nHector : You... Leila!\\nLeila : Yes, it\\'s me, Lord Hector. It\\'s been a long time.\\nEliwood : You know her ?\\nHector : Yes, her name\\'s Leila. She... works for Ostia... All right, she\\'s a\\n   spy.\\nLeila : Lord Eliwood of Pherae and Lady Lyndis of Caelin, correct? I am Leila.\\n   Pleased to make your acquaintance. Lady Lyndis, Marquess Caelin is back\\n   there receiving treatment.\\nLyn  : My grandfather is safe?!\\nLeila : ... His life is yet his own.\\nLyn  : Ah! Father Sky and MOther Earth! I thank you for your mercy!!\\nHector : Leila, what are you doing here?\\nLeila : I... I\\'m following Lord Uther\\'s orders. I\\'m investigating Marquess\\n   Pherae\\'s disappearance.\\nEliwood : My father? What have you learned?\\nLeila : Come with me. We should talk in private.\\nEliwood : .....\\nHector : Huh? Come on, Eliwood.\\nEliwood : Ah...\\nHector : Worrying about things won\\'t change them.\\nEliwood : I know. I\\'m fine. Let\\'s go!\\n\\n\\nLeila : Let me start with my conclusion.\\nEliwood : .....\\nLeila : Marquess Pherae... is alive.\\nHector : Whooooo! Eliwood!\\nLyn  : That\\'s wonderful!\\nEliwood : Are you sure?\\nLeila : I\\'ve been posing as a member of the Black Fang for several months.\\n   That\\'s where I got this information. I believe it is true.\\nEliwood : Black Fang... They\\'re the assassins guild that Erik spoke of.\\nLeila : Yes, we\\'ve known of their existence for quite some time.\\nHector : Explain.\\nLeila : The Black Fang is a guild of assassins founded about ten years ago\\n   by Brendan Reed. They\\'re based in Bern. Their arms reached quickly in\\n   several other countries. Originally, they targeted only nobles who abused\\n   their positions. The masses saw them as chivalrous, defenders of the common\\n   man. Their activities found wide support.\\nHector : Chivalrous...\\nLeila : Then about a year ago, Brendan got married again. Black Fang\\'s\\n   operations have slowly changed since then. Now, they\\'ll take on any target,\\n   no matter how difficult, as long as they\\'re paid. And they\\'re no longer\\n   killing only criminals; anyone is a fair target.\\nLyn  : Is this Black Fang responsible for what\\'s happened to my grandfather?\\nLeila : Yes. We\\'ve learned of a mystery man named Nergal, behind Reed\\'s wife.\\n   It seems the Black Fang is performing secret tasks across Lycia for Nergal.\\n   Nergal\\'s trusted retainer Ephidel is with Marquess Laus. He manipulated\\n   Laus into hatching the rebellion plot against Ostia. The first to answer\\n   Laus\\'s call for rebellion was... Marquess Santaruz.\\nEliwood : Lord Helman... Why would you...\\nHector : .....\\nLeila : Next was Lord Elbert, Marquess Pherae.\\nEliwood : You\\'re telling me that my father endorsed this plan?\\nLeila : I cannot say. I do know that he is with Marquess Laus currently. In\\n   a place called... the Dragon\\'s Gate.\\nEliwood : Dragon\\'s Gate? Where is that?\\nLeila : On an isle called Valor, off the southern coast of Lycia. I apologize,\\n   but that is all the information I have.\\nHector : Of all places to be, Valor... Blast!\\nLyn  : What kind of place is it?\\nEliwood : It\\'s said that those who step onto the island never return. The\\n   common folk call it the Dread Isle. If that\\'s where my father is, however,\\n   I will go and find him. And this \"Dragon\\'s Gate,\" too!\\nHector : I\\'m going with you. I\\'ll tell you right now, you can\\'t stop me.\\nLyn  : I\\'m also going.\\nEliwood : Lyndis, I appreciate your kindness, but... Shouldn\\'t you stay with\\n   Marquess Caelin?\\nLyn  : Laus must be stopped. Otherwise, they might target my grandfather\\n   again. I also wish to help Eliwood\\'s father. Losinga parent... It\\'s an\\n   unbearable pain. It\\'s something I\\'d rather you didn\\'t have to feel yet.\\nEliwood : Lyndis... Hector... Thank you. YOu give me strength.\\nHector : Don\\'t mention it.\\nLyn  : We\\'re friends. It\\'s what friends do, Eliwood.\\nLeila : I\\'m also going to continue searching. Lady Lyndis, I think it would be\\n   prudent to let the world think Marquess Caelin is dead.\\nLyn  : I understand. I\\'ll do that. Thank you.\\nLeila : No thanks necessary. If you\\'ll excuse me.\\nHector : Leila!\\nLeila : Yes?\\nHector : Nergal and this... Ephidel? What are they like?\\nLeila : I\\'ve yet to lay eyes on Nergal. I\\'ve spoken to Ephidel on several\\n   occassions, however. He\\'s... eerie. He always wears a cloak that covers his\\n   face. And yet...\\nHector : What is it?\\nLeila : His eyes glow golden... You can\\'t miss them. They seem... inhuman.\\nEliwood : .....\\n\\nMatthew : Is that you, Leila?\\nLeila : Matthew. It\\'s been a long time.\\nMatthew : What have you been doing? More dangerous work?\\nLeila : We\\'re spies, Matthew. Everything we do is dangerous.\\nMatthew : That\\'s true. So how long do you think this mission\\'s going to last?\\nLeila : My objective is the same as yours: to rescue Marquess Pherae. If\\n   things go well, I\\'ll be in Ostia at the same time as you are.\\nMatthew : Is that so? You need to visit my hometown.\\nLeila : Is this where you were born? Why?\\nMatthew : ... To meet my parents.\\nLeila : Hm? Matthew...\\nMatthew : Ha ha. Well, that\\'s that! See you.\\nLeila : As slippery as ever... Didn\\'t even wait for my reply.\\n\\nSoldier : Lady Lyndis!\\nLyn  : Everyone... I\\'m happy to see you all well. I\\'m going after Marquess\\n   Laus. Protect my grandfather.\\nSoldier : One moment, Lady Lyndis. Please take this jewel before you leave.\\nLyn  : Jewel?\\nSoldier : We were able to move it before Laus\\'s men ransacked our vaults.\\n   We will take care of Lord Hausen. Please, Lady Lyndis, return to us safely.\\nLyn  : I will. Thank you.\\n\\nGot a Red gem.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.16X  CHAPTER SIXTEEN EXTRA : THE PORT OF BADON\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter speaking with the Ostian spy Leila, Eliwood realizes he must travel to\\nValor, the Dread Isle. The small island, located south of Lycia, is said to be\\nhome to the Dragon\\'s Gate. Heading for the southern coast of Caelin, they seek\\npassage in the port of Badon.\\n\\nHector : Listen! We need a boat to Valor!\\nSailor : You want a boat to the Dread Isle? You\\'re mad! No way! Never! There\\'s\\n   no one in this village who\\'ll sail there!\\nLyn  : Please, we\\'re in a hurry. Can you give us passage?\\nEliwood : If you won\\'t help us, can you take us to someone who will? Please.\\nSailor : You must be on urgent business, that\\'s certain. ..... There may be\\n   one way...\\nEliwood : What is it? Tell us, please!\\nSailor : Pirates.\\nLyn  : Eh? Pirates?\\nSailor : Uh-huh. The\\'re fearless, or as close as makes no difference. and\\n   they\\'ll go anywere for a fee. Who knows? They might decide to accept your\\n   mad offer.\\nHector : Pirates... Looks like we\\'ve no choice.\\nLyn  : Are you serious, Hector? Working with pirates? That\\'s unbelievable!\\nHector : You\\'re considering it, aren\\'t you, Eliwood?\\nEliwood : If there\\'s no other way, what else can we do?\\nLyn  : You, too, Eliwood? I\\'ve misjudged you... It\\'s foolishness to trust the\\n   goodwill of pirates! I\\'m finding another way!\\nHector : Why is she so angry?\\nEliwood : I heard that Lyndis\\'s parents were slain by bandits. Bandits at\\n   land, pirates at sea... They\\'re all the same to Lyndis. Lawbreakers and\\n   murderers.\\nHector : I see... My parents died of illness... But I can appreciate her\\n   feelings. Shall we abandon the pirate plan?\\nEliwood : But...\\nSailor : Too bad about the girl, but there\\'s no other way.\\nEliwood : Let\\'s meet the pirates. We can\\'t decide until then.\\nHector : That\\'s true.\\nSailor : That inn over there is a known favorite of the local freebooters.\\n   They\\'re reckless and unpredictable. Best be prepared.\\n\\n\\nFargus : What do you want, whelps? You\\'re here to see me, aren\\'t you?\\nEliwood : You\\'re commander of the pirate armada, aren\\'t you?\\nFargus : Gwah hah hah! \"Commander of the pirate armada!\" I like the sound of\\n   that! Are you lads that naive? Or are you just dumb? Which is it?\\nHector : You insolent...\\nEliwood : Peace, Hector! If I\\'ve insulted you, I apologize. How should I\\n   address you?\\nFargus : Hmph... You don\\'t frighten easily, do you? Well, at least it seems\\n   you\\'re not stupid. \"Captain\" will do, whelp. I\\'m Fargus, captain of the\\n   Davros.\\nEliwood : Fargus... Master Fargus? Or should i call you Captain?\\nFargus : You\\'re not one of my mates. Call me Fargus. Now, what do you want?\\nEliwood : We want to book passage to Valor.\\nFargus : How much will you pay?\\nEliwood : We don\\'t know the current rates. Tell us how much you want.\\nFargus : 100,000 gold.\\nHector : Wait, 100,000 gold?\\nFargus : Well? Will you pay?\\nEliwood : We\\'ve no choice, but we need a little time. We\\'ll get the gold and\\n   return as quickly as possible. Come, Hector.\\nHector : Wa-Wait a moment! Eliwood!\\n\\nHector : Eliwood! Hold on! Where do you think you\\'re going to get 100,000\\n   gold?\\nEliwood : I\\'m sure there\\'s an arena here. We can raise gold somehow...\\nHector : What? You\\'re not serious!?\\nEliwood : We\\'ve no other way, do we?\\nHector : Well, no. Sometimes you surprise me, Eliwood.\\nEliwood : Did you say something, Hector?\\nHector : No, nothing. Let\\'s go earn some gold!\\nDart : Ahoy! Hold your ground, boys!\\nHector : What now? We don\\'t have the money yet.\\nDart : Fool! Of course you don\\'t! I know that. The captain\\'s got a message for\\n   you.\\nEliwood : A message?\\nDart : All of my mates in this village are going to attack you. If you can\\n   beat us all and get to the ship unharmed, he\\'ll give you passage.\\nEliwood : For free? No gold?\\nDart : The captain\\'s a tad off-kilter. He\\'d rather have a bit o\\' fun with you\\n   than take your gold. Smooth sailing to you.\\n\\nDart : Hey, Landlubber! Over here! I\\'m over here!\\nHector : Oh, for... This is a joke, isn\\'t it?\\nEliwood : Looks serious enough. Here we go!\\nDart : Listen! The captain\\'s waiting at the docks. Talk to him, and you\\'re the\\n   winner! Trust me, though... Don\\'t make the mistake of attacking him! You\\n   anger the captain, and there\\'s no turning back! Don\\'t forget!!\\n\\nLyn  : I couldn\\'t find a ship after all. But we have to get to that island...\\n   Looks like I\\'ll have to endure pirates. Hm? What was that? Commotion in the\\n   village?\\nHector : Oh! Lyn! Nice timing. We need your help!\\nLyn  : You\\'re battling the pirates?\\nEliwood : Fighting and... Look, we have to reach the docks and speak to the\\n   captain! This is a test to see whether or not he\\'ll give us passage.\\nLyn  : I don\\'t understand, but... I\\'m here, so let me help!\\n\\nAugury :\\nOh... Oh, my... Things have gotten out of hand, haven\\'t they? Concentrate...\\nGo around... Around is best. You should speak with the locals. You might even\\nmeet someone. Don\\'t waste your time with every single house though.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLucius : Good to see you again, Agung. Our reunion is surely the work of\\n   blessed Elimine. I\\'m most pleased to travel with you once more. Your\\n   commands, please.\\n\\nTavern (22,9)\\nAnna : I heard about your contest with the pirate captain, Fargus. You\\'ve got\\n   nerve, I\\'ll give you that! Let me give you some advice. Don\\'t try to\\n   overpower the pirates. Take the narrow path next to us, and follow the wall\\n   toward the sea. Pass in front of the last house, and stay close to the\\n   sea wall. You should be able to get to Fargus and win your game! Why do I\\n   know all this? Well, my sweetie\\'s a pirate. His name\\'s Jake, and he\\'s the\\n   best. If you see him, tell him Anna\\'s worried about him!\\n\\nVillage (16,6)\\nNPC : This path leads to danger. The pirates are waiting for you. Do you think\\n   it would be better to find another route? You\\'ve risked much to come here.\\n   I can\\'t let you leave empty-handed. Take this axe. What do you think? Nice,\\n   isn\\'t it? However... it\\'s cursed. It\\'s a might weapon, but if one with bad\\n   luck wields it... Oooh! Terrible, terrible, I tell you. Don\\'t use it unless\\n   you have to.\\n\\nVillage (18,9)\\nCanas : Pardon me! I was speaking with an old sailor a few moments ago. He\\n   told me that you\\'re planning to travel to Valor. Is that so? Really? And\\n   that\\'s why you\\'re playing tag with these pirates? ..... I see. In that\\n   case, would you mind if I joined you? My name is Canas. I\\'m a scholar of\\n   sorts... I\\'ve been seeking passage to Valor, but none will take me. My\\n   proposal probably sounds somewhat selfish, no? You should know, I can help\\n   in combat. I\\'ve some skill with a form of elder magic... Some call it dark\\n   magic, a rather biased term, if I must be blunt. But at the very least, I\\n   can take care of myself, and perhaps others.\\n\\nVillage (13,11)\\nNPC  : You\\'re being tested by pirates, with passage to the Dread Isle hanging\\n   in the balance? Here, use this bow. It\\'s a rare beauty, eh? A Sacaean\\n   friend gave it to me, but I can\\'t use it. Don\\'t get yourself killed out\\n   there, OK?\\n\\nVillage (9,10)\\nNPC  : You\\'re a brave soul to come to such a perilous place. Here. You should\\n   have this staff. You can use it to make those whose magical resistances are\\n   weaker than your own fall asleep for a while. Whether it works or not\\n   depends on the skill of the wielder. Ho, yes. Looks like those pirates are\\n   bearing down on you. Maybe this staff will help you get away.\\n\\nVillage (9,3)\\nNPC  : Have you been to the arena yet? It\\'s filled with toughs and bravados.\\n   You can get rich there... All you have to do is wager and win. If you\\'re\\n   beaten, however, you lose both money and life. If you think you\\'re going to\\n   lose, press the B Button to give up. Remember, you can\\'t give up if you\\'re\\n   dead, so don\\'t wait too long.\\n\\nVillage (4,14)\\nNPC  : Are you interested in this sword here? It\\'s called a lancereaver. It\\'s\\n   an incredible sword to take against lances. Still, it is a little weak\\n   against axes. Go ahead, take it. You\\'re going to the Dread Isle, right? If\\n   you want to avoid the pirates, go behind the shop. From there, just head\\n   straight down the alley. Good luck to you.\\n\\n\\nFargus : What mooncalves! I would\\'ve let \\'em sit there if they hadn\\'t come any\\n   closer. Up and at \\'em, mates! Attack!\\n\\n\\nDamian : What an interesting diversion. Maybe we should join in. Lord Eliwood\\n   of Pherae... You don\\'t yet know to fear the Black Fang. Start grieving...\\n   for I will teach you that fear.\\n\\nDamian : You\\'re about to die. Scream if you must.\\n\\nDamian : Gaa...ha... Crow in... triumph... you\\'ve--\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFargus : Aha! You made it, whelps!\\nHector : That was... hard...\\nEliwood : Haa... haa... You\\'ll give us passage now, wont\\' you?\\nFargus : I\\'m a man of the sea. I always keep my word. Are my old eyes lyin\\' to\\n   me? Is this beauty really with you? Gwaa ha ha ha!! My lucky day!\\nLyn  : .....\\nHector : Listen, I know how you feel, but you have to accept it. We\\'ve no\\n   other choice!\\nLyn  : I know that! I haven\\'t said a word, have I?\\n\\nEliwood : We can go to the Dread Isle now.

When we said that we wished\\n   to travel to Valor, the people in the harbor treated us as though we were\\n   mad.\\nFargus : I\\'m sure they did. It is the Dread Isle, after all. If not for good\\n   reason, we wouldn\\'t want to go either.\\nEliwood : And yet... you\\'ve given us free passage. Why is that?\\nFargus : Listen to me, laddie. Men are strange beasts. We can\\'t resist a\\n   challenge. Something appears on the horizon, and we immediately set sail.\\n   Some dreams we conquer, others we abandon. ...I\\'ve grown old. I haven\\'t\\n   had a good challenge in many a year. Then you mooncalves appear seeking\\n   passage to the Dread Isle. I was impressed with your courage. I think you\\n   may be the ones to survive the Dread Isle.\\nEliwood : We won\\'t disappoint you. We will return.\\nFargus : All right. Then we\\'ll weigh anchor and wait for you. Light a signal\\n   fire when you want to return, and we\\'ll pick you up.\\nEliwood : Thank you.\\nDart : Captain! There\\'s a dory adrift to port! It looks like there\\'s someone\\n   aboard. What\\'re your orders?\\nFargus : Bring \\'em aboard. Looks like we\\'ve got a visitor. Odd though, finding\\n   a boat adrift near here...\\nEliwood : Odd? Why is that?\\nFargus : The sea currents in this area... Anything drifting around here\\n   must\\'ve come from the Dread Isle.\\nEliwood : Oh...\\nFargus : Shall we greet our guest?\\n\\nHector : Eliwood! You done talking to old man Fargus?\\nEliwood : You saw us?\\nHector : No, I heard you\\'d gone off with him. You learn anything?\\nEliwood : ...We can trust him. We got lucky, finding him.\\nHector : Hmmm. If you say so.\\nLyn  : Hey, you two! Come here! They\\'ve pulled the dory aboard! I wonder who\\'s\\n   on board. It\\'s... It\\'s a girl!!?\\nDart : ...Uh...uhnn... Oy! You there!\\nLyn  : Me?\\nDart : Give me a hand, will you? I don\\'t know where to... grab her.\\nLyn  : ...OK.\\nHector : Such the gentleman.\\nDart : Stow it!\\n\\nLyn  : Hm? Ninian!? Ninian! Wake up!!\\nEliwood : Unbelievable... What are the chances?\\nHector : Do you know her?\\nEliwood : She\\'s how Lyndis and I met a year back. I rescued Ninian from a band\\n   of villains.\\nLyn  : Please, Ninian! Open your eyes!!\\nNinian : ... ...Ah...\\nLyn  : Ninian, can you hear me?\\nNinian : ... .....Unnn... I.......\\nLyn  : Are you well? Why were you on that boat? Where is Nils? Why wasn\\'t he\\n   with you?\\nNinian : ..... Ah...ah...\\nLyn  : Ninian?\\nEliwood : Lyndis, something\\'s wrong with her.\\nNinian : Who... Who...\\n\\nDart : Captain! Pirate ships approaching from the northwest!\\nFargus : Do they dare attack Captain Fargus and the Davros? They must be mad!\\nDart : What flag are they flying? I\\'ve never seen that pattern before.\\nFargus : These seas belong to us! Whoever they are, they\\'re in our waters!\\n   This is a day for strange occurences, it seems. You whelps watch you own\\n   hides. We\\'ve no time to waste on you!\\n\\nSailor : Uwaaaaaaaaaaa!! Water!!! The hull\\'s been breached! We\\'re taking on\\n   water!!!\\nFargus : Breached? Those scum are more dangerous than I\\'d thought!\\nDart : It\\'s bad, Captain! We need all hands belowdecks, or we\\'ll sink!!!\\nFargus : Take care of it! I\\'m going to carve these scallywags some new\\n   gizzards!\\nSailor : We need your help! The water\\'s up to the galley! You must come below,\\n   Captain!\\nFargus : Grrr...\\nEliwood : Fargus! Leave the enemy to us!\\nHector : Fighting is something we\\'re good at! But a sinking ship? That\\'s your\\n   affair! You have to do something, or we\\'ll all drown!\\nLyn  : We\\'ll deal with things up here. Please! Hurry!\\nFargus : Fine!! The deck is yours! I\\'ll be back as soon as we\\'ve plugged the\\n   breach in the hull!\\nEliwood : Go!\\n\\nEliwood : Lyn! Take here to that room!\\nLyn  : I will.\\nHector : Here they come!\\n\\nZoldam : All we want is the girl. Kill the rest.\\n\\nAugury :\\nStay... still. Choose your ground, and fight where you stand. Danger for\\n...knigths... Armorslayers to the east, magic to the west. ...Heh heh heh.\\nYou\\'ll understand when the fighting starts. Pegasus knights... yes. It\\ncouldn\\'t hurt to have thieves along, either.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nGuy  : Ohhh... I\\'m going to be sick. Doesn\\'t this bother you, Agung? This ship\\n   moves too much... I... I can still fight, though. My sword arm\\'s fine!\\n\\nDart : Ahoy! We\\'ll leave the fighting to you. Hold on until we can help! Oh,\\n   and we\\'ve merchants aboard. This is the armory. This is the shop. You wont\\'\\n   be able to stock up once we reach the Dread Isle. I suggest you buy as much\\n   as possible while you\\'ve the chance!\\n\\n\\nZoldam : Don\\'t worry about any ambush. Board their ship. You don\\'t know how to\\n   fight? Go now, or die here...\\n\\nZoldam : You possess... this much... power...?\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFargus : Ahoy! I\\'m back! Now, who wants to die first? What\\'s this? You\\'ve\\n   routed \\'em already? Nicely done, whelps!\\nHector : Those sea dogs were no match for us!!\\nEliwood : .....\\n\\nLyn  : Ah! Ninian! You can\\'t come out yet! There\\'s blood everywhere!\\nNinian : ...Blood?\\nEliwood : Look out!\\nNinian : ...Ah! I\\'m sorry.\\nEliwood : Are you OK? Ninian?\\nNinian : Ninian? Is that... me? Is that... my name?\\nLyn  : Ninian! What\\'s happened to you...\\nNinian : ...I... My head... is so foggy. Am I... at sea?\\nLyn  : Yes. We found you adrift in a small boat.\\nFargus : Those scum were after the girl, it seems. Will you take her with you?\\n   The men are afraid she, well, she might be cursed, you know?\\nHector : Cursed...?\\nLyn  : Are you suggesting we leave Ninian behind?\\nHector : We can\\'t take her with us, can we? We\\'re heading for the Dread Isle.\\n   It\\'s dread for a reason, you know!\\nLyn  : Regardless... she goes with us!\\nEliwood : Lyndis?\\nLyn  : When I saw her, I remembered something. The last time I saw Ninian...\\n   She and her brother were being hunted by some dark-robed men.\\nHector : Dark-robed? Are you sure?\\nLyn  : Yes, I think it must be the Black Fang. It didn\\'t occur to me before,\\n   but now I\\'m certain.\\nEliwood : How can you be sure?\\nLyn  : I can\\'t explain... There\\'s something in the air that hints at their\\n   involvement.\\nEliwood : If it\\'s true, then she\\'s likely to be attacked again.\\nLyn  : Almost certainly. We can\\'t leave her behind. I will watch over her.\\n   Please...\\nEliwood : I understand. We should be by her side to protect her.\\nLyn  : Thank you.\\nEliwood : We\\'re all going to that island. Will you come with us?\\nNinian : Yes... Please... take me with you.\\n\\nFargus : We\\'ve arrived.\\nEliwood : Thank you very much.\\nFargus : We\\'ll wait two weeks. Finish up by then.\\nHector : That\\'s more than enough time!\\nFargus : And I\\'ve got a half-wit sailor who wants to go sightseeing. C\\'mere,\\n   Dart!\\nDart : I\\'m here, Captain! Ready to serve!\\nEliwood : We\\'re pleased to have you.\\nFargus : His only redeeming feature is his sturdiness. Maybe he\\'ll come in\\n   handy.\\nDart : Come on, Captain! I\\'m better\\'n that!\\nEliwood : You\\'ve done so much. I can\\'t thank you enough...\\nFargus : Come back alive! That\\'s all the thanks I need.\\nEliwood : All right. Farewell!\\nHector : We\\'ll be back before you know it!\\n\\nLyn  : ...There are good people, even among pirates.\\nHector : I don\\'t think the old man and his group are your average pirates.\\nEliwood : Somewhere within that forest is the Dragon\\'s Gate.\\nHector : Eliwood! No matter what it takes, we\\'re coming back with your father!\\nLyn  : ...We\\'ll surely find him. We\\'ll all do our best to make it so.\\nEliwood : You\\'re right. Let\\'s make preparations to enter the forest.\\nHector : Oh!\\nNinian : Dragon\\'s Gate...\\nLyn  : Ninian? What is it?\\nNinian : It\\'s nothing... ...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.18  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN : THE DREAD ISLE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood arrives on the shores of Valor with a new companion in his numbers, an\\nenigmatic young girl named Ninian. The majority of the island is covered in\\ndense forest. Legend has it that no one has ever returned from those dark\\nwoods. A dense fog crawls over the party, engulfing them one by one...\\nCautiously, they move deeper into the trees.\\n\\nDragon\\'s Gate\\nNergal : Shame on you, Marquess Pherae. You freed the boy AND the girl?\\nElbert : I will not let ou move unopposed!\\nDarin : Wh-What shall we do, Lord Nergal? With both siblings gone, we can no\\n   longer hold the ceremony.\\nElbert : How many times must I tell you, Lord Darin? You are being used by\\n   this man!! By helping him bring dragons back into this world, you are\\n   helping him destroy mankind! Do you understand?!?\\nDarin : Pah...ha ha ha... Destroy mankind? Dragons may have been a threat to\\n   mankind in ages past, but with Lord Nergal\\'s power, we\\'ve got nothing to\\n   fear! Lord Nergal can control dragons!!! Ha ha...ha ha ha...\\nElbert : Lord Darin... You\\'re already lost.\\nNergal : I\\'d planned to start a war in Lycia. The war I was plotting in Lycia\\n   would\\'ve generated a glorious amount of FORCE in one blow. You were not\\n   equal to the task, it seems. Not to worry. I\\'ve other means at hand.\\nElbert : Black hearted fiends! Guuuh!!\\nNergal : Hold your tongue. There is still a task you must perform for me.\\n   Ephidel! Limstella! My beloved morphs, my beauteous works of art. I\\'ve new\\n   jobs for you, my pets. First Limstella. You will go to Bern and contact\\n   Sonia. I want you to arrange a meeting with the king.\\nLimstella : Understood.\\nNergal : Ephidel, take this... man, Marquess Laus, and go. I want you to\\n   exterminate the mice who\\'ve landed on the island.\\nEphidel : Yes, master.\\nNergal : That leaves you, Marquess Pherae. It seems your legacy is one of\\n   endurance.\\nElbert : !?\\nNergal : ...The mouse who interfered with my conquest of Lycia is named\\n   Eliwood. Should he be congratulated on making it this far?\\nElbert : Eliwood? My son is here? Stop! Do with me what you will, but let my\\n   son be!\\nNergal : Hm? Heh...Hehahahaha!!! Remember the siblings you freed? The girl\\'s\\n   here, too. As a matter of fact, she\\'s with your son, Eliwood. Quite a\\n   delicious twist of fate, wouldn\\'t you say?\\nElbert : ... This can\\'t be...\\nNergal : Eliwood will die in these woods. The girl will be returned to me, and\\n   the ceremony will take place. Hm... Despite those long hours of torture,\\n   you remain undaunted. Such courage will make you the perfect sacrifice,\\n   Marquess Pherae.\\nElbert : Eliwood... Turn back... Take the girl and flee... ...Please...\\n\\nLeila : I can\\'t believe it\\'s come to this. I must inform Lord hector of these\\n   events... If I hurry, I may be in time. What!?\\nEphidel : Leila... Where are you going?\\nLeila : Lord Ephidel... The sentries... I\\'m going to check on...\\nEphidel : You overheard, did you not? ...And I had such hopes for you. Jaffar!\\nLeila : Ah!!\\nJaffar : The punishment for traitors is death.\\nLeila : !!!!! Aa... ...Ma...Matthew.....\\nEphidel : ...Impressive, Jaffar. Your power is beyond compare.\\nJaffar : .....\\nEphidel : Take this woman\\'s corpse and leave it in the forest. Let it serve as\\n   a warning to those fools.\\n\\nValor Isle\\nLyn  : Let\\'s get through these woods. It\\'s starting to get foggy... Try not to\\n   get separated.\\nHector : \"Enter and be lost.\" It feels like we\\'re not coming back.\\nLyn  : Hector!! Are you trying to curse us?\\nEliwood : Are you well, Ninian?\\nNinian : ...Y-Yes... I\\'m... I\\'ll be fine.\\nEliwood : !? Someone\\'s there!\\nHector : Who? A sentry? Leila! Is that you? Impressive work, finding your way\\n   here!\\nEliwood : ... Something\\'s wrong, Leila? Lei--!!\\nLyn  : She\\'s... dead...\\nNinian : No!\\nHector : ...This can\\'t be. She was one of our best spies, Leila...\\n\\nMatthew : .....\\nHector : ...I\\'m sorry, Matthew.\\nMatthew : ...Why do you apologize, my lord? Leila blundered. ...That\\'s all.\\nEliwood : Matthew... Leila was.. She was...\\nMatthew : After his mission, I was going to ask here to put this life behind\\n   her... Waited too long, didn\\'t I? Ha... ...My lord, might I... rejoin you\\n   later? She has to be buried...\\nHector : ...Of course.\\nLyn  : Ah... I\\'ll go with you...\\nEliwood : ...Let them be alone. There\\'s nothing else we can do...\\nHector : Blast! They put her out here for us to find like this!\\nLyn  : Unforgivable! This is... a fould deed. Beyond foul.\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go. The foe is somewhere in this forest. We must stop this\\n   before any more die!\\n\\nNinian : Ah! ...Beware! Something comes!\\nLyn  : What!? Kyaa!\\nEliwood : Lyndis!!\\nUhai : If you value her life, send the girl to me.\\nNinian : ...Ah.\\nLyn  : You, you\\'re Sacaen!\\nUhai : That\\'s correct... I am Uhai of the Black Fang. I\\'ve been sent to\\n   capture the girl... And to kill the lot of you. If, however... you hand\\n   over the girl and depart the island at once, I\\'ll grant you your lives.\\nLyn  : And if we refuse?\\nUhai : You know nothing, little lord. Nothing of Nergal\\'s might. Nothing of\\n   his terrible power. You are ignorant, and so you hope to oppose him. You\\n   are insects railing against the heavesn. Your actions will change nothing.\\n   Speak no more foolishness and begone!\\nEliwood : ... Maybe we don\\'t know what it is we\\'re fighting... But if we flee,\\n   our loss is assured. So we will continue to struggle, and we may yet\\n   prevail!\\nUhai : ...Folly.\\nLyn  : What! Why are you letting me go?\\nUhai : Holding a woman hostage during battle is shameful. You, too, are of\\n   Sacae, and I\\'ve a mind to show you mercy. I will let you die with a sword\\n   in yourd hands. But rest assured... I will kill you all here. But be of\\n   good cheer! In dying, you shall all be spared the calamity that is to come!\\nNinian : .....\\nEliwood : Ninian, you must hide. We will meet the enemy!\\n\\nAugury :\\nWhat!? You\\'d take an old woman to the Dread isle!? Oh, who are you to wish\\nsuch a terrible thing on me? You should be more careful of the demands you\\nmake on this weary old frame, yes? Oh, aye, the augury... Yes, yes. Of course.\\n\\n...Hmph! Fog! You should take thieves with you... and torches will make things\\neasier, too. I sense the foe has a strange item... watch you possessions\\nclosely,,, Take the orchid-haired sky rider... There is someone she should\\nmeet.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDart : You\\'re Agung, right? I\\'m Dart, leader of Fargus\\'s suicide squad! The\\n   captain\\'s ordered me to follow your commands. So, who do you want me to\\n   take care of?\\n\\nMatthew : I\\'m back, my lord!\\nHector : Matthew! Are you sure? You don\\'t have to--\\nMatthew : What are you talking about? Look at this eerie place, this thick\\n   fog... This is exactly why you brought me with you.\\nHector : Yet...\\nMatthew : If Leila... If Leila knew I was shirking my duties, she would never\\n   have forgiven me. I\\'m fine. I will work twice as hard for Ostia in her\\n   honor.\\nHector : I understand... I\\'m counting on you!\\nMatthew : As well you should, my lord! Tell me, Leila... This is what you\\'d\\n   want, right? You wouldn\\'t want me to give up. I\\'ll mourn for you when our\\n   batle is won. I must fulfill my duty. So rest... I promise I will take\\n   care of everything.\\n\\n\\nFiora : I found them... These men are Black Fang... Look, everyone. Your\\n   sacrifices were not in vain. I\\'ll fulfill our duty, even if I must do it\\n   myself. I am a true knight of Ilia!\\n\\n\\nUhai : I am Uhai! I am the Soaring Hawk! Come!\\n\\nEliwood : I\\'m searching for my father. If you are determined to block our\\n   progress... Then you shall be moved!!\\nUhai : Do your worst!\\n\\nLyn  : ... How can a proud man like you live as an assassin?\\nUhai : ... I symphatize with Brendan Reed\\'s ideology. He wants to help the\\n   weak, to break the overly proud... Discussing this philosophy with Breandan\\n   and his sons, training together, getting stronger together... For me, the\\n   Black Fang was the first place... that felt like home.\\nLyn  : \"Felt\"? Is that feeling gone?\\nUhai : The Black Fang has changed. Nergal sent that woman... ...But it\\'s too\\n   late for me to change now.\\nLyn  : Why? Talk to us, we may be able to help.\\nUhai : Expect no quarter merely because we are both nomads. Prepare yourself!\\n\\nUhai : Oh.. So, you\\'re from Sacae, too, are you?\\nGuy  : I am Guy of the Kutolah!\\nUhai : Kutolah... The Ash Wolf, Dayan\\'s tribe! They\\'re said to be the\\n   strongest on the plains. But you\\'re still a child. Do you fight like one?\\nGuy  : No!\\nUhai : Then show me. Come!\\n\\n\\nUhai : Guuu... Well...done....... You are... stronger... stronger than I\\n   expected. Out of respect... ...a final gift from me... From here, go south.\\n   ...Turn at the rotted tree. Head... west. There lies the path to the...\\n   ...Dragon\\'s Gate... Unnh...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Uhai... I wish we could\\'ve met under different circumstances.\\nHector : ...Do we trust him?\\nLyn  : He was a Sacaen. He would not lie. ...I, at least, choose to believe\\n   him.\\nHector : ...Let\\'s go then.\\nEliwood : To the Dragon\\'s Gate!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.18X CHAPTER EIGHTEEN EXTRA : IMPRISONER OF MAGIC\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWith Uhai\\'s dying words still sounding in their ears, they venture deep into\\nthe forest\\'s heart. Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious not to alert any\\nhidden enemy. However, following on her path, a new Black Fang shadow appears.\\n\\nEliwood : A great, rotted tree. This would appear to be the place of which\\n   Uhai spoke.\\nLyn  : So if we move west from here, we\\'ll reach the Dragon\\'s Gate, right?\\nHector : OK, let\\'s go!\\nEliwood : .....\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, are you well? You have a pallid look about you...\\nEliwood : ...Oh, it\\'s you, Marcus.\\nMarcus : Is something amiss?\\nEliwood : You heard what Erik said when we were in Laus, Marcus... What do you\\n   think?\\nMarcus : That Lord Elbert was involved in a rebellion plot?\\nEliwood : Yes.\\nMarcus : It must be a mistake. Your father is loyal to Lycia. He\\'d never break\\n   his oath.\\nEliwood : You\\'re right. I can\\'t believe he\\'d be involved in this conspiracy.\\n   Yet... why do I feel so anxious? When I think of my father, I can\\'t catch\\n   my breath.\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood, do not mistake your feelings. That feeling that strikes\\n   you when you think of Lord Elbert? It springs not from a distrustful heart.\\n   It comes from concern for your father, who needs your help. He is involved\\n   in someting larger than all of us. This is all happening so fast; it\\'s easy\\n   to lose sight of that.\\nEliwood : I see... You... You\\'re right. ...Thank you, Marcus. I feel a bit\\n   better.\\nMarcus : I\\'m glad to be of service. Bah. The air on this accursed isle... It\\'s\\n   disquieting.\\nEliwood : ...It feeds the despair already lurking in our hearts. If you hadn\\'t\\n   been here for me, Marcus, I--\\nMarcus : Eh? Something is happening ahead.\\nEliwood : It\\'s Hector. Let\\'s go!\\n\\nLyn  : Stop yelling at me! It\\'s because of that clattering armor you\\'re\\n   wearing! I\\'m just saying we have to move cautiously. Nothing more!\\nHector : I know! and I\\'m saying that I\\'m doing my best!\\nEliwood : Quiet, both of you! Armor or no, if you two keep shouting like that,\\n   every enemy from here to Pherae itself will hear us!\\nLyn  : Ah...\\nHector : Sorry.\\nEliwood : We must proceed with caution. I can\\'t believe Uhai was the only\\n   Black Fang in these woods.\\n\\nAssassin : Lord Aion, we\\'ve received word from the pegasus unit. Targets are\\n   approaching from the far side of that mountain to the east.\\nAion : Hmph... Uhai must have failed after all. I\\'m not surprised. We\\'re\\n   talking about the shallow wisdom of a Sacaen nomad, after all. He possessed\\n   a certain rough talet, but no mind for planning. Our units are in place,\\n   are they not?\\nAssassin : Yes.\\nAion : Ha ha... Good. Very good. In confined spaces like this, my thunder\\n   magic devastates. The battle has already been won... I cannot lose. Combat\\n   is an equation. Those with intelligence have a natural advantage. Those\\n   imbecile will not reach the Dragon\\'s Gate. Never. I will bury them here in\\n   this forest!\\n\\nEliwood : I can see ruins. Is that the Dragon\\'s Gate?\\nNinian : .....\\nEliwood : Ninian? Are you all right?\\nNinian : ...Beware! .....The enemy comes!\\nEliwood : Enemy?\\nShaman : Eliwood of Pherae! Prepare yourself!\\nEliwood : Oof!! We won\\'t reach the Dragon\\'s Gate if we stay on the defensive.\\n   Hit their commander, and attack the ruins!\\n\\nAugury :\\n...Mmm... .....You must beware magical attacks... They will not attack from\\nthe front... If you wait, though... something may happen. For good or for ill,\\nthat I cannot say. Ah, I can see no more.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRuins (19,3):\\nMarcus : Oh! Who\\'s there!? What are you doing?\\nRenault : I\\'m Renault. I\\'m on a pilgrimage.\\nMarcus : So you\\'re a bishop!? Forgive my rudeness...\\nRenault : What are you doing here? You don\\'t appear to be with the black-robed\\n   group I saw earlier.\\nMarcus : No, we stand opposed to them. ...This is a battleground. We can\\'t let\\n   you get caught up in our fight. You should stay here, out of sight.\\nRenault : I\\'m sure that I cannot convince you to lay down your arms. That\\n   being the case, I give you this.\\nMarcus : This...\\nRenault : It may help you live longer. Even if you face the misery of defeat\\n   in combat, you might yet find another road if you but live.\\nMarcus : You have my gratitude.\\nRenault : May you be watched over and protected in your venture.\\nMarcus : Hm. Blessings upon you, too.\\n\\nEnd of Turn 3 :\\nKishuna : ..........\\nAion : Wha-What?! The magic power of this place... The source is... distorted\\n   ... I...

Thunder, hear my cry!\\n\\nAion : This can\\'t be... happening...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Is everyone well?\\nHector : yes, somehow.\\nLyn  : Eliwood, I\\'m sorry. I said things I shouldn\\'t have.\\nHector : No, I was shouting without thinking. I was wrong. Forgive me.\\nLyn  : No, it was my fault. If I hadn\\'t...\\nEliwood : It\\'s no one\\'s fault. There\\'s an eerie power here.\\nHector : Eerie power?\\nEliwood : I don\\'t feel it any longer, but... It was meant to make us uneasy.\\n   Was it connected to that area where magic was nullified?\\nLyn  : Now that you mention it, I was so irritable... I couldn\\'t let even the\\n   smallest thing go by without complaining. ...What could that have been?\\n   The Black Fang couldn\\'t use magic either. So it wasn\\'t an ally of theirs...\\nEliwood : Who knows?\\nHector : It\\'s gone now, so no sense in worrying about it. We should\\n   concentrate on pushing forward.\\nEliwood : Hmm. Let\\'s make haste to the Dragon\\'s Gate.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.19  CHAPTER NINETEEN : DRAGON\\'S GATE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFollowing Uhai\\'s last words, Eliwood ventures toward the heart of the forest.\\nHe is greeted by an extraordinary sight. A building unlike any he\\'s ever seen.\\nIt was clearly not wrought by human hands... It is wating... waiting for the\\nmasters who abandoned it centuries past. Massive beyond belief, these ancient\\nruins have nothing to do with humankind. Eliwood has arrived. He has found\\nthe Dragon\\'s Gate.\\n\\nEliwood : ...We\\'re here. The Dragon\\'s Gate...\\nNinian : .....\\nEliwood : What\\'s wrong, Ninian? You\\'re trembling.\\nNinian : ...This place... so frightening. Something... powerful...\\nLyn  : It\\'s her power, isn\\'t it?\\nHector : Her power? What\\'s that?\\nLyn  : Ninian has the ability to sense impending danger. Her memory may be\\n   gone, but her power remains.\\nEliwood : What is it you sense, Ninian?\\nNinian : I... should not have... come here. Something awful will happen if I\\'m\\n   here. Ah!!\\nEliwood : Ninian!? Snap out of it!\\nNinian : This place... No... I...I...\\nEliwood : She\\'s getting worse! Let\\'s get her away from here!\\n\\nEphidel : You\\'ll not be going anywhere. That little bird has escaped this\\n   island cage twice. Now that she\\'s back, she\\'ll not be allowed to fly away\\n   again.\\nEliwood : Who are you!?\\nEphidel : We meet at last. I am Ephidel. Pleased to make your acquaintance.\\nHector : You\\'re Ephidel? I\\'ve been looking forward to this.\\nEphidel : ...Gallantly spoken. Of course, I know who you are. Marquess Ostia\\'s\\n   younger brother, Lord Hector. And here we have Caelin\\'s beloved princess,\\n   Lady Lyndis.\\nLyn  : .....\\nEphidel : By the way, the gift I left for you in the forest... Was it to your\\n   liking? The corpse of that filthy red-haired traitor?\\nHector : Monster! Stay right there! I\\'m going to crush the life from you with\\n   my bare hands.\\nEphidel : Now I see! She was an Ostian spy, wasn\\'t she? Don\\'t worry, she did\\n   not suffer. It only took one blow.\\nHector : Die!!\\nEliwood : he vanished!!\\n\\nNinian : Wha--!?\\nEphidel : This girl is needed for my master\\'s ceremony.\\nEliwood : Ninian!\\nNinian : Lord Eliwood! Let me go!\\n\\nLyn  : Vanished...\\nHector : Blast!!\\n\\nDarin : Lord Ephidel! Is the girl with you?\\nEphidel : As you can see...\\nDarin : Oho! The ritual can take place at last!\\nEphidel : Yes. However, we have an infestation of mice to deal with... They\\n   should be scurrying in here momentarily. They must be dealt with before\\n   the ritual takes place. May I entrust this task to you?\\nDarin : Of course. Who do you think I am?! I am Darin, Marquess Laus! Ruler\\n   of this world!\\nEphidel : Very well. I leave it to you.\\nDarin : Ruler of the world... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\\nEphidel : Humans... They are so very fragile.\\n\\nNergal : Ah... you\\'ve done well. Precious Ephidel. Shall we prepare for the\\n   ritual?\\nElbert : Nergal!!\\nNergal : Does it gall you, Marquess Pherae? It\\'s destiny. There could be no\\n   other outcome. Despite all of your mischief, the girl was fated to return\\n   to me.\\nElbert : My son... Where is Eliwood?\\nNergal : He\\'s still alive. Of course, it\\'s only a matter of time before the\\n   Black Fang finishes him.\\nElbert : ...Nergal! Prepare to die!!\\nNergal : Eh!?\\nJaffar : ...\\nElbert : Urrgg... grrr...haa...!!\\nNergal : ...That was a surprise. When did he undo his bonds? Heh heh... Why\\n   do you not heed my warnings, Lord Elbert? You cannot alter destiny. Stop\\n   this foolishness.\\nElbert : ...Urrgg... grraa...\\nNergal : Jaffar, take Marquess Pheraeand the girl to the far chamber. I will\\n   begin preparations for the ritual.\\nJaffar : Thy will be done.\\n\\nCameron : I\\'ve been waiting for you, son of Pherae.\\nEliwood : Where is my father?\\nCameron : Inside... He\\'s farther inside. You will never see him, though.\\n   Even if you break through here, the path you seek is guarded by Marquess\\n   Laus. Will you not withdraw? It\\'s too late for that, isn\\'t it? You\\'ll never\\n   leave here alive. Ha ha ha ha ha!\\n\\n\\nAugury :\\n...Aha... Powerful foes everywhere. Leave those with timid hearts behind.\\n...Strong defense... and those with distance attacks. Those would be good to\\nhave. And... rapiers, armorslayers... magic... These things you need.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSain : Agung! The final battle is approaching. That traitor, Laus... He harmed\\n   Lord Hausen, caused grief to Lady Lyndis... As a true knight of Caelin, I\\n   will make him pay! Leave him to me!!\\n\\n\\nNPC  : Hey, you! What are youdoing there?!\\nLegault : What am I doing? Is that a proper greeting? If you don\\'t know me,\\n   you must be a new recruit, yes?\\nNPC  : Uh... I was assigned to the Dragon\\'s Gate about one month ago.\\nLegault : I though as much. I am Legault. You\\'ve heard my name, yes?\\nNPC  : Legault.. Ah! You... You\\'re the Hurricane? Second in ability to none\\n   but the Four Fangs?\\nLegault : Yes, yes. That\\'s me.\\nNPC  : I... I beg your pardon.\\nLegault : No worries. ...Now then, time to fill my purse with treasure and\\n   leave the Black Fang behind. No sense staying on a sinking ship. No sense\\n   at all.\\n\\nFight with Lyn :\\nLyn  : Are you Darin? My grandfather... You tried to...\\nDarin : What? Who are you?\\nLyn  : I am Marquess Caelin\\'s granddaughter, Lyndis!\\nDarin : Oh... that senile fool? ...That doddering wreck dared disagree with\\n   me... I was so happy to be rid of him.\\nLyn  : You\\'re a dead man!\\n\\nFight with Eliwood :\\nEliwood : Darin! Your treachery ends here!!\\nDarin : Ha ha ha ha. I will never fall to the likes of you!!\\n\\nFight with Hector :\\nDarin : Oh... You\\'re Marquess Ostia\\'s younger brother...\\nHector : I couldn\\'t care less if you\\'ve a grudge against Ostia. I\\'ll put up\\n   with your treachery no longer!\\nDarin : Heh Heh heh... Ostia is no longer my main concern... Nor is the whole\\n   of Lycia... The only goal worthy of my attention is the entire world!\\nHector : You\\'re mad!!\\n\\nStandard fight text :\\nDarin : Hah...hah ha ha! You dare challenge me? I, who will rule the world!?\\n\\n\\nDarin : Blood? Is this... my blood? Ephidel! Come to me!! Your master... calls\\n   you! I am the ruler... of... the... world...\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nLyn  : He was mad.\\nHector : Consumed by his own lust... Pitiful fool.\\nEliwood : ...Lord Darin.\\nHector : C\\'mon, Eliwood! This is no time for sentiment.\\nLyn  : Your father needs you!\\nEliwood : ...Let\\'s go!\\n\\nEliwood : Father! Father!? It\\'s me! Eliwood!! I\\'ve come to save you! \\n  ...Father?\\nHector : It\\'s dark in here. Can\\'t see a thing...\\nElbert : Eli... Eliwood...\\nEliwood : Ah!!\\n\\nEliwood : Father! Where are you?\\nLyn  : Back there! Eliwood!! His voice is coming from back there!!\\n\\nEliwood : Ah! Father! You... You\\'re all right...\\nElbert : Eliwood... Wait! For-Forget me! Take that girl and flee!\\n\\nEliwood : Ninian?!\\nNinian : .....\\nElbert : That girl... She\\'s the key to the Dragon\\'s Gate. Hurry! Go, before\\n   Nergal notices you!\\nEliwood : Ninian! This way! We must flee!\\nNinian : .....\\nLyn  : Something\\'s wrong with her... Yet we\\'ve not time to hesitate.\\nHector : Eliwood! I\\'ve got your father! You take Ninian!\\nEliwood : I understand!\\n\\nHector : Lord Elbert! I\\'m going to move you a little. Be strong.\\nElbert : Hector... you came, too? ...Thank you.\\nHector : Don\\'t worry about that. Come, let\\'s leave this place.\\nLyn  : Eliwood! Hector!! Hurry! This way!! Ah!!\\n\\nJaffar : ..... You will not pass here.\\nLyn  : When did you?\\nElbert : You must not fight that man!!\\nLyn  : What!?\\nElbert : That man... is dangerous. You cannot defeat him on your own.\\nEliwood : Father, there\\'s no time. This danger must be faced.\\nEphidel : ...Be a good boy, and listen to your father, young master Eliwood.\\nEliwood : Ephidel!!!\\nEphidel : Even among the Black Fang, this man is feared for his skill... You\\n   are no match for him, not even as a group. ...You\\'ve done well, Jaffar.\\n   That is all. Return to Bern and begin your next assignment.\\nJaffar : .....\\nEphidel : Hear my word! I have an invitation from my master. In honor of your\\n   hard-fought arrival, he\\'s prepared a special show for you.\\nElbert : Stop it! You cannot release the dragons!!!\\nEliwood : Father? What\\'s all this about?\\nEphidel : ...You will know shortly. At the expense of your father\\'s life!\\n\\nElbert : Guwaah! ...Gaa...ghaa...\\nEliwood : Father! What\\'s wrong? Father!\\nHector : Lord Elbert! Hold on!\\nEliwood : Huh? ...Ninian?\\nNinian : Pow...pow...er... ...power...\\nElbert : Gahaaa!\\nEliwood : Father!!!\\nNergal : Now, Ninian... at last. Open the Dragon\\'s Gate.\\nNinian : ...Gate... Open...gate...\\nNergal : Yes... that\\'s it... This way, dragon...\\nHector : Whoa! What\\'s... What\\'s this rumbling!?\\nLyn  : Unh! I can barely keep my feet!\\nEliwood : Nergal... What... What\\'s happening!?\\nNinian : Here... Come, children of... flame. Come... to me...\\nHector : ...It can\\'t be.\\nLyn  : Ah... No... It isn\\'t...\\nEliwood : Is that... trully....... a dragon?\\nNergal: Ha ha ha ha ha! Yes! Use all your strength! Squeeze every drop from\\n   your body! You will call dragons!\\n?? : ... I will not allow this!!\\n\\nEphidel : Who\\'s there?! ...You!\\nLyn  : Nils!\\nNils : Ninian! Come to your senses! You must not do what they want!\\nNinian : ...Ni... .....Nils...\\nNergal : Nils? Not now! Grrr ...Ehpidel! Stop him!!\\nEphidel : Desist, Nils! The power... It runs wild!!\\nNils : Ninian!!\\nNinian : ..... ...Nils?\\nNils : Here! Hurry!! The dragon is crumbling. Everyone flee!!\\nNergal : .....\\nEphidel : Hyaaaa! Stop... You mustn\\'t come here!! Lord Nergal! Lord Nergal!\\n   Please.....!!! Guwaaaaaahhh!!!!!!\\nHector : ...Something...happened.\\nEliwood : Is it... gone?\\n\\nNergal : No! I\\'ve failed! Nils, you whelp! If not for your interference...\\n   ...Come! Both of you!\\nNinian : What? No!\\nNils : Never! We will not follow you!!\\nEliwood : Ninian! Nils!\\nNergal : Eh!!\\nElbert : You will...not!\\nNergal : What!? ...Impossible... Not... by your hand...\\nElbert : ...I told you. I will...oppose... you always.....\\nNergal : ...Why... won\\'t... you... die? Nnn...\\nEliwood : Father!!\\nElbert : ...Eliwood. Be prepared. He will return...\\nEliwood : All right, but for now... Let\\'s leave this island... Let\\'s go home.\\nElbert : No, my son... I\\'m done here. You, Eliwood... You must finish this.\\nEliwood : Don\\'t say that! Mother is waiting in Pherae... She\\'s waiting for\\n   you, Father!\\nElbert : Ah... Eleanora... She will be cross with me. Eliwood... Your\\n   mother... I\\'m sorry... Tell her... I\\'m... sorry...\\nEliwood : Father?\\n\\nEliwood : no... Please, not now... Not after all we\\'ve done to find you\\n   again... Father... Please... Open your eyes..... Faaatherrrrrrrr!!!!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.20  CHAPTER TWENTY : NEW RESOLVE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt last, Eliwood\\'s long-awaited reunion with his father, as well as their\\npainful farewll. After escaping the Dread Isle, they return to the port city\\nof Badon. Eliwood remains silent for the duration of their passage. He sits\\ncradling his father\\'s cold hand as if to warm him back to life.\\n\\nLyn  : ...Ninian, are you feeling better?\\nNinian : Yes...\\nLyn  : That\\'s good. ...Long time, no see, Nils. You\\'ve grown, haven\\'t you?\\nNils : ...Is it really you, Lyndis? It seems like it\\'s been so long.\\nLyn  : Even though it\\'s only been a year since I saw you last?\\nNils : So much has happened since we left you and Caelin.\\nHector : Hey, care to talk about things the rest of us can follow?\\nNils : Hmph. Who\\'s he?\\nLyn  : This is Hector. He\\'s Marquess Ostia\\'s brother. Don\\'t let his attitude\\n   fool you. He acts mean, but he\\'s decent enough.\\nHector : \"Acts mean\" seems pretty mean to me!\\nLyn  : Heehee... And you might remember this one. He\\'s...\\nNils : Yep, I remember. He\\'s the man who helped Ninian. You\\'re Elbert\\'s son,\\n   aren\\'t you? Your red hair, entle eyes, and even voice. You\\'re just like\\n   him.\\nEliwood : Where did you meet my father?\\nNils : At the Dragon\\'s Gate. He set up free after we\\'d been captured. We\\n   escaped in a small boat, but I was thrown out in a storm. When i woke up,\\n   I was back on Valor. For a time, I hid in the ruins by myself. Then... I\\n   sensed something really dangerous. When I raced to the Dragon\\'s Gate,\\n   I... I saw everything.\\nNinian : ...Nils.\\nLyn  : When we pulled Ninian from the bot, she\\'d lost her memory. I can\\'t\\n   believe we brought her right back to her captors. What a horrible thing\\n   to do. .....I\\'m sorry.\\nNinian : Lady Lyn... Lady Lyn, you did nothing wrong..... When Nils fell\\n   overboard, I didn\\'t know what to do. ...I became lost within myself. If\\n   only I\\'d been stronger... .....All of this could have been avoided... I\\n   am truly... sorry.\\nNils : ...Ninian\\'s power is greater than mine, but it costs her physical and\\n   emotional strength. .....Nergal exploited that... weakness...\\nLyn  : ...Ninian ...Nils...\\nEliwood : ...Was he after you because you have the power to call dragons?\\nNils : ...I think it\\'s because we can open the Dragon\\'s Gate. Just calling\\n   them? Nergal can do that on his own.\\nHector : Are you serious?\\nNils : Yes, but it requires a tremendous amount of quintessence.\\nLyn  : Quintessence?\\nNils : That\\'s what Nergal called it. The substance of the human spirit...\\n   Power. Energy. The essence of life itself. ...Nergal, he stole this\\n   quintessence.\\nHector : ...What happens to those whose quintessence is stolen?\\nNils : ...They... They die...\\nLyn  : .....\\nNils : Neither Ninian nor I have that power. Lyn knows. We only have our\\n   special power... Anyway, Nergal needed to gather a large amount of\\n   quintessence. So he sent his henchman, Ephidel, to get close to Marquess\\n   Laus. He sought to plant the seeds of war in Darin\\'s power-hungry heart.\\nEliwood : ...To what end?\\nNils : It seems the quintessence in each person varies in strength. A person\\n   of strong mind and body has hundreds of times more energy than the average\\n   person. It sounds like there aren\\'t many people like that, though. It took\\n   too long for Nergal to find people with enough strength. Althoug it would\\n   take time, Nergal said the easiest way to get that much quintessence was by\\n   starting a war.\\nHector : ...So he planned to make up for quality with quantity? Is that it?\\n   Black-hearted fiend! Are all men nothing but pawns to him?\\nNils : ...Ephidel brought Elbert to the Dragon\\'s Gate. He said he\\'d found the\\n   ideal source they had sought. Nergal\\'s plans for war had been stopped, and\\n   yet... he was happy. He\\'d taken so much energy from the knights traveling\\n   with Elbert. He was sure he\\'d get even better quintessence from Elbert...\\nLyn  : Nils!\\nNils : Oh, I\\'m sorry... Lord Eliwood.\\nEliwood : It\\'s all right... ...When I found my father at the Dragon\\'s Gate, I\\n   knew his knights were no longer alive...\\nHector : Eliwood...\\nNils : ...Your father told us that he had a son. He said you were blessed with\\n   natural fighting ability. But he also told us you were compassionate and\\n   disdained fighting. He told us that his son would be a better ruler than he\\n   was.\\nLyn  : .....\\nNils : He told us that he would sooner sacrifice himself than see his\\n   homeland, Lycia, embroiled in the flames of war.\\nEliwood : ...That\\'s...\\nNils : When we\\'d lost all hope at the Dragon\\'s Gate, your father always spoke\\n   to us of happy things. ...Well, he mainly spoke of his cherished son and\\n   his dear wife, but Ninian and I... We loved him very much. His stories\\n   about his family... ...They saved us.\\nEliwood : Oh, Fa-- ...Father... .....\\nHector : ...\\nLyn  : ... Hector?\\nHector : We should let him be alone for a while...\\nLyn  : ...Sure. Come on, Ninian, Nils.\\nNils : ...As you say.\\nNinian : ...Lord Eliwood...\\nEliwood : Hm? Ninian... I didn\\'t see you. I\\'m so sorry about before, I just...\\n   needed some time to think.\\nNinian : ...\\nEliwood : Should you be up? You\\'ve had a rough time... Your coloring\\'s not\\n   very good. You should rest.\\nNinian : ...\\nEliwood : ...Look at you, all scratches and bruises... You need to be properly\\n   taken care of...\\nNinian : ...Why?\\nEliwood : Hm?\\nNinian : Why was Lord Elbert so... Lord Eliwood, whywere you both... so kind\\n   to us? It\\'s... This is... This is all my fault... These nightmares... All\\n   these terrible things...\\nEliwood : Ninian, crying ill suits a girl of your beauty. I\\'m fine... Please\\n   don\\'t cry.\\nNinian : I\\'m sorry... So... sorry...\\nEliwood : There\\'s something you must hear. You\\'re not responsible for what\\n   happened to my father. You suffered as much as he did. Please don\\'t punish\\n   yourself further.\\nNinian : ...Lord Eliwood... I... I... Ah!!\\nEliwood : Huh? What is it?\\nNinian : ...Oh...\\nEliwood : Ninian?\\nNinian : ...Enemies... .....Enemies draw near!!\\n\\nHector : So, what do we do now?\\nLyn  : I wonder what happened to Nergal. Lord Elbert gave him a grievous wound\\n   when he stabbed him.\\nNils : His wounds will not kill him.\\nHector : That\\'s what Lord Elbert said, too. Do you know what he meant?\\nNils : ...Nergal uses quintessence on himself as well. His wounds heal\\n   quickly. ...HIs body does not age.\\nLyn  : So he isn\\'t... human?\\nNils : ...If nothing else, he\\'s... Ah!!\\nHector : What is it?\\nNils : Call everyone! Enemies approach!\\nHector : Bah. Eliwood deserves a little more time to rest...\\nLyn  : Well then, we\\'ll handle this ourselves, shall we?\\nEliwood : Here you all are!\\nHector : Ah!\\nLyn  : Eliwood!\\nEliwood : Listen! Get ready for battle! I want to get this over with quickly\\n   to protect villagers. Meet the enemy commander, and drive them out of\\n   here!!\\nHector : Hey, little guy! Go hide in the village!\\nNils : No way! I can help you out!\\nLyn  : Nils, you really are a big help, but... shouldn\\'t you be with Ninian\\n   now?\\nNils : Ah... All right!\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go!\\n\\nAugury :\\nThis battle will be fought in darkness, so thieves are good. Torches or\\nlight-bringing staves are also good. Bow wielders... Archers or snipers should\\ncome along. Antitoxin... the Sleep staff. These are heartening items.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNils : Ninian! Stop! Where are you going?\\nNinian : I... I\\'m going to help!\\nNils : OH, no, you\\'re not! You\\'re still too weak!\\nNinian : But... I merely wish to help Lord Eliwood... Even if just a little.\\n   I... I stole his father\\'s life from him... ...I know this... this will\\n   never make up for it... Nils! Please...\\nNils : ...I understand. Give me your hands.\\nNinian : Nils?\\nNils : I\\'ll give you some of my power. You\\'ll just get in the way if you go\\n   out like this.\\nNinian : Nils, I\\'m sorry.\\nNils : ...Whew! That should do it. Help them for me, too.\\nNinian : Thank you.\\n\\nNinian : Lord Eliwood!\\nEliwood : Ninian!? You shouldn\\'t be here!!\\nNinian : ...Please allow me to help.\\nEliwood : Help? I\\'ve no intention of making you fight...\\nNinian : ...I\\'m no mere dancer. My dances... They will help you.\\n\\n(Execute Nini\\'s Grace)\\n\\nEliwood : ...This is..... I\\'m wrapped in... some sort of... energy...\\nNinian : I used Nini\\'s Grace and danced for you, Lord Eliwood. It will only\\n   last a short while, but while it does, you are protected. ...Please...\\n   allow me... to remain at your side.\\nEliwood : Ninian... Of course. If it will make you feel better. Let\\'s rejoin\\n   the battle. Don\\'t leave my side.\\nNinian : OK! Agung, please tell me what you want me to do. I cannot fight,\\n   but... I can aid with my dance. I ask for your understanding and\\n   assistance.\\n\\nVillage (2,6)\\nNPC  : Can\\'t believe Badon\\'s under attack. If only Fargus were here... Say,\\n   I\\'ve got something here you can use to buy some time. Set this Light Rune,\\n   and it\\'ll block the enemies\\' advance. Only thing is, it\\'ll stop allies,\\n   too. So... watch your step!\\n\\nVillage (4,9)\\nNPC  : Why all the noise? It\\'s the middle of the night!! What? A fight? Are\\n   you going to do something? Really? Then... here, take this. It should aid\\n   you. It\\'s a Restore staff. It\\'ll wake you from sleep and cure poison.\\n   Basically, it\\'ll cure what\\'s wrong and bring you back to normal. Now I\\'m\\n   tired... Why can\\'t you people fight at a decent hour?\\n\\nVillage (8,13)\\nNPC  : Ah... Those emeral eyes, that lustrous blue hair... She was... so\\n   beautiful, beautiful beyond words... If only I could see her again... A\\n   lovely knight of Pherae, searching for her lord... ...I wonder why she\\'s\\n   a knight. A famed knight and me, that\\'s a dream of a dream... Wah! You...\\n   I... I was just thinking out loud... You... didn\\'t hear anything, did you?\\n   Waaaaaaaaa! You mustn\\'t tell anyone! Promise me! You mustn\\'t!!\\n\\nVillage (12,4)\\nNPC  : Are you a mercenary? You all look like you\\'ve been fighting for years\\n   and years. What kind of tactician would put together a group like yours?\\n\\nVillage (18,4)\\nNPC  : Hey! Wasn\\'t that a wyvern rider that flew by here a while back!? I want\\n   to know what Bern\\'s wyvern riders are doing here! Are we under attack?\\n   C\\'mon, do something! I\\'ve heard that wyvern riders are fast and really\\n   tough. Sure, arrows and magic can bring them down, but... This\\'ll cause \\'em\\n   trouble, too! It\\'s a wyrmslayer. Here! Take care of \\'em!\\n\\nVillage (20,14)\\nNPC  : You need special items to change classes. The item\\'s different for\\n   different units, too. Cavaliers and knights need a Knight crest. Folks\\n   skilled in magic and staves need a Guiding Ring. And wyvern riders and\\n   Pegasus knight need this: an Elysian Whip. You can have it. Don\\'t be shy\\n   now. It\\'s not like I\\'ll ever be able to use it. Now, if I were a cute\\n   little Pegasus knight, I\\'d use it in an instant!\\n\\n\\nOleg : It ends here. Your journey is over, and only oblivion awaits you.\\n\\nEliwood : ...Black Fang?\\nOleg : I bring an invitation from my master, Nergal. \"Return the children to\\n   me.\" Seems foolish to deliver the message... After all, I can take them\\n   both myself and go now!\\nEliwood : You\\'ll never take them!!\\n\\nOleg : In defeat... there is only... death. Urgh...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHector : Hey, are you OK?\\nEliwood : Mm. Sorry to worry you.\\nLyn  : You don\\'t have to push yourself so.\\nEliwood : We\\'ll have time for mourning when this is all finished. For now, in\\n   my father\\'s name... I will do everything I can to stop Nergal and protect\\n   our lands.\\nHector : I see. So, what do you have in mind?\\nEliwood : ...We need to see Marquess Ostia.\\nHector : My brother?\\nEliwood : After all we\\'ve learned... We can\\'t not tell him, can we?\\nHector : Sure, I guess...\\nLyn  : Hector? Why that odd expression?\\nEliwood : Hector doesn\\'t want to meet Lord Uther. He\\'s been lax in contacting\\n   him and is afraid to face him, right?\\nHector : What! And how did you expect me to send him any messages when we\\'re\\n   traipsing about the isles like merchants on holiday?\\nEliwood : Ha ha ha! He is going to be so mad!!\\nHector : C\\'mere!\\nLyn  : Ha... They\\'re both in good spirits. ...It\\'s a lot better than giving in\\n   to despair, I suppose.\\n\\nMarcus : Lord Eliwood... Are you feeling better?\\nEliwood : Marcus... I\\'m fine. I know I worried you.\\nMarcus : About Lord Elbert... At my own discretion, I sent a messenger to Lady\\n   Eleanora.\\nEliwood : ...I see. Thank you, Marcus. That was well done.\\nMarcus : ...I thought she should know as soon as possible. The marquess\\'s\\n   final moments were so... very noble.....\\nEliwood : .....\\nIsadora : Lord Eliwood! Commander Marcus!!\\nEliwood : Ah!!\\nMarcus : Is... Is that you, Isadora?!\\nIsadora : I\\'ve finally found you. I\\'m glad you\\'re well...\\nEliwood : Isadora, what are you doing here? Don\\'t tell me something\\'s happened\\n   to Mother...\\nIsadora : No, Lady Eleanora is well. Do not worry. When word of Lord Elbert\\'s\\n   death reached her yesterday... She said not a word... She merely gave her\\n   full attention to the messenger.\\nEliwood : ...Mother.\\nIsadora : Then, she issued me orders without hesitation. She commanded I\\n   deliver this sword to Lord Eliwood and remain at his side.\\nEliwood : But... the castle defenses will be shorthanded.\\nIsadora : Lord Eliwood... please... Understand your mother\\'s feelings. Lord\\n   Elbert is not coming home. All your mother can do now is pray for your\\n   continued safety. \"Obey your father\\'s dying wish.\" That is her message to\\n   you, and I have delivered it.\\nMarcus : Why not petition ostia for reinforcements to help ward Castle Pherae?\\nEliwood : ...Good idea. I guess it would ease my mother\\'s fears and bow to her\\n   wishes.\\nIsadora : It\\'s that thinking that makes you Lord Eliwood.\\nEliwood : Our battles are like nothing you\\'ve ever prepared for. ...Are you\\n   ready to face them, Isadora?\\nIsadora : Yes. I will serve with my very life.\\n\\nEliwood : Agung? Is something wrong? Oh, you were worried about me. I\\n   apologize for all of the trouble. I\\'m fine now. I have my friends to lean\\n   on. Hector, Lyndis, and you, Agung... Thanks to all of you, I\\'m getting\\n   stronger. I am coming to believe that together, we can overcome anything!\\n\\nNergal : Sonia. Limstella.\\nSonia : You called, Lord Nergal?\\nLimstella : .....\\nNergal : My wound... needs time. It was a deep cut, and my strength is not\\n   what it was. The man who did this to me is dead. I\\'d like his son\\'s death\\n   as compensation. Sonia. You will use Brendan to move the Black Fang. I do\\n   not need mere underlings now. I need the Four Fangs.\\nSonia : Hee hee, leave it to me. I\\'ll have them bowing their heads to you, my\\n   Lord.\\nNergal : Limstella. I want you to gather my quintessence. For this injury to\\n   heal, I will need much. You are the strongest of all my morphs. Kill all\\n   those who bear signs of great power.\\nLimstella : As you will...\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.21  CHAPTER TWENTY ONE : KINSHIP\\'S BOND\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood travels westward to meet with Uther, the marquess of Ostia. They pass\\nthrough Laus and continue to through two more territories. After a time, they\\narrive at a fortress separating Thria and Ostia.\\n\\nSonia : Jaffar. Ursula. Lloyd. Linus. That\\'s everyone, is it not? If I\\n   have you, the Four Fangs, together, I need no one else. I have need of you\\n   to eliminate a man whose living plagues me. His name is Eliwood, a noble of\\n   Pherae.\\nJaffar : .....\\nUrsula : ...Pherae\\'s located in Lycia, is it not?\\nSonia : That\\'s right. But he is no simple country lord. He has friends.\\n   Other Lycian lords. Individually, they are no match for you, and yet...\\n   Carelessness invites death.\\nUrsula : Do not made that mistake.\\nSonia : Llyod, Linus... I have work for you, the Reed brothers, as well.\\n   All right?\\nLloyd : One question. Are these our father\\'s ord-- I mean... the orders of the\\n   head of the Black Fang?\\nSonia : Hee hee... Why, naturally. Isn\\'t that right, my beloved?\\nBrendan : Mmm... Ah... yes.\\nSonia : There! Are you satisfied? Remove Eliwood. Your orders come from the\\n   head of the Black Fang, Brendan Reed. As members of this group, you will\\n   follow that order, yes? Or... does your opponent frighten you into\\n   immobility, Lloyd?\\nLinus : Sonia! How dare you speak to my brother in such a...\\nLloyd : Linus.\\nLinus : ...I know.\\nLloyd : Sonia, we do not need to be chastised by you. Under our father, we are\\n   the ones who\\'ve carried out the law of the Fang. If Eliwood is an evil\\n   person, there is no reason for us to hesitate.\\nLinus : The Fang lets none escape.\\nLloyd : We, the brothers Reed, dispense the Fang\\'s justice.\\nSonia : ..... Ursula, Jaffar, you understand your orders, yes? Once you find\\n   the target, you eliminate him at once!\\nUrsula : It will be as you say, Lady Sonia. Anything for you.\\nJaffar : ... I\\'ve received my orders. I will do my duty.\\nSonia : Your target\\'s name is Eliwood, noble of Pherae! Bring him down. On the\\n   Black Fang\\'s honor!\\n\\nOstia\\nHector : ...I\\'ve had word from my brother. He\\'s already on his way here. We\\'re\\n   to wait for him.\\nEliwood : Lord Uther is coming here himself?\\nHector : So it appears. I told you of this before, but Castle Ostia, not to\\n   mention the city itself, is filled with countless foreign spies. I assume\\n   he thinks it will be easier to speak freely here.\\nEliwood : But... wouldn\\'t leaving Ostia generate even more attention?\\nHector : He\\'s traveling in secret with very few attendants. He\\'s skilled at\\n   this sort of thing. There\\'s no need to worry.\\nLyn  : How unconventional. It must run in the family.\\nHector : ...And what exactly is that supposed to mean?\\nLyn  : Nothing. I\\'m very much looking forward to meeting him.\\n\\nNinian : Nils, are you well? You seem... distant.\\nNils : I\\'m fine. Just a little tired. If we can sit still for one night, I\\'ll\\n   be bet...ter...\\nNinian : No! Nils!? Nils!!\\n\\nLyn  : Nils!?\\nHector : Nils! You all right?\\nNinian : Nils!!! Open your eyes!\\nEliwood : Ninian! Calm down!\\nNinian : ...Ah, I.....\\nHector : Let\\'s move him into the back room and call a healer.\\nNinian : You mustn\\'t move him!\\nHector : Huh?\\nLyn  : Ninian?\\nNinian : I\\'m sorry. I... Um... Please, just for now... Don\\'t move him.\\nHector : But...\\nNinian : Please...\\nEliwood : ...Let\\'s do as Ninian says. She must have her reasons.\\nNinian : ...Please, just one night\\'s rest... That should... make things right.\\nHector : If it\\'s going to make him feel better, fine. Whatever you do, don\\'t\\n   move him. I\\'ll let the others know.\\nNinian : Lord Hector... ...My apologies.\\nHector : No worries.\\n\\nEubans : ...So this is where the Pheraen noble and his friends are, eh?\\nHeath : yes, Commander Eubans.\\nEubans : Very well, Heath, your units will attack from west of the fortress.\\n   Your mission is to put an end to the entire group. Make no mistakes.\\nHeath : ...Are you serious? Marquess Laus abandoned us and just vanished.\\n   We\\'ve no reason to engage this group.\\nEubans : We answered Marquess Lau\\'s call, and we will honor our duty.\\n   Regardless, we cannot remain in Lycia any longer. We rebelled against\\n   Ostia, and our entire mercenary force is hunted... If we take their heads,\\n   we can join the Black Fang in Bern.\\nHeath : I\\'m opposed to this plan. There are women and children in their group.\\n   What you would ask of us... It\\'s something no knight... no man could do\\n   without shame.\\nEubans : Listen well, Heath. You\\'re a wanted man, a fugitive from Bern. How\\n   about we take you and hand you over to Bern\\'s wyvern riders? We might even\\n   be knighted as a reward, given honest work.\\nHeath : .....\\nEubans : Hah! Thought as much. Everyone wants to protect his own skin. Now,\\n   get your unit together. We attack!!\\n\\nSoldier : Sir! We\\'re under attack! It\\'s the east gate! The foes is already\\n   inside!\\nHector : Blast! They would show up now.\\nEliwood : We can\\'t move Nils. Let\\'s try and hold them off! Protect Nils! Don\\'t\\n   let them near him!\\n\\nAugury :\\nSomeone is ill... collapsed... This person cannot be moved. ...Illness will\\nnot stay your foe\\'s hand, however... You must protect the fallen. Do not let\\nyour foes in. Mines and light runes can be used to block their path. Ah... I\\nsee a meeting. A sky rider... He carries justice in his heart... He might\\nlisten to one of your leaders.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIsadora : You\\'re Agung, correct? Lord Eliwood has told me much about you. I\\'m\\n   a knight in service to House Pherae. My name is Isadora. I\\'m under your\\n   command. Please instruct me.\\n\\nSoldier : Lord Hector! We\\'ll serve as your reinforcements. We\\'re a small\\n   group, and we\\'ve some mercenaries among us. Rath of Sacae! Take charge of\\n   the mercenaries!\\nRath : ...Understood.\\nSoldier : Hear me!! we\\'re here to protect Lord Hector, Lord Eliwood, and Lady\\n   Lyndis!\\nRath : Lyn...\\n\\nEubans : ...I didn\\'t imagine they were this capable.... Heh! Still, I won\\'t\\n   lose! I live and breathe the air of ar! I can\\'t be beaten!\\n\\nHeath and Eubans :\\nEubans : You are a traitor, Heath. You know nothing of honor!\\nHeath : I... No. I simply must live a life of which I am not ashamed.\\n   Commander Eubans... It is not too late. Give the order to stop. If you\\n   do...\\nEubans : Ha ha... You\\'re so naive! You\\'re no knight. And you\\'re no mercenary,\\n   either, you dolt! You know nothing! You can carry your precious morals\\n   straight to the grave!\\n\\n\\nEubans : No regrets... My life... and death... are my own!\\n\\nSoldier : Commander Eubans has gone down... Uh... Sound the retreat!! We\\'ve no\\n   more reason to fight!!\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUther : So, brother, you\\'re alive after all. You were so long gone that I\\n   feared you dead. Another day, and I might have arranged you a funeral rite.\\nHector : ...My apologies. Been a little busy.\\nUther : yes... Leila\\'s final report covered much. ...Eliwood. I am sorry about\\n   Lord Elbert. I was powerless to help.\\nEliwood : No... Nothing could have been done. ...More importantly, do you know\\n   of Nergal?\\nUther : Only what was reported to me. He appeared a year ago and seized\\n   control of Black Fang. Then he ensnared Laus in a plot of rebellion against\\n   Ostia. I can\\'t see what he\\'s after...\\nEliwood : The dragons that vanished after the Scouring... He wants to... bring\\n   them back again.\\nUther : What!? Can that be done?\\nEliwood : Yes. Let me explain.\\n\\nHector : This has even got my brother brooding. He\\'s always been a firm\\n   believer in quick decisions. Yet he wishes for more time... that\\'s never\\n   happened before.\\nLyn  : ...It\\'s gone from a simple rebellion to a threat to the human race. We\\n   saw it with our own eyes, and yet... It\\'s all so unbelievable.\\nEliwood : Yet... it\\'s all true.\\nHector : Yes. I wonder what will happen next. Ideally, we could bring the\\n   whole of our lands together to fight as one. It would be a return to the\\n   time of the Scouring...\\nEliwood : However, this all hinges on the existence of dragons themselves.\\n   Unless dragon are seen in the skies, I doubt anyone will believe us.\\nLyn  : Right. And once the dragons are here it\\'ll be too late.\\nEliwood : We must stop all of this now. And we\\'re the only ones who know\\n   enough to do it!\\nHector : Right!\\nLyn  : I agree.\\nHector : There we have it! Come on, let\\'s speak to my brother!\\nEliwood : Agung, Ninian. Will you go with us?\\nNinian : Ye-Yes...\\n\\nUther : I would sooner not place this burden on your shoulders alone. And yet,\\n   I can see no other choice before me. Listen, my brother... Eliwood, Lyndis,\\n   are you determined to act on your resolve?\\nEliwood : yes, we\\'re prepared.\\nLyndis : Me, too... I don\\'t care for sitting back, waiting for others to act.\\nUther : And you, Agung. My brother and his friends are in your debt. What role\\n   will you play? Will you help them? See them through their coming trials?\\n   ...I see. Then I have no more to say. I will aid you as much as I can.\\n   ...Good luck to you all. ...And what of the girl? The one we spoke of\\n   earlier?\\nHector : Oh, Ninian.\\nNinian : It... It\\'s an honor to meet you, Marquess Ostia...\\nHector : Both Ninian and her brother, Nils, possess a special power.\\nUther : Is that so? Then I would ask you. Do you know where Nergal is at this\\n   moment?\\nNinian : Yes, I can sense him... To the east... He is... very far.\\nLyndis : East... Is he targeting Bern next?\\nUther : That bodes ill. Bern is a powerful and militant country. If Nergal\\n   ensnares it... We\\'re done for.\\nNinian : ...There\\'s still time. He is still... very weak... Now... We must\\n   act...\\nLyndis : So, Nergal can\\'t act right away, is that it? Yet, what can we...\\nHector : We\\'ve no choice but to depart for Bern.\\nUther : ...If there\\'s time, make your destination Missur.\\nHector : Missur!? That\\'s the wrong direction!\\nUther : Go to the Nabata desert... You may find aid there.\\nEliwood : What do you mean?\\nUther : Go and meet the living legend.\\nEliwood : Living... legend?\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.22  CHAPTER TWENTY TWO : LIVING LEGEND\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Nabata Desert. A wasteland of scorching sun and frigid nights. It rejects\\nhuman life. Any careless enough to enter its embrace is doomed to wander lost.\\nUther,the marquess of Ostia, spoke of a living legend. Guided by his words,\\nEliwood heads straight into the desert.\\n\\nNils : ...So hot. I\\'m... going to die.\\nHector : Hey, do you want me to carry you on my back?\\nNils : Huh?\\nHector : Why are you looking at me like that?\\nNils : Such kindness from you surprised me, Lord Hector. Is this some fever\\n   dream?\\nHector : What\\'s that supposed to mean? I was concerned that you might collapse\\n   again, like the other day.\\nLyndis : You\\'re usually so brusque. It\\'s no wonder he\\'s confused. Don\\'t be\\n   shy, Nils. Let him help you out.\\nNils : ...But...\\nHector : Do as you\\'re told, boy!\\nNils : Waaa!! Waaaaaaa!!! I\\'m going to fall! I\\'m going to fall!!!\\n\\nNinian : ...Marquess Ostia said, \"Enter the desert and move west. Someone will\\n   meet you.\" ...And yet we\\'ve seen no one.\\nEliwood : I wonder if we need to move farther in?\\nNinian : ...You might be right.\\nEliwood : Here.\\nNinian : What?\\nEliwood : This heat is taking its toll on you. If you please, take my arm.\\nNinian : I couldn\\'t...\\nEliwood : Oh, come now.\\nNinian : ...Very well. Forgive me... .....\\nEliwood : Hm? Is something wrong?\\nNinian : ...It\\'s strange.\\nEliwood : What is?\\nNinian : All of you treat my brother and me so... normally. Doesn\\'t it bother\\n   you? Our powers... our looks... We\\'re different from... people...\\nEliwood : Has that been bothering you? What\\'s wrong with being a bit different\\n   from other people? When I look at you, I don\\'t see other people. I see\\n   Ninian. I see a normal, kindhearted girl.\\nNinian : Do you speak truly?\\nEliwood : Mm.\\nNinian : Lord Eliwood.\\n\\nAthos : ...I believe someone approaches.\\nLouise : Is it Lord Pent?\\nAthos : No, it\\'s a group sent by Uther of Ostia. Hawkeye will find them soon\\n   and bring them here. Hmph,. Your companion is still searching in the\\n   dessert.\\nLouise : He\\'s not having any luck finding what he\\'s after, is he?\\nAthos : No. I believe he\\'ll find it before long. ...However, a group of bandit\\n   is also moving. They\\'ve found Pent and are preparing to attack.\\nLouise : Oh, that\\'s...\\nAthos : Are you concerned for his safety?\\nLouise : No, Lord Pent can take care of himself. However, if his return here\\n   is delayed...\\nAthos : Yes?\\nLouise : Will you take your evening meal without us? I will wait for Lord\\n   Pent, but I\\'m sure you must be hungry.\\nAthos : Ha ha ha ha...\\nLouise : Lord Athos? What is it?\\nAthos : ...It\\'s you, Louise. You are a most amusing woman. Since Pent brought\\n   you here, I feel I\\'ve laughed enough for ten years! You have my gratitude.\\nLouise : Hm? I\\'m not sure I understand, but I\\'m pleased to have been of\\n   service.\\nAthos : Ha ha ha.\\nLouise : By the way, the visitors are coming from Lycia, aren\\'t they? I wonder\\n   what they want.\\nAthos : .....\\nLouise : Lord Archsage, your coloring... Are you well?\\nAthos : Once it begins to turn, none can halt the wheel of fate. But as long\\n   as there is hope, people continue to try. ...They do not know the despair\\n   that awaits...\\nLouise : .....\\n\\nNinian : Um, Lord Eliwood?\\nEliwood : Ninian?\\nNinian : Over there... Someone is under attack.\\nEliwood : Are you sure?\\nHector : Ah! That must be him!\\nEliwood : Looks like... a lone man and a crowd of bandits.\\nLyndis : Let\\'s help him! I dislike seeing someone facing overwhelming odds!\\nHector : Hold on, Lyn! I\\'m going with you!\\nEliwood : Hey, you two!\\nNils : Where do they get all that energy? Unbelievable.\\nNinian : ...What will you do?\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go! Have to keep up with one\\'s friends, right?\\n\\nPaul : Oh, look at this kindly soul, Jasmine! He\\'s waiting all by himself to\\n   give us his treasure!\\nJasmine : Oho, Paul! I do believe you\\'re right! Such generosity!!\\nPent : ...It\\'s taken me many days to find this. I\\'ve worked too hard to hand\\n   this over to you thugs.\\nJasmine : So rude! And to think we were going to let you live...\\nPaul : We\\'re fragile creatures! You can\\'t trifle with our emotions so! You\\'re\\n   a bad man! He\\'s so bad, Jasmine!\\nJasmine : Oh, Paul. I know it. I really do. My heart, it is breaking.\\nPaul : What? You, too, Jasmine?\\nJasmine : And you as well, Paul?\\nPaul : Let\\'s go! We must convince him to reconsider!\\nPent : ...I\\'ve no wish to hurt you...\\n\\nAugury :\\nSand, sand, and more sand, as far as the eye can see. Those on horseback will\\nbe slowed. You should take flyers... especially pegasus knights. Magic will\\ntip the scales in your favor. Mages, monks, shamans... Bolster your strength\\nwith these.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCanas : Actually, this is quite fascinating. Agung, the Nabata wasteland is a\\n   bit of a paradise to magic adepts. Stories tell of the many magical\\n   artifacts lost in these sands. I\\'ll keep my eyes open. Of course, I\\'ll be\\n   fighting as well.\\n\\nVillage (13,3)\\nFa : You know what? I\\'m watching the house all by myself. Do you know how to\\n   do that? You have to sit and be good. So that\\'s why I\\'m here. What are all\\n   of you guys doing? Are you hunting for treasure, like that other guy? Let\\n   me tell you a secret. There\\'s something good buried near the bones. I know\\n   stuff like that.\\n\\nJasmine : I got hit, but it feels gooood... These people are too strong,\\n   Paul...\\n\\nPaul : I can\\'t believe we lost, Brother... Aaah... It\\'s a tragedy, Jasmine.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPent : You really helped me out. Thank you.\\nEliwood : We couldn\\'t watch such a lopsided battle. That\\'s all.\\nPent : So why have you come to this wasteland?\\nEliwood : Well... We were told to come here and meet a \"living legend.\"\\nPent : \"Living legend\"? Ha ha ha! I see. That\\'s well said.\\nLyn  : But do you know what it means?\\nPent : Yes, I suppose I do. Looks like we share a common destination. Hawkeye!\\n   You\\'re here, too.\\nHawkeye : Pent, did you find it?\\nPent : That I did. And as I thought, it\\'s spectacular.\\nHawkeye : It\\'s getting dark. Let\\'s go back.\\nPent : Yes, let\\'s make haste. Desert nights are treacherous.\\nEliwood : Oh... OK.\\n\\nAccept Side Quest ?\\n   Yes   No\\n\\nChoose Yes :\\nHector : I don\\'t mind going with you, but how far do we have to walk? No\\n   matter how far we go, there\\'s just more sand... Whoa!?\\nLyn  : Hector? What is... it... Hect... Kyaa!\\nEliwood : Hector? Lyndis? Where did those two... Hnh? What in blazes!? I\\'m...\\n   I\\'m sinking into the sand!\\n\\nChoose No :\\nGo to Chapter 23 : Four-Fanged Offense\\n\\nHawkeye : ...I\\'ve brought them.\\nAthos : Welcome, children of Roland.\\nHector : We\\'ve come from Lycia, old man. Do you understand?\\nLyn  : What do you mean?\\nEliwood : I think I know. Thousands of years ago, man and dragon fought on\\n   this continent.\\nLyn  : Yes, mankind won, and the dragons fled this world.\\nEliwood : That\\'s correct. Man against dragon... The war that we know as the\\n   Scouring. And you know of the Eight Legends, the heroes who led man to\\n   victory?\\nLyn  : Yes, we\\'ve all heard the stories of the Eight Legends. I was raised in\\n   Sacae, so I know of Hanon, the horseman.\\nHector : Sacae is where Hanon was born. Our country, Lycia, was founded by the\\n   hero Roland.\\nLyn  : That\\'s why you called us \"children of Roland\", right?\\nAthos : That is correct, daughter of Hanon and Roland.\\nEliwood : Who are you?\\nAthos : I am Athos. Many choose simply to call me Archsage.\\nEliwood : Athos?! It can\\'t be...\\nLyn  : Huh? What?!\\nHector : Archsage Athos was one of the Eight Legends. If you were really him,\\n   old man... you\\'d have to be over a thousand years old.\\nAthos : The world is full of mysteries. Solve one, and along comes another...\\n   Before i knew it, I\\'d grown distant from my fellow man. Hunger... It knows\\n   no bounds.\\nLyn  : A thousand years... That\\'s a long time.\\nEliwood : Yet thanks to such longevity, we\\'re meeting here today.\\nHector : \"Living legend\"... Now I see it.\\nAthos : You\\'re here because you want to stop Nergal, aren\\'t you?\\nEliwood : Yes. Did you receive word from Marquess Ostia?\\nAthos : No... I am aware of most things that occur in the continent. However,\\n   knowledge is not enough for me to prevent disaster.\\nLyn  : Nils said something similar to that before. \"With my special power, I\\n   can sense danger coming, but I can\\'t do anything to stop it.\"\\nAthos : Nils... One of the children of destiny.\\nLyn  : He\\'s here with us, but something outside caught his attention.\\nAthos : ...I\\'m sure something stopped him...\\nEliwood : Hm?\\nAthos : Let\\'s talk about Nergal. How do we stop him?\\nEliwood : Yes, what can you tell us? What wisdom can you share?\\nAthos : Mm. Your foe is, like me, no longer... altogether human. It will be\\n   difficult to slay him through traditional means. He wields a terrrible\\n   power. His endless strength stems from an ancient, forbidden magic... To\\n   defeat him, you will need a suitable response.\\nEliwood : Response?\\nAthos : ...While he is resting, you must find the power the oppose him.\\nEliwood : Tell us what it is! We\\'ll do anything!!\\nAthos : it will be harder than you can imagine. Great trials await you. ...As\\n   does great despair. You may regret your decision. Will you stay the course,\\n   children?\\nEliwood : ...Our will remains fixed. This is a road from which you cannot\\n   turn back.\\nHector : We\\'ve known that all along!\\nLyn  : We can overcome anything. You\\'ll see. Together, we are strong.\\nAthos : ...Very well. Let me tell you what you must do.\\n\\nAthos : Have you understood all that you have heard?\\nEliwood : Yes. We are to seek out the Shrine of Seals in Bern, right?\\nAthos : Take Hawkeye with you. Add his skills to your own.\\nEliwood : Thank you.\\nAthos : ...And you? What will you do, Pent and Louise?\\nPent : Nergal, a magic user who rivals you, Lord Athos... And the return of\\n   the dragons. An intriguing story.\\nEliwood : ...\\nPent : Forgive the late introductions. I am Pent, Count Reglay of Etruria.\\n   This is Louise, my wife.\\nLouise : It\\'s nice to meet you.\\nEliwood : Count Reglay? You are Count Reglay?\\nLyn  : Who? Is he someone special?\\nHector : Yes. He hails from the most prominent noble house in Etruria. He\\'s\\n   known as the Magic General. what has brought you to this place?\\nAthos : Bern\\'s successor will soon have his coming-of-age ceremony. Pent and\\n   Louise are to attend as representatives of Etruria. Pent claimed there was\\n   time to search the desert for a magic artifact said to have been lost in\\n   the sands here long ago. You arrived shortly after we did. Perhaps\\n   something was guiding you.\\nPent : Bowing to the dictates of fate, my wife and I would like to join you\\n   if we may.\\nLyn  : Well, of course. That\\'s fine, right, Eliwood? Will you send word of\\n   your mission to your countrymen?\\nPent : There\\'s no reason to, and if we did, who would believe us? Besides, it\\n   is not unusual for us to remain absent for long periods. I doubt anyone\\n   will be surprised by our absence. Right, my dear?\\nLouise : Tee hee. You\\'re right, my love.\\nEliwood : Not unlike a certain you noble we\\'ve heard of...\\nHector : That\\'s great! Thanks a lot!\\nEliwood : In any event, we welcome you both with all our hearts.\\nPent : Thank you.\\nAthos : ...There\\'s not much time. I\\'ll send you to Lycia. Hawkeye! Gather\\n   everyone here in the plaza.\\nAthos : You are Agung, correct? Fate blows a strange wind in your direction.\\n   Much rides on our shoulders and in your abilities. I want you to take this.\\n   It enhances natural abilities, skills with which one was born. Give this\\n   to whoever you feel will benefit the most. Do not waste its powers holding\\n   on to it. Use it.\\n\\nGot an Afa\\'s Drops.\\n\\nHawkeye : Everyone is here.\\nAthos : Thank you. Eliwood, your territory is the closest to Bern, is it not?\\nEliwood : Yes. The border lies in the mountains.\\nAthos : Very good. Now please envision a nice, wide place in Pherae... Next,\\n   think of the name of a person you might meet there.\\nEliwood : As you say. ... ...\\nAthos : Now, children of Roland, it is time to says farewell. You must reach\\n   the Shrine of Seals. There, your destinies\\' doors will open wide before\\n   you.\\n\\nPherae\\nEleanora : My beloved. I cannot believe you are gone. Every time I close my\\n   eyes, I see you at my side. Your memory haunts me, and I am filled with\\n   sorrow. ...Elbert... If by some chance you can hear my prayer... Please\\n   look after our son.\\nEliwood : Mother...\\nEleanora : What!? Eliwood? Where-- Where are you?\\nEliwood : Mother! I\\'m home! I\\'ve returned!\\nEleanora : Ah!! Eliwood! Is it really you? Oh, how did you... You startled me\\n   so!\\nEliwood : Forgive me, Mother. The Archsage sent us.\\nEleanora : You look so tired. ...Have you lost weight? Oh, come closer and let\\n   me see your face.\\nEliwood : ...Mother, about Father...\\nEleanora : I heard his last moments were glorious. Though he\\'s gone, he will\\n   ever be my life\\'s joy.\\nEliwood : I know.\\nEleanora : Come... Let us make everyone comfortable. You all look in need of a\\n   rest.\\nEliwood : I\\'m sorry, Mother. We must hurry onward...\\nEleanora : I know that! But for one night... here in the castle... Eliwood...\\n   just for tonight.\\nEliwood : Mother...\\nHector : One night\\'s not going to hurt us. Who knows when we\\'ll be back this\\n   way?\\nLyn  : Yes, let\\'s do it. I am so exhausted.\\nEliwood : Hector, Lyn... Thank you.\\n\\nEliwood : Hello, Agung. So you\\'re still awake. Agung, do you know Bern well?\\n   No, nor do I... Nothing more than I\\'ve heard at the court. I\\'m sure that,\\n   with all of your travels, you know more than I. By the way, Agung, where\\n   were you born? Before you met Lyndis in Sacae, where were you? If it\\'s\\n   difficult to speak about, you needn\\'t worry. It\\'s just that we\\'ve been\\n   together for so long, and I really know almost nothing about you. If you\\n   don\\'t mind won\\'t you tell me about yourself? I would like to learn more\\n   about you and your life.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.22X CHAPTER TWENTY TWO EXTRA : GENESIS\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : Oof... A rock wall? ... Where am I? ...Where is everyone?\\nPent : Hello. You\\'re awake! Are you well?\\nEliwood : ...You\\'re... from before...\\nPent : Hawkeye\\'s friend.\\nHawkeye : .....\\nEliwood : Um... Hawkeye? What is this place?\\nHawkeye : ...I don\\'t know.\\nPent : Eh? You don\\'t know? I would never have imagined a place such a this\\n   existed.\\nHawkeye : My master never spoke of anything like this.\\nNils : Ah! Lord Eliwood! I\\'m so glad I found you.\\nEliwood : Nils! Is everyone all right?\\nNils : Yes, they\\'re nearby. I can\\'t see them, but... I can sense them. So they\\n   must be OK.\\nEliwood : That\\'s good.\\nNils : Do you know where we are? I wonder how we get out of here...\\nEliwood : I\\'d like to know, too.\\nPent : ...Something strange is here. I can feel it in the air.\\nNils : Yes! You\\'re right. It\\'s strange. Unsettling!\\nEliwood : This disquieting feeling... I know it... I\\'ve felt it before. Back\\n   on Valor.\\nNils : On the Dread Isle?\\nEliwood : Yes, we first felt it in those ruins near the Dragon\\'s Gate. That\\n   was right before all our magics failed us.\\nHawkeye : Pent, doesn\\'t that sound like...\\nPent : ...Like a magic seal.\\nEliwood : What\\'s that?\\nPent : I\\'m not entirely certain how to explain it. It\\'s... someone whose very\\n   presence nullifies all magic.\\nEliwood : Why would this person be here? Why now?\\nPent : I have no idea. All I know is that we\\'re being watched.\\nNils : Uh-oh! Something\\'s happening!\\n\\nNils : Heâ€¦ He\\'s called some friends. They are... very powerful.\\nPent : He summoned them here? I\\'m beginning to suspect the magic seal created\\n   this place.\\nHawkeye : If we kill him, can we get out of here?\\nPent : Perhaps.\\nEliwood : Then we fight! If they have strength, then we\\'ll match their\\n   strength and challenge them! We don\\'t have time for this!!\\nHawkeye : I will fight, too. Pent, you stay here and guard the others.\\nPent : Understood.\\nHawkeye : Select those who will go with us. ...And choose carefully.\\n\\n\\nAugury (first time Nils do it, and it is FREE!)\\nHannah : Oh, it\\'s you, Agung. You have good timing. I need to talk with you.\\n   I\\'m old... and I\\'m weary. You all fight so much. Day in, day out... A magic\\n   island one day, a burning desert the next... I\\'m worn out. Exhausted. .....\\n   Truth be told... It\\'s too much for me. I\\'m a simple fortune-teller. These\\n   battles are too muchâ€¦ .....I can\\'t take anymore. Hm? Ah... Don\\'t worry\\n   about the auguries. I\\'ve arranged for someone to take my place. Take care\\n   of yourself. I\\'ll pray for your success.\\nHannah leaves. Nils appears.\\nNils : I\\'ve seen this before... There\\'s someone who can block magic. Use this\\n  to your advantage, and you may well win. This will be a vicious battle. Take\\n  only your strongest. Take your most powerful weapons as well. Dont\\' try to\\n  match blades with the enemy, though. Pick your spot, and let them come to \\n  you one at a time. ...That\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEliwood : All right! Are you ready, everyone? Try not to get separated.\\nHawkeye : ...Don\\'t move!\\n\\nEliwood : Ah! ...The wall!\\nHawkeye : ...He\\'s responsible. He\\'s watching us from somewhere.\\nEliwood : .....\\n\\nHawkeye : Agung, is it? I must see you all safely back to my master. If you\\n   have need of it, I will lend you my strength.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPent : The air... It\\'s returned to normal! The magic seal has fled.\\nEliwood : What in the name of all that is decent is that? It has human form,\\n   but it\\'s... It\\'s not human!\\nPent : .....\\nHawkeye : .....\\nNinian : ...That was a creature of heresy. Its existence makes a ruin of\\n   nature\\'s most basic laws.\\nEliwood : Ninian?\\nNinian : ...Ah, Lord Eliwood. I...\\nPent : ...In this world, there are many mysterious things that fall beyond our\\n   realm of understanding. Come, let us leave this place. A living legend\\n   awaits us.\\nEliwood : Ah... Yes!\\nNinian : .....\\nHawkeye : ...Daughter of...\\nNinian : ...Hm?\\nHawkeye : ..... Be strong...\\nNinian : .....Ah...\\n\\nHawkeye : ...I\\'ve brought them.\\nAthos : Welcome, children of Roland.\\nHector : We\\'ve come from Lycia, old man. Do you understand?\\nLyn  : What do you mean?\\nEliwood : I think I know. Thousands of years ago, man and dragon fought on\\n   this continent.\\nLyn  : Yes, mankind won, and the dragons fled this world.\\nEliwood : That\\'s correct. Man against dragon... The war that we know as the\\n   Scouring. And you know of the Eight Legends, the heroes who led man to\\n   victory?\\nLyn  : Yes, we\\'ve all heard the stories of the Eight Legends. I was raised in\\n   Sacae, so I know of Hanon, the horseman.\\nHector : Sacae is where Hanon was born. Our country, Lycia, was founded by the\\n   hero Roland.\\nLyn  : That\\'s why you called us \"children of Roland\", right?\\nAthos : That is correct, daughter of Hanon and Roland.\\nEliwood : Who are you?\\nAthos : I am Athos. Many choose simply to call me Archsage.\\nEliwood : Athos?! It can\\'t be...\\nLyn  : Huh? What?!\\nHector : Archsage Athos was one of the Eight Legends. If you were really him,\\n   old man... you\\'d have to be over a thousand years old.\\nAthos : The world is full of mysteries. Solve one, and along comes another...\\n   Before i knew it, I\\'d grown distant from my fellow man. Hunger... It knows\\n   no bounds.\\nLyn  : A thousand years... That\\'s a long time.\\nEliwood : Yet thanks to such longevity, we\\'re meeting here today.\\nHector : \"Living legend\"... Now I see it.\\nAthos : You\\'re here because you want to stop Nergal, aren\\'t you?\\nEliwood : Yes. Did you receive word from Marquess Ostia?\\nAthos : No... I am aware of most things that occur in the continent. However,\\n   knowledge is not enough for me to prevent disaster.\\nLyn  : Nils said something similar to that before. \"With my special power, I\\n   can sense danger coming, but I can\\'t do anything to stop it.\"\\nAthos : Nils... One of the children of destiny.\\nLyn  : He\\'s here with us, but something outside caught his attention.\\nAthos : ...I\\'m sure something stopped him...\\nEliwood : Hm?\\nAthos : Let\\'s talk about Nergal. How do we stop him?\\nEliwood : Yes, what can you tell us? What wisdom can you share?\\nAthos : Mm. Your foe is, like me, no longer... altogether human. It will be\\n   difficult to slay him through traditional means. He wields a terrrible\\n   power. His endless strength stems from an ancient, forbidden magic... To\\n   defeat him, you will need a suitable response.\\nEliwood : Response?\\nAthos : ...While he is resting, you must find the power the oppose him.\\nEliwood : Tell us what it is! We\\'ll do anything!!\\nAthos : it will be harder than you can imagine. Great trials await you. ...As\\n   does great despair. You may regret your decision. Will you stay the course,\\n   children?\\nEliwood : ...Our will remains fixed. This is a road from which you cannot\\n   turn back.\\nHector : We\\'ve known that all along!\\nLyn  : We can overcome anything. You\\'ll see. Together, we are strong.\\nAthos : ...Very well. Let me tell you what you must do.\\n\\nAthos : Have you understood all that you have heard?\\nEliwood : Yes. We are to seek out the Shrine of Seals in Bern, right?\\nAthos : Take Hawkeye with you. Add his skills to your own.\\nEliwood : Thank you.\\nAthos : ...And you? What will you do, Pent and Louise?\\nPent : Nergal, a magic user who rivals you, Lord Athos... And the return of\\n   the dragons. An intriguing story.\\nEliwood : ...\\nPent : Forgive the late introductions. I am Pent, Count Reglay of Etruria.\\n   This is Louise, my wife.\\nLouise : It\\'s nice to meet you.\\nEliwood : Count Reglay? You are Count Reglay?\\nLyn  : Who? Is he someone special?\\nHector : Yes. He hails from the most prominent noble house in Etruria. He\\'s\\n   known as the Magic General. what has brought you to this place?\\nAthos : Bern\\'s successor will soon have his coming-of-age ceremony. Pent and\\n   Louise are to attend as representatives of Etruria. Pent claimed there was\\n   time to search the desert for a magic artifact said to have been lost in\\n   the sands here long ago. You arrived shortly after we did. Perhaps\\n   something was guiding you.\\nPent : Bowing to the dictates of fate, my wife and I would like to join you\\n   if we may.\\nLyn  : Well, of course. That\\'s fine, right, Eliwood? Will you send word of\\n   your mission to your countrymen?\\nPent : There\\'s no reason to, and if we did, who would believe us? Besides, it\\n   is not unusual for us to remain absent for long periods. I doubt anyone\\n   will be surprised by our absence. Right, my dear?\\nLouise : Tee hee. You\\'re right, my love.\\nEliwood : Not unlike a certain you noble we\\'ve heard of...\\nHector : That\\'s great! Thanks a lot!\\nEliwood : In any event, we welcome you both with all our hearts.\\nPent : Thank you.\\nAthos : ...There\\'s not much time. I\\'ll send you to Lycia. Hawkeye! Gather\\n   everyone here in the plaza.\\nAthos : You are Agung, correct? Fate blows a strange wind in your direction.\\n   Much rides on our shoulders and in your abilities. I want you to take this.\\n   It enhances natural abilities, skills with which one was born. Give this\\n   to whoever you feel will benefit the most. Do not waste its powers holding\\n   on to it. Use it.\\n\\nGot an Afa\\'s Drops.\\n\\nHawkeye : Everyone is here.\\nAthos : Thank you. Eliwood, your territory is the closest to Bern, is it not?\\nEliwood : Yes. The border lies in the mountains.\\nAthos : Very good. Now please envision a nice, wide place in Pherae... Next,\\n   think of the name of a person you might meet there.\\nEliwood : As you say. ... ...\\nAthos : Now, children of Roland, it is time to says farewell. You must reach\\n   the Shrine of Seals. There, your destinies\\' doors will open wide before\\n   you.\\n\\nPherae\\nEleanora : My beloved... I cannot believe you are gone. Every time I close my\\n   eyes, I see you at my side. Your memory haunts me, and I am filled with\\n   sorrow. ...Elbert... If by some chance you can hear my prayer... Please\\n   look after our son.\\nEliwood : Mother...\\nEleanora : What!? Eliwood? Where-- Where are you?\\nEliwood : Mother! I\\'m home! I\\'ve returned!\\nEleanora : Ah!! Eliwood! Is it really you? Oh, how did you... You startled me\\n   so!\\nEliwood : Forgive me, Mother. The Archsage sent us.\\nEleanora : You look so tired. ...Have you lost weight? Oh, come closer and let\\n   me see your face.\\nEliwood : ...Mother, about Father...\\nEleanora : I heard his last moments were glorious. Though he\\'s gone, he will\\n   ever be my life\\'s joy.\\nEliwood : I know.\\nEleanora : Come... Let us make everyone comfortable. You all look in need of a\\n   rest.\\nEliwood : I\\'m sorry, Mother. We must hurry onward...\\nEleanora : I know that! But for one night... here in the castle... Eliwood...\\n   just for tonight.\\nEliwood : Mother...\\nHector : One night\\'s not going to hurt us. Who knows when we\\'ll be back this\\n   way?\\nLyn  : Yes, let\\'s do it. I am so exhausted.\\nEliwood : Hector, Lyn... Thank you.\\n\\nEliwood : Hello, Agung. So you\\'re still awake. Agung, do you know Bern well?\\n   No, nor do I... Nothing more than I\\'ve heard at the court. I\\'m sure that,\\n   with all of your travels, you know more than I. By the way, Agung, where\\n   were you born? Before you met Lyndis in Sacae, where were you? If it\\'s\\n   difficult to speak about, you needn\\'t worry. It\\'s just that we\\'ve been\\n   together for so long, and I really know almost nothing about you. If you\\n   don\\'t mind won\\'t you tell me about yourself? I would like to learn more\\n   about you and your life.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.23a  CHAPTER TWENTY THREE : FOUR-FANGED OFFENSE\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHeeding the archsage Athos\\'s advice, Eliwood sets out for Bern.\\nBern: the greatest military force on the continent.

Even in a\\n   remote village like this, they\\'ve heard announcements for the prince\\'s\\n   coming-of-age ceremony.\\nLyn  : Well, Prince Zephiel\\'s ceremony is only ten days away. There\\'s no\\n   helping all the excitement.\\nHector : They\\'ve no idea what\\'s happening. ...Carefree fools.\\nEliwood: ..... Tell me, Hawkeye, do you know the location of the Shrine\\n   of Seals?\\nHawkeye : I\\'ve heard it\\'s north of Bern. But the location of the shrine\\n   itself is secret. I doubt if anyone outside the royal family knows how to\\n   reach it.\\nLyn  : So, if we want to reach the shrine, we\\'ll have to contact the royal\\n   family, is that it?\\nHector : Without revealing our identities or our motives? There\\'s got to be\\n   another way to find where it is.\\nPent : ... I can provide you with its general location.\\nEliwood : Lord Pent?\\nPent : I\\'m privy to the highest secrets of military information in Etruria.\\n   When we learned of the shrine\\'s existence, we investigated. However, none\\n   of our operatives returned. Bern\\'s defenses are formidable.\\nHector : So, even if we reach the shrine, we\\'re as like as not to be\\n   captured?\\nPent : Most likely. And if your identities are discovered, Bern will see it as\\n   an excuse to invade Lycia.\\nEliwood : That, above all else, must be avoided.\\nPent : That\\'s where I come in.\\nEliwood : What do you mean?\\nPent : Duty demands that I attend the post-ceremony festivities. However, I\\n   will greet the queen privately before the ceremony.\\nEliwood : Privately? You can do that?\\nLouise : Queen Hellene was born in Etruria. She and I are related, albeit a\\n   distant relation.\\nPent : When we meet, I will discreetly ask about the Shrine of Seals. Most\\n   like, she\\'ll not say much, but anything will help, will it not? Rest\\n   assured, even if I fail, I will not reveal your presence.\\nEliwood : Lord Pent! That\\'s--\\nPent : If we do not return by tomorrow, return to Lycia and come up with a\\n   new plan. Understood?\\nEliwood : ...If you fail, what will become of you?\\nPent : Everything will work out. It wouldn\\'t be a bad life. Abandoning my\\n   position... Living on the run with Louise...\\nLouise : If I\\'m with you, my lord Pent, I care not where we go.\\nHector : I pray for your success.\\nPent : Please do! Let us proceed, Louise.\\nLyn  : Come back safely! We\\'ll be waiting for you!!\\n\\nHawkeye : ... Pent, hold on.\\nPent : What is it, Hawkeye?\\nHawkeye : I was holding this for the master.\\nPent : It\\'s a ... Heaven seal!\\nHawkeye : Mm... There are only three in existence.\\nPent : What is Archsage Athos\\'s plan?\\nHawkeye : I\\'m to give it to them when the time is right.\\nPent : I see.\\nHawkeye : I...

You and Louise... ..... without fail.\\nPent : ...I understand.\\nLouise : Lord Hawkeye, we... we will most certainly return.\\n\\nLinus : Well, if it isn\\'t Nino.\\nNino : Yeah! Lloyd! Linus! What is it? Are you working?\\nLloyd : I suppose we are.\\nLinus : How about you? Where are you off to in such a hurry?\\nNino : I have a job to do, too! I\\'m carrying messages for Mother, so I have to\\n   do my best! See you! Let\\'s do something when your job is finished.\\nLloyd : She\\'s a good lass.\\nLinus : Yes.

There must be something we can do.\\nHector : I know what you mean, but we have to lay low...\\nLegault : Why don\\'t we try and gather some information on the Black Fang?\\nLyn  : Hm? Information?\\nLegault : Yes. Black Fang\\'s headquarters are here in Bern. The location was\\n   never disclosed to me, though. The Black Fang is so much different than it\\n   once was. Any information we could gain would be beneficial.\\nEliwood : That\\'s a good idea. Thanks, Legault.\\nLegault : Think nothing of it.\\n\\nEliwood : What do you think, Agung? ...You\\'re right. Any information we find\\n   would be a starting place. Then it\\'s settled. Let\\'s get started.\\nEliwood : Let\\'s split up and go. Try to blend in.\\nHector : We\\'d better be careful.\\nLyn  : Especially you, Hector.\\nHector:What!?\\n\\nEliwood : Those two... I can\\'t tell if they\\'re friends or not.\\nNinian : Tee hee...\\nEliwood : Is something funny, Ninian?\\nNinian : It\\'s just... Listen to you grumble, Lord Eliwood!

Come on! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nLloyd : ...Can it really be them? I thought they were in Nabata!\\nLinus : What does it matter where they\\'ve been? We\\'ve found them, so let\\'s\\n   take care of them.\\nLloyd : I guess you\\'re right... Linus, go tell Father what\\'s happening.\\nLinus : Why!? They\\'re right in front of us! You and I can finish this now.\\nLloyd : Moron. It\\'s a precaution. Fangs cannot afford mistakes. Don\\'t worry,\\n   I\\'ve underlings aplenty. I\\'ll taunt the foe and draw them to the fortress\\n   in the north. I doubt I\\'ll lose, but... They\\'ve survived this long, so\\n   they must be tough. I might run into trouble. Deliver your report, then get\\n   back here with reinforcements.\\nLinus : You can\\'t be serious.

It\\'s perfect for taking on evildoers!\\n   Yet here I am again, running errands... I wish I were more worthy,so that I\\n   could help out in battle. Waah! Don\\'t... Don\\'t scrare me like that, Jaffar.\\n   What\\'s wrong? You\\'re never late for anything.\\nJaffar : ...My last job took longer than expected.\\nNino : What? There are things that can slow you down? I would never have\\n   expected that.\\nJaffar : ...If you\\'ve my next mission... let me hear it.\\nNino : Oh, right. Mother gave this to me... Huh? Oh! Wha-What happened? You\\'re\\n   covered in blood!\\nJaffar : ...It\\'s a scratch. Pay it no heed...\\nNino : Scratches don\\'t bleed like that! Let me see.\\nJaffar : Forget it. Next target... hurry... .....\\nNino : Jaffar! Come on, wake... Wake up! What should I do?\\n\\nVillage (2,8)\\nNino : Er... Is there something I can help you with? I have an injured man\\n   here. Please keep your voice down! No, I don\\'t know anything about the\\n   Black Fang! Leave, please! You\\'ll upset my patient!\\n\\nVillage (2,15)\\nNPC  : Tell me, traveler, have you heard of the Four Fangs? The folk of Bern\\n   know all about them. They\\'re the four strongest members of the righteous\\n   Black Fang. The one they call the Mad Dog is a great man. When I was\\n   attacked by bandits, he rescued me. It was night, so I really couldn\\'t see\\n   his face, but... I\\'ve heard some troubling rumors about the Black Fang\\n   lately, though. I wonder what\\'s going on.\\n\\nVillage (4,15)\\nNPC  : Long ago... the lord who ruled this area was an awful man. Every night\\n   he would hold an extravagant feast below the castle. Meanwhile, we\\n   villagers slowly starved to death. One day, though, it ended. The lord was\\n   dead. The Black Fang had given him a death sentence. To us, the Black Fang\\n   were heroes. It matters not what others said. That\\'s what makes it so\\n   hard... Why did they have to change? Helping you... means that I\\'m\\n   betraying the Black Fang. And yet... I want you to have this.\\nGot an Orion\\'s bolt.\\n\\nVillage (2,18)\\nNPC? : ...Stop right there.\\nHeath : Who?\\nNPC? : No need for alarm. For reasons of my own, I wear the gard of the Black\\n   Fang, but I\\'m a loyal citizen of Lycia, and I am not your enemy.\\nHeath : .....\\nNPC? : A woman now leads the Black Fang around by the nose. When at last you\\n   confront her, use this staff. This woman is the ringleader you seek. Her\\n   name is Sonia. Do not forget. Sonia.\\nGot a Silence staff.\\nHalts all enemy magic for several turns, B, MP/2\\n\\nVillage (12,18)\\nSoldier : I will repeat it as often as necessary, Lord Murdock! If we let the\\n   King\\'s tyranny continue, Bern will--\\nMurdock : Hold your tongue.\\nSoldier : But--\\nMurdock : Be still. Is someone there?\\nLyn  : Oh!\\n\\n\\nVillage (25,4)\\nNPC  : Long ago, I used to work in Bern\\'s royal palace. I was Prince Zephiel\\'s\\n   teacher of history. The prince is a wise lad. He\\'s the royal family\\'s first\\n   prodigy. Yet King Desmond ignores the boy\\'s talents, and they wither.\\n   Here... I\\'d like you to take this. This is an Earth seal. This one item\\n   contains the powers of many: Knight crest, Guide ring, Hero crest, Elysian\\n   whip... I am unsure why I would entrust this treasure to a complete\\n   stranger. I cannot explain it, but I have a feeling. For some reason, I\\n   believe you will aid the prince... Strange... Go on!Humor an old man and\\n   take it.\\nGot an Earth Seal.\\n\\nLinus : Pray. I\\'ll give you that much time. All the evil that you\\'ve done up\\n   to now... Repent it, and sleep.\\n\\nLinus & Eliwood\\nLinus : Hey! You\\'re Eliwood, right?\\nEliwood : ...Are you the leader of this group?\\nLinus : I am.\\nEliwood : I\\'ve a question for you... I heard that the Black Fang possessed\\n   strong convictions. If so, then why do you follow a man like Nergal?\\nLinus : ...Nergal? Oh, that eerie man Sonia introduced my father to. This has\\n   nothing to do with him. I merely complete the missions given me!\\nEliwood : And you never question the justness of your missions?\\nLinus : Question? What\\'s to question? Neither my father nor my brother makes\\n   mistakes!\\nEliwood : Yet, the...\\nLinus : Will you stop yammering! I don\\'t need my brother to finish you off. I\\n   will crush you myself, in the name of the Fang!\\nEliwood : Ah!!\\n\\nLinus : Urrg...rr.....\\n\\nEliwood : ...Are you well?\\nLinus : .....I lost. My brother tried to warn me... YOu\\'re strong... Too\\n   strong.\\nEliwood : .....\\nLinus : But... I will not die quit so easily!\\nEliwood : What!?\\nLinus : You\\'ll go with me!!\\nHector : Eliwood!\\nEliwood : ...Do as you must.\\nLinus : Huh!? ...What did you...\\nEliwood : ...I noticed something during the battle. You did your best to keep\\n   the villagers clear of the fighting.\\nLinus : Of course. They\\'ve nothing to do with this. You are our target, not\\n   them.\\nEliwood : You are not evil. The Black Fang fights with honor. So why is it\\n   that we are enemies?\\nLinus : It\\'s your fault! You\\'re evil... .....Bah!\\nEliwood : Huh!?\\nLinus : None of this makes sense! Sonia told Father that you\\'re a band of\\n   criminals. Father agreed, and I obyed, but...\\nEliwood : Sonia? Isn\\'t that...?\\nLinus : ...I\\'m going to withdraw for the moment. I\\'ll be back when this is all\\n   straightened out.\\n\\nHector : That was close.\\nEliwood : Forgive me. I wanted to speak with him at least once.\\nLyn  : Don\\'t worry. It\\'s fine. After all, we learned a little something about\\n   our opponent.\\nEliwood : The Black Fang seems to have some honor after all. Perhaps they\\n   really are just being used by Nergal. We should talk to their head, Brendan\\n   Reed.\\nLyn  : Perhaps we can resolve this without any more fighting.\\nHector : I don\\'t like it. Sounds like a terrible plan.\\nEliwood : Hector?\\nHector : Let\\'s get back to camp. We might have some word from Pent and the\\n   others.\\nLyn  : I wonder what that was all about.\\nEliwood : .....\\n\\nLinus : ...I\\'ve got to talk with my brother... ...I\\'m not sure it\\'s wise to\\n   trust that woman... !! ...Uhh...how...\\nSonia : .....\\nLinus : You... I never felt you... ......nothing.....\\nSonia : ...Mad Dog Linus. Such wonderful quintessence.\\nLinus : .....Curse...s... ...I\\'ve...blun...blundered...

I don\\'t think I told you my name, though.\\n   I\\'m Nino! Sonia\\'s daughter.\\nJaffar : What are you doing?\\nNino : Huh?\\nJaffar : Have you forgotten the law of the Fang? \"Sacrifice the wounded to\\n   salvage the strong\"\\nNino : That\\'s not...\\nJaffar : I was unconscious and alone outside of our safe halls. You should\\n   have obeyed the law... Killed me, and then fled. Yet you didn\\'t. Why?\\nNino : Bu-But... Letting a comrade die? I... couldn\\'t do that.\\nJaffar : Don\\'t be a fool!\\nNino : Sniff...\\nJaffar : ...Tsskk...\\nNino : Don\\'t move! Here! Lean on me!\\nJaffar : ...Don\\'t... touch...\\nNino : Please, don\\'t move. So much blood... You\\'re bleeding again. What do I\\n   do? It won\\'t stop.\\nJaffar : .....\\nNino : Please... don\\'t die. You mustn\\'t die.\\n\\nLloyd : ........ Linus... You fool, after all I told you... ..... ...Wait for\\n   me. I\\'ll be joining you soon enough. And I\\'ll bring you their corpses as a\\n   gift.\\n\\nSoldier : Your Royal Highness, His Majesty the king has arrived.\\nDesmond : Where\\'s Zephiel?\\nHellene : Your Majesty... \\'Tis a pleasure to see you. What a glorious day that\\n   sees you grace us with your presence.\\nDesmond : ...Enough. Call the boy!\\nHellene : Your son is practicing his falconry.\\nDesmond : You knew I was coming, and yet you sent him away. Hmph... As crafty\\n   as ever, woman. Very well, you will have to do. It\\'s ten days until the\\n   boy\\'s coming-of-age ceremony. I would speak of it.\\nHellene : At last... Once the ceremony ends, our son, so long lingering in the\\n   shadows, will be received by all as the legitimate heir to your throne. Do\\n   you know he has longed for this day?\\nDesmond : Cease your complaints. You and Zephiel, queen and heir of Bern, have\\n   never wanted for anything.\\nHellene : We are here in this manse, while you live in the palace with... that\\n   woman. You must be so disappointed that she bore you not a prince but a\\n   princess.\\nDesmond : Hellene! You go to far!!\\nHellene : My child, who through me carries the noble blood of Etruria in his\\n   veins, will in ten days be named as the right-born heir to the throne. Ha\\n   ha ha! No matter how you may dote on her, your illegitimate daughter,\\n   Guinivere, is destined to be nothing more than a baseborn shadow... It is\\n   my son who shall reign in Bern! My son, Zephiel! Ha ha ha ha ha! How it\\n   gives me such pleasure to say those words!\\nDesmond : Have you said your mind? Well, I have something for you to hear as\\n   well.\\nHellene : What could it be?\\nDesmond : Last night, from the palace, the Fire Emblem was stolen away by some\\n   villain.\\nHellene : It can\\'t be! ...Ha ha ha. You are so wicked, Your Majesty. Pray\\n   tell, who would believe such a tale?\\tThe Fire Emblem is Bern\\'s greatest\\n   national treasure. No gem in existence is its equal. Stealing such a\\n   heavily guarded object is impossible, is it not?\\nDesmond : Unfortunately, I speak true.\\nHellene : No...\\nDesmond : You know of the importance of the Fire Emblem. It\\'s the symbol of\\n   the heir, the heart of the ceremony. Without the Emblem, the ceremony must\\n   be canceled.\\nHellene : No!! Thi-This was your doing, wasn\\'t it? How can you despise\\n   Zephiel so? He is of your blood. He is your beloved son, is he not?\\nDesmond : I have heard that Zephiel is... a gifted student, a stunning\\n   fighter, excelling in all he tries. And I\\'ve also heard that he is much\\n   loved by the people.\\nHellene : Yes! It is true. All of it! He is a worthy son.\\nDesmond : I... excelled at neither books nor blades.\\nHellene : What do you--\\nDesmond : I cannot say that I command the love of my subjects... Zephiel and I\\n   are opposites in every way. It is hard to believe that he is my son.\\nHellene : Zephiel is Your Majesty\\'s child! Your Grace, you know this is truth!\\nDesmond : Mine or not, without the ceremony... He will not be named heir. Mark\\n   my words, and prepare yourself, woman.\\nHellene : Your Majesty! King Desmond!! Please... Please wait! He is your heir!\\n   Your son! Please... What am I to do? Zephiel...\\n\\nSoldier : I beg your pardon, Your Highness. You have a visitor...\\nHellene : I will see no one. Send him home.\\nSoldier : Your Highness, I...\\nLouise : It\\'s all right. You may go. I will take care of this.\\nSoldier : Yes, my lady.\\nHellene : Who?\\nLouise : Lady Hellene, it\\'s been far too long. It is I, Louise.\\nHellene : Louise? Is it truly you? Ah... Louise...\\nLouise : What is it? Your eyes are so red. It\\'s a shame to see such beauty\\n   marred by tears.\\nHellene : There is something... I...\\nLouise : If it please you, I would hear your troubles. My husband is here\\n   with me. Perhaps he will be able to lend you his aid.\\nHellene : Lord Pent is also here? I see... ..... ...To be honest...\\n\\nEliwood : Lord Pent! Lady Louise!!\\nPent : Sorry to have kept you waiting.\\nEliwood : ...How did everything go?\\nPent : ...I can\\'t say it was a complete failure, yet...\\nLyn  : What do you mean?\\nLouise : We\\'ve a task to perform.\\nHector : What do you mean?\\nPent : Queen Hellene is looking for something. If we find it for her...\\nEliwood : She will listen to our request, is that it?\\nPent : We have until the morning of the tenth day from today. ...What will you\\n   do? The decision is yours.\\nEliwood : ...We\\'ll do it. It is most certainly a test we were destined to\\n   take.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n  4.24  CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR : UNFULFILLED HEART\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Bern royal family is a pageant of power, love, and hate. Eliwood find\\nhimself embroiled in their troubles. He has been sent to recover the Bern\\nfamily treasure : the Fire Emblem. It has been stolen from the palace vault.\\nEliwood enters the royal palace seeking clues.\\n\\nHector : We\\'ve finally arrived. I can\\'t believe they built a palace in these\\n   mountains.\\nEliwood : Bern is the only country on the continent where wyverns still fly.\\n   With its wyvern riders, I imagine this castle is the best-defended\\n   anywhere.\\nLyn  : I agree. Look at the path leading up the mountain\\'s face. It would be\\n   impossible to scale that in a direct assault.\\nHector : Defenders positioned higher up would have a clear advantage. Even the\\n   best soldiers would be taken out with ease. Hm... Look at that. They don\\'t\\n   have any sentries posted. They must have a lot of faith in their defences.\\nEliwood : Look at these surroundings! They probably make do simply with\\n   patrols within the castle. The might Bern. I\\'d not like it as an enemy.\\nLyn  : And yet, from this impregnable fortress, a treasure was stolen. Perhaps\\n   the king really is responsible for all this. It\\'s hard to imagine any thief\\n   cracking Bern\\'s defenses.\\nEliwood : You\\'re right. But I can\\'t imagine why the king would do this. To\\n   find the Fire Emblem, we\\'re going to need clues.\\nLyn  : Listen, why don\\'t we try sneaking into the castle?\\nHector : That\\'s what I was waiting for! I like the way you think.\\nEliwood : Whatever happens, we must not be caught. If it looks impossible,\\n   turn around and come back here.\\nHector : Got it!\\nLyn  : Of course!\\n\\nLyn  : This is... An inner garden?\\nEliwood : Shh! Someone\\'s coming this way.\\nHector : Here! Into this thicket!!\\nGuinivere : Brother! Hello, Zephiel!\\nZephiel : Ah, Guinivere. Have you been well?\\nGuinivere : Uh-huh! I\\'ve been fine. But if you would come and see me every\\n   day, I\\'d be even better! Much, much better!\\nZephiel : Every day? Well, that\\'s an awful lot, but I\\'ll come by as often as\\n   possible. All for you, dear sister.\\nGuinivere : Yippee!\\nDesmond : Guinivere! Guinivere! Where are you, lass?\\nGuinivere : Here I am, Father! Welcome home.\\nDesmond : Ah, there you are. Were you a good girl while I was gone? Come, give\\n   your father a kiss. You\\'re as adorable as ever.\\nZephiel : Well met, Father.\\nDesmond : ...Zephiel. Hmph... You take the same unpleasant tone as your\\n   mother.\\nZephiel : What!? I... I...\\nDesmond : Silence. What brings you to my castle?\\nZephiel : Ah, yes... Murdock.\\nMurdock : Yes, my lord.\\nZephiel : We were hunting the forest earlier. ...We found this and thought\\n   Guinivere might like it.\\nGuinivere : Eeek! A baby fox!? How cute! It\\'s so very cute!! Is it for me?\\n   Really?\\nZephiel : Do you like it?\\nGuinivere : Yes, I do! Thank you. I do love you, Brother!\\nDesmond : ...Guinivere, go play for a while.\\nGuinivere : OK! Come on, let\\'s go! You lovely little fox!\\nDesmond : ...I\\'ve told you to stay away from the castle.\\nZephiel : Yes... I know.. I beg your pardon. I heard that Guinivere was ill\\n   and I was... worried.\\nDesmond : Hah, you mean you came to see if she would die, don\\'t you?\\nZephiel : Father...\\nMurdock : I beg your pardon, Your Majesty, that...\\nDesmond : Hold your tongue, Murdock! Do not forget whom you serve! The king of\\n   Bern!!\\nMurdock : .....\\nZephiel : It\\'s all right, Murdock... Father, I would never want to see\\n   Guinivere harmed in--\\nDesmond : You and your mother think of nothing more than stealing my throne.\\n   You plague me. Return to the manse!\\nZephiel : ...As you wish. I beg your leave... Father.\\nDesmond : ...No matter how i warn him, he comes. Why is it that the very sight\\n   of him tries my patience so? He is truly of my own fleash and blood, yet...\\nSonia : Hee hee hee. It is jealousy, my king.\\nDesmond : Eh? Who\\'s there?\\nSonia : It is I, Sonia.\\nDesmond : You... Well? Is the Emblem safe?\\nSonia : Yes. I have it in my possession. It is all as we planned.\\nDesmond : it is unlikely, but... The queen might attempt to win the Emblem\\n   back. Are you prepared?\\nSonia : I will not fail... It is secreted away within the Black Fang\\'s\\n   fortress.\\nDesmond : Keep it concealed until dusk of the tenth day, then return it to me.\\nSonia : AS you will, Your Grace.\\nDesmond  And what of my other request...\\nSonia : One of the Four Fangs will tend to it. There will be no mistakes.\\n   However, General Murdock, the man protecting the prince... He is young, yet\\n   well respected. Shall we finish him, too?\\nDesmond : ...Murdock... His birth is low. And yet his combat skills have won\\n   him the tile of Wyvern General. It would be a great blow if Bern were to\\n   lose him. I\\'ll tink of something to remove him from Zephiel\\'s side. Will\\n   that do?\\nSonia : Yes. It would be a great help. Wait! .....\\nDesmond : What? What is it?\\nSonia : I... sense someone.\\nDesmond : Where!?\\nGuinivere : Father! Brother! Where are you?!\\nDesmond : Do not worry. It\\'s my daughter.\\nSonia : Of course. Do not forget the Black Fang\\'s role once we are successful.\\nDesmond : of course. Now begone. Quickly.\\nSonia : Farewell.\\nGuinivere : Zephiel! This kit, it... Hm? Where is my brother?\\nDesmond : He had an errand to perform and left.\\nGuinivere : Oh, no! No, no, no! I wanted to play!\\nDesmond : Come, Guinivere. I will play with you.\\nGuinivere : No! I want to play with him, not you! I\\'ll go and call him back.\\n   Here, hold my fox!\\nDesmond : ...... Attend me!!\\nSoldier : Yes, my lord.\\nDesmond : Take this beast and kill it! Do not let Guinivere know what you do.\\nSoldier : Understood.\\nDesmond : ...Zephiel, you knave. Trying to steal my Guinivere\\'s love... ...You\\n   will learn your place!\\n\\nHector : That was close... I was afraid they\\'d catch us.\\nEliwood : This is worse than I\\'d imagined. The Black Fang has already reached\\n   the king.\\nLyn  : Their plans for Lycia failed, and now they\\'re targeting Bern.\\nHector : If a country as powerful as Bern moves, peace knows no hope.\\nEliwood : What Nergal desires is powerful quintessence. Calling dragons\\n   back... Does he wish to embroil the world in chaos? Whatever his plans, he\\n   must be stopped at any cost!\\nHector : Right. Find the Fire Emblem and return it to the queen. We do that,\\n   and she\\'ll point us toward the Shrine of Seals.\\nLyn  : If we go the Black Fang fortress...\\nEliwood : That\\'s our goal. I must meet with everyone and seek out their\\n   fortress.\\n\\nNinian : I wonder if Eliwood and the others are well.\\nNils : Please, Ninian. That\\'s all you\\'ve spoken of since they left. I\\n   understand your concern for Lord Eliwood, but...\\nNinian : Nils! I...\\nNils : You don\\'t have to hide anything from me. But you must not fall in love\\n   with him, you know? We... are different from them.\\nNinian : ...I know. But I cannot... .....I...\\nNils : Ninian! Where are you going?\\nNinian : I need time to think. May I be alone, please?\\nNils : Ninian...\\n\\nHector : We\\'d better hurry and rejoin the others. Oh, no! Look! It\\'s a wyvern\\n   rider!\\nEliwood : She\\'s coming closer... Has she seen us?!\\nLyn  : No, it\\'s not us she\\'s seen. It\\'s... It\\'s Nils!!!\\nEliwood : Let\\'s go! Hector!!\\nHector : OK!\\n\\nNils : Ahh! Who... who are you?\\nVaida : Light green hair, crimson eyes... No mistake. You\\'re one of Lord\\n   Nergal\\'s lost toys. Yes! Found you at last!\\nNils : ...What are you? Why can\\'t I sense you?\\nVaida : What happened to your bodyguards? I heard they were tough. I wanted\\n   to see for myself. Well, you\\'re here, so they can\\'t be too far away, can\\n   they?\\nNils : ...\\nVaida : C\\'mon, boy! Scream! Call your friends to you! I grow weary of waiting.\\n   I am not known for my patience!!!\\nLyn  : I\\'m the one you\\'re looking for! Unhand the boy!\\nVaida : You\\'ve come! I\\'ve been looking forward to this!\\nEliwood : Looking forward... What do you mean?\\nVaida : The chance to crush you! Then hand the children over to Lord Nergal.\\nHector : Nergal? So you\\'re one of his dogs, are you?\\nVaida : ...I\\'ll not be called a dog by you, blackheart! True, we\\'ve a\\n   contract with the Black Fang, but... I am loyal to one master only! He\\n   who sits on the throne of Bern!\\nEliwood : Then why are you in the employ of the Black--\\nVaida : There\\'s been far too much talking. Let\\'s get started, shall we? I\\'ve\\n   long hungered for someone to test my strength against. Make this last\\n   awhile, will you? I want to enjoy this!!\\n\\nVaida : Listen up, everyone! It\\'s playtime! Come on out!! The palace has\\n   promised to stay out of this! Be as wild as you will!!\\n\\nEliwood : Agung! Our allies are hidden here and there to avoid being spotted.\\n   This is not to our advantage. We must gather everyone quickly!!\\n\\n\\nAugury :\\n... The enemy seeks to scatter and destroy you. You must come together...\\nI see... wyvern riders... They cloud the sky... You should take archers, as\\nmany as possible. The leader of the enemy forces... I sense... something.\\nThere is an... energy.\\nIf you are able to avoid the leader, you should do so. Don\\'t move about too\\nmuch. Staying in one place will make the battle easier.\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPent : We\\'ll help, too. Tell us what to do.\\nEliwood : You as well, Lady Louise?\\nLouise : Of course.\\nPent : No need for concern. She is quite skilled with a bow. Those Bern\\n   wyvern riders will be sorry to meet her.\\nLouise : Despite what you may think,I shoot much better than I dance or\\n   sing. I believe I can be of some small assistance.\\nEliwood : I understand. Thank you for your help.\\n\\nPent : ...Now let me give you this. It\\'s from Lord Athos.\\nEliwood : What is it?\\nPent : A Heaven seal... It reveals hidden strengths. It only works for a\\n   select few, but ...\\nEliwood : It has an air of mystery to it.\\nPent : Do you think you can use it?\\nEliwood : ... ... .....No, it won\\'t work for me.\\nPent : Wait for the proper time, and have the other two try it. It might not\\n   work now, but I\\'m sure that you will all be able to use it at some point.\\n   Just keep trying.\\nEliwood : I understand. Thank you very much.\\nGot a Heaven seal.\\n\\nPent : You\\'re Agung, is that right? Please... forget about my title and\\n   standing in my country. You are our tactician, and I will do as you\\n   command. Well then, I hope we\\'ll work well together.\\n\\nUrsula : Oh, my. It\\'s you...\\nBartre : Me?\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nUrsula : That\\'s right. You\\'re with them, right? I know that this isn\\'t what\\n   I\\'m supposed to do, but... I\\'ll not hand glory over to that newcomer,\\n   Vaida... What? Oh, nothing... I\\'m talking to myself. More importantly, I\\n   want to give you this. It\\'s a hammerne staff. It repairs items. It can\\n   make most items like new again. Promise me you\\'ll bring that wyvern-riding\\n   hag down. I\\'ll be seeing you again, I\\'m sure. Hee hee...\\nGot a Hammerne.\\n\\nHector :\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n==============================================================================\\n  5.

With this, my\\n   lance.\\n\\n\\nEliwood and Hawkeye :\\nEliwood : Who are you?\\nHawkeye : I\\'m Hawkeye, defender of this desert.\\nEliwood : Defender? Of a desert?\\nHawkeye : I will drive out the bandits. Guests need not fight.\\nEliwood : Please wait! Guests!?\\n\\n\\nEliwood and Legault :\\nLegault : Well now, a welcome visitor, indeed. I must thank you for coming so\\n  far.\\nEliwood : What!? You\\'re a...\\nLegault : Mmm... To be accurate, I would say a former Black Fang member.\\nEliwood : Black Fang!!\\nLegault : Ha, no! \"Former\" Black Fang. Now I\\'m simply a thief.\\nEliwood : Huh? So you\\'re not my foe, is that what you\\'re saying?\\nLegault : Correct. So let\\'s pretend we never saw each other.\\nEliwood : Hold on!\\nLegault : Hm?\\nEliwood : If you\\'re not my enemy may I ask for your aid?\\nLegault : Me? Help you?\\nEliwood : I want to know about the Black Fang. ...Please.\\nLegault : This is a surprise. Are you really going to battle the Black Fang?\\nEliwood : Yes.\\nLegault : Your enemy is not Brendan Reed, but a horrible man named Nergal.\\nEliwood : Yes, I know this already.\\nLegault : You\\'re quite plucky. I like you! However, I know almost nothing of\\n   the current Black Fang. If you still want my aid...\\nEliwood : I do! Thank you. My name\\'s Eliwood.\\nLegault : I\\'m Legault. I\\'ll help you as long as I feel safe.\\n\\n\\nEliwood and Lyn :\\nEliwood : Lyndis!\\nLyn  : Eliwood?! You made it!\\nEliwood : Florina told us where you were. We\\'re here to help.\\nLyn  : Thank you!\\n\\n\\nErk and Lyn :\\nErk  : Lady Lyndis, please stay back. I\\'ll serve as the advance guard.\\nLyn  : Hm? You... Is that you, Erk?\\nErk  : Yes, my lady. A pleasure to see you.\\nLyn  : Erk, why are you here in Caelin?\\nErk  : For reasons of my own, I\\'ve joined up with Eliwood\\'s company. We\\'re\\n   here to rescue Caelin. Please, Lady Lyndis, would you kindly withdraw?\\nLyn  : My grandfather is in the castle. I\\'m not going to retreat from this\\n   battle!\\nErk  : You might be a noblewoman, but you haven\\'t changed at all. Very well,\\n   at least stay near me. I\\'ll be your escort.\\nLyn  : Thank you, Erk.\\n\\n\\nErk and Serra :\\nSerra : Ohmigosh! It\\'s Erk! It\\'s been SO long! What are you doing here?\\nErk  : Oh... Serra. You\\'re the last person I wanted to see...\\nSerra : Oh, that\\'s so sweet! You wanted to see me again!\\nErk  : ...\\nSerra : Hey, I know! This is perfect. Come with us and lend a hand, Erk.\\nErk  : I beg your pardon?\\nSerra : Come on! I\\'ll even introduce you to Lords Hector and Eliwood! I know\\n   you. You\\'re probably just wandering about without work.\\nErk  : No, Serra. I\\'m afraid I am gainfully employed. However... If you\\'re\\n   fighting Laus... This might work out after all.\\nSerra : What are you babbling about? Make up your mind, will you?\\nErk  : My employer is hiding in a village south of here. If you\\'ll help me\\n   protect her, I\\'ll join up with you.\\n\\n\\nFiora and Florina :\\nFlorina : Sister ? Fiora!\\nFiora : Florina! Why are you here?\\nFlorina : I\\'m here with Lady Lyndis. What are you doing here?\\nFiora : ... I was investigating the Dread Isle for someone.\\nFlorina : By yourself?\\nFiora : No... There were others... a full unit of pegasus knights. We were\\n   attacked...\\nFlorina : You can\\'t mean...\\nFiora : I misjudget our situation. ...All of my knights are dead because of\\n   me... I\\'m a failure.\\nFlorina : That\\'s not true! You\\'re a splendid pegasus knight! I chose this path\\n   because I admired you so! Please... don\\'t do this to yourself!\\nFiora : ...Florina, please don\\'t cry.\\nFlorina : ... ...I\\'m sorry.\\nFiora : No, it\\'s my fault. The pain of being the sole survivor... It had me\\n   trapped. ...Thank you, Florina. I can see clearly now.\\nFlorina : ...Fiora! Come and travel with us! It\\'s better to travel with\\n   friends than to struggle alone.\\nFiora : ...You\\'re right. I hate to admit it, but I can\\'t do everything alone.\\n   Nor can I render my companion\\'s sacrifices moot by going home. Florina,\\n   please introduce me to your commander. I\\'ll see if I can offer my services\\n   for a short while.\\n\\n\\nFlorina and Lyn :\\nLyn  : Florina!\\nFlorina : Lady Lyndis!\\nLyn  : You\\'re unharmed! I\\'m so relieved. Really!\\nFlorina : Was my service at all helpful?\\nLyn  : Of course it was! You saved us! Thank you!\\nFlorina : Tee hee! I\\'ll do even better next time!\\nLyn  : I\\'m counting on it.\\n\\n\\nGuy and Matthew :\\nMatthew : Hold on! I know you! Isn\\'t your name Guy?\\nGuy  : It\\'s-- Is that you, Matthew?\\nMatthew : What a pleasant surprise! How\\'s your swordwork coming?\\nGuy  : You are aware this isn\\'t the best place to be catching up, aren\\'t you?\\n   You and I... We\\'re on opposite sides here.\\nMatthew : What? Are you saying you\\'re going to fight me?\\nGuy  : I... Well, yeah. I\\'m much improved. You can\\'t beat me.\\nMatthew : You\\'re quite a terror, Guy. Well then... Hold on! I think I\\'d prefer\\n   it if you repaid what you owe me.\\nGuy  : Huh?\\nMatthew : Last time I saw you, I gave you food. If I remember correctly, you\\n   said you owed me your life.\\nGuy  : I only said that \\'cause you said you\\'d feed me if I did! I hadn\\'t\\n   eaten in ten days, and you were cooking meat! You... This... This isn\\'t\\n   fair!\\nMatthew : The people of Sacae never lie. Isn\\'t that right, Guy?\\nGuy  : Grrr... Fine! I finally find work, and now I have to throw it away!\\n   This is all your fault!\\n\\n\\nHeath and Hector :\\nHeath : Do you command this group?\\nHector : Who are you to ask?\\nHeath : I\\'m Heath, a wyvern rider with Eubans\\'s mercenaries.\\nHector : In that case, you\\'re my enemy. You\\'re gutsy, aren\\'t you? Prepare\\n   yourself!\\nHeath : Hold, I\\'ve not come to fight you. I wish to surrender to your group.\\nHector : Surrender?\\nHeath : I\\'ve no wish to harm women and children. I\\'m a soldier, but... I\\'m\\n   trying to be human, too.\\nHector : ...You\\'re an odd one. Right, well. We could use all the help we\\n   can get. You\\'ll fight under my command.\\nHeath : Understood.\\n\\n\\nHeath and Lyn :\\nHeath : You\\'re... a woman?\\nLyn  : What!? Underestimate me, and you\\'ll find you die regretting it! Now\\n   come, if you\\'ve the nerve!\\nHeath : Hold, I am not here to fight you. I\\'d sooner surrender.\\nLyn  : Surrender? You\\'re giving up? Why?\\nHeath : I\\'ve no wish to harm women and children.\\nLyn  : ..... I understand. We\\'re no army. I won\\'t hold you prisoner. If you\\n   are not going to fight, go someplace where you\\'ll be safe. However, you\\n   are welcome to join us and fight at our side. We\\'re trying to protect a\\n   sick child traveling with us.\\nHeath : I see... and I will help you protect this child.\\n\\nHeath and Ninian :\\nNinian : Ah...\\nHeath : A girl...This place is dangerous, you should flee quickly.\\nNinian : .....\\nHeath : ...Wait! Do you know the commander of these forces?\\nNinian : Ah... Yes...\\nHeath : Then deliver a message for me, please. I am Heath, a wyvern rider in\\n   Eubans\\'s mercenaries. Tell him I want to join your group. I will fight with\\n   you.\\nNinian : Wait... Why?\\nHeath : I\\'ve no wish to harm women and children.\\n\\nHector and Lyn :\\nLyn  : Are you an ally, too?\\nHector : Yep, that\\'s what it looks like.\\nLyn  : In that case, I have something to tell you.\\nHector : We\\'re a bit busy now. Save it for later.\\nLyn  : What? Hold on! Wait just a minute!\\n\\n\\nLucius and Raven :\\nRaven : Lucius.\\nLucius : Lord Raven! I\\'m so pleased to see you well!\\nRaven : Things have changed. For the time being, we side with Caelin.\\nLucius : That is good... So you\\'ve had a change of heart?\\nRaven : No, I will still have my revenge against House Ostia. The closer you\\n   are to your enemy, the easier it is to strike, right?\\nLucius : Lo-Lord Raven...\\nRaven : Let\\'s go, Lucius.\\nLucius : Yes...\\n\\n\\nLyn and Matthew :\\nLyn  : Hey! You! You\\'re--\\nMatthew : Um... No, I\\'m not. You\\'ve got the wrong fellow... Bye now!\\nLyn  : Stop right there, Matthew!\\nMatthew : Saw right through my disguise, didn\\'t you, Layd Lyndis?\\nLyn  : What are you talking about? How could I not recognize you? You\\'re...\\n   you!\\nMatthew : Yes, but I had to at least try to fool you. Being memorable is not\\n   the best quality for a spy to have.\\nLyn  : Spy? I thought you were a thief?\\nMatthew : Oops!\\nLyn  : What\\'s this about? Come on, tell me!\\nMatthew : I can\\'t... It\\'s a... secret.\\nLyn  : A secret? Would you have your mouth sealed if you spoke it?\\nMatthew : You\\'re very knowledgeable!\\nLyn  : Very well, I\\'ll ask no more questions. If you have any trouble, though,\\n   you can talk to me. I\\'m sure I\\'ll be able to help.\\nMatthew : Ah... Lady Lyndis? I believe that you are the one currently in\\n   trouble. You\\'re either generous to a fault, or... something else\\n   altogether.\\n\\n\\nLyn and Rath :\\nRath : ...So you\\'re being hunted again, are you, Lyn of the Lorca?\\nLyn  : Rath! Rath of the Kutolah! Well met! What are you doing here?\\nRath : ...After we parted company, I\\'ve made my way as a mercenary here.\\nLyn  : I see... You haven\\'t changed at all. It\\'s... good to see you again.\\nRath : ...Do you need my help?\\nLyn  : Are you offering?\\nRath : ...You... If you desire it.\\nLyn  : Yes, please! Lend us your strength! We\\'re... involved in something\\n   terribly dangerous!\\nRath : I see. When this is finished, I will end my service to this place.\\n\\n\\nLyn and Serra :\\nSerra : Ah! Lyn! I\\'m so happy to see you safe!\\nLyn  : Serra! What are you doing in Caelin?\\nSerra : I\\'m with Lord Hector. We\\'ve come to save you!\\nLyn  : Hector?\\nSerra : Oh, come now! Lord Hector! Marquess Ostia\\'s younger brother! He\\'s a\\n   good friend of Lord Eliwood\\'s, by the way.\\nLyn  : Oh... I see. Well, thank you for coming, Serra. I\\'m glad to see you\\n   again.\\nSerra : It\\'s no trouble at all! When a dear friend\\'s in trouble,you have to\\n   help. It\\'s a rule!\\nLyn  : A dear friend?\\nSerra : Don\\'t worry! Social positions never bother me. I know we\\'ll get along\\n   fine, Lyn!\\n\\n\\nSerra and Matthew in Chapter 6 :\\nSerra : I feel something... I feel it!!! Someone\\'s staring at me! It must be\\n   some poor fool who\\'s smitten with me. Alas, my beauty has rendered him\\n   speechless. Ah... I\\'m so cute it\\'s almost criminal!\\nMatthew : What in the world is that woman doing here? I cannot let HER find\\n   the passageway...\\n\\n\\nPriscilla and Raven :\\nRaven : You...\\nPriscilla : Hm?\\nRaven : Can it be?\\nPriscilla : I...\\nRaven : You don\\'t... recognize me. That\\'s not surprising. You were so young\\n   when we were separated.\\nPriscilla : what? Are you... Raymond? My brother, Raymond?\\nRaven : You\\'ve grown, Priscilla...\\nPriscilla : Brother! My brother!!\\nRaven : What are you doing here? It\\'s been ten years since Count Caerleon of\\n   Etruria took you in as his foster daughter...\\nPriscilla : That\\'s right. My adopted father has treated me with much kindness.\\n   But I am of Caelin\\'s House Cornwell by birth. I still remember Father and\\n   Mother. I\\'ve never forgotten them. Or you, Raymond.\\nRaven : ...Priscilla.\\nPriscilla : ... When I heard that House Cornwell was lost... I... I was so\\n   worried about you.\\nRaven : So that\\'s why you left Etruria? You\\'ve come quite a way.\\nPriscilla : Dear friends of mine in Etruria helped me. They provided a young\\n   mage to be my escort. Then we passed through Laus... The marquess learned\\n   of my lineage and refused to let me leave. I would be there still if not\\n   for Lord Eliwood and his companions.\\nRaven : His... companions?\\nPriscilla : Lord Hector, Lady Lyndis... They\\'re all such kind people. I\\'m so\\n   glad I came to Lycia. And now I\\'ve found you...\\nRaven : You\\'ve become friends with... him?\\nPriscilla : Raymond?\\nRaven : ..... I see. Then I will join you.\\nPriscilla : Dear Brother! Will you truly come with us?\\nRaven : I could not refuse my little sister. And besided...\\nPriscilla : What is it?\\nRaven : It\\'s nothing. You\\'re better off not knowing. Tell me, your lineage...\\n   Do Eliwood and his friends know of your heredity?\\nPriscilla : No, we\\'ve never spoken of it.\\nRaven : I see... That is best.\\nPriscilla : Brother?\\nRaven : Priscilla, we must keep our relationship secret. OK?\\nPriscilla : All right... If you say we must...\\nRaven : Another thing, my name is Raven now. Raymond is... a name I\\'ve\\n   discarded.\\nPriscilla : Brother... You have your reasons, don\\'t you? I understand. As long\\n   as we can travel together, I\\'m happy.\\nRaven : .....\\nPriscilla : If we countinue on, we\\'ll be able to see Father and Mother, too!\\nRaven : ...Priscilla... That\\'s.....\\n\\n\\nSain and Caelin Soldiers in Chapter 16 :\\nSain : Rejoice, one and all! Your beloved subcommander is here to rescue you!\\nSoldier : Subcommader! You\\'re unharmed!\\nSain : Are you ready to fight?\\nSoldier : Absolutely, sir!\\nSain : All right!

What\\'s this?\\nErk  : That\\'s the money I received when I was contracted to her. I failed to\\n   see her safely to Ostia.\\nLyn  : I understand.\\nErk  : So... I will take my leave.\\nLyn  : Be careful.\\nErk  : I will.\\n\\nFlorina : Aaaiiieee!!!\\nLyn  : Florina!\\nFlorina : Lyn, I\\'m sorry. I... I can\\'t go on...\\nLyn  : Agung! Take care of her! Get her to safety!\\nFlorina : I\\'m... I\\'m sorry.\\n--------------------------\\nLyn  : Florina, are you feeling better?\\nFlorina : I\\'m sorry to have worried you. I\\'m fine. Look, it was nothing.\\nLyn : Your left arm! Show it to me!\\nFlorina : Ah... Ow!\\nLyn : As I thought! The bone\\'s broken!\\nFlorina : I\\'m sorry...\\nLyn : Florina, why would you lie to me?\\nFlorina : If I can\\'t fight... You\\'ll leave me behind. That\\'s why I...\\nLyn : ... Florina, I could never leave you behind.\\nFlorina : What?\\nLyn : You don\\'t have to fight anymore. I will protect you myself. I want you\\n   by my side when we reach Lycia.\\nFlorina : Oh, Lyn! Thank you!!\\n\\n\\nKent : Ahh! Defeat...\\nLyn  : Kent!\\nKent : Lady Lyndis, Agung. I\\'m no good to you in this condition. My\\n   apologies, but I must withdraw.\\n--------------------------\\nLyn  : Kent! Should you be up?\\nKent : I\\'m fine. Please forgive my earlier behaviour. The injury to my right\\n   leg was more serious than I thought.\\nLyn  : Ah! That\\'s terrible!\\nKent : I apologize for my negligence.\\nLyn  : You should find someplace to heal and rest your wound.\\nKent : No. We must hurry and move forward.\\nLyn  : But--\\nKent : Milady, my goal is to present you to the marquess as quickly as\\n   possible. I\\'m unable to fight, and I may slow you down, but... Please\\n   allow me to continue traveling with you.\\nLyn  : Of course. I understand. We go together. However, you mustn\\'t\\n   overexert yourself. If your injury grows graver, I will force you to\\n   stop and rest!\\nKent : I understand. Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nLyn  : No... It\\'s not... I\\'m sorry, Agung... Everyone... forgive me...\\n\\nMatthew : Ooh! That\\'s it!\\nLyn  : Matthew!\\nMatthew : Lady Lyndis! Agung! I do not not want to slow you down. I\\'ll pull\\n   back for now. Look for me later!\\n--------------------------\\nMatthew : Hey! Over here! You two looking for something?\\nLyn  : Stop fooling around, Matthew. How are your injuries? Agung and I were\\n   worried about you.\\nMatthew : My injuries? Well... that\\'s where we have a problem.\\nLyn  : What? What is it?\\nMatthew : It\\'s my hand. It\\'s been injured pretty badly. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be\\n   of much use...\\nLyn  : Really... It\\'s that bad?\\nMatthew : Unfortunately, yes. That\\'s my only wound, though. But a thief who\\n   can\\'t use his hands? I\\'m fired, right?\\nLyn  : What do you want to do?\\nMatthew : I\\'d like to continue traveling with you. I can be pretty useful\\n   off the battlefield, you know?\\nLyn  : As I thought... You are an odd one.\\nMatthew : Odd?\\nLyn  : You can come with us. \"Useful off the battlefield,\" hm?

It was... a\\n   moment of weakness.\\nLyn  : Oh, but, Sain, you look much better now!\\nSain : Yes. I\\'m almost as good as new!\\nLyn  : That\\'s as may be, but your coloring is still awful.\\nSain : Huh?\\nLyn  : You should find someplace to rest and heal your wounds.\\nSain : No! You must keep moving forward!\\nLyn  : Well, we can\\'t just leave you behind like this!\\nSain : I\\'ll be fine!

You can borrow Erk. I\\'ve paid his fee in advance, so work\\n   him hard.

Are you well?\\nWil  : Well now, I\\'m not completelyâ€¦\\nLyn  : That\\'s an awful wound... Let\\'s stop someplace and rest.\\nWil  : That\\'s not necessary. Just leave me.

I cannot cause you any trouble.\\nLyn  : Listen! Wil, you are a member of Lyndis\\'s Legion! You\\'re one of us. A\\n   part of our family.

What an odd-sounding name... But pay me no mind. It is a good name. I see by your attire that you are a traveler. What brings you to the Sacae Plains? Would you share your story with me? Hm? What was that noise? I'll go see what's happening. Mark, wait here for me.\",\n",
       " \"Lyn  : Oh, no! Bandits! They must have come down from the Bern Mountains! They must be planning on raiding the local villages. I... I have to stop them! If that's all of them, I think I can handle them on my own. You'll be safe in here, Mark! What? You want to help? Well, can you use a weapon? Ah, I see... So you're a strategist by trade? An odd profession, but... Very well. We'll go together!\",\n",

       " 'Lyn  : Good morning, Mark! Are you awake yet? That fight yesterday must have taken a lot out of you. Say, Mark... I want to talk to you about something. You have some experience in the ways of war, I can see. Would you allow me to travel with you?',\n",
       " \"Lyn  : What? You want me to get permission from my parents? My mother and my father... died six months ago. My people --- the Lorca--- they don't... I'm the last of my tribe. Bandits attacked, and... they killed so many people. The tribe was scattered. My father was our chieftain, and I wanted to protect our people. I am so young, and my parent are old- fashioned. They wouldn't follow a woman. No one would follow me.\",\n",

Mark, tell me you'll train me, that you'll let me travel with you! You will? That's wonderful! Thank you! Oh, thank you! We'll be better off working together, I know it. You'll be my master strategist, and I'll be your peerless warrior! We can do it! Right?\",\n",

The marquess was ecstatic to learn he had a granddaughter of 18 years. I remember the smile on his face when he announced that he'd suddenly become a grandfather. The granddaughter's name is Lyndis. This was also the name of the marquess's wife, who passed away at an early age.\",\n",
       " 'Lyn  : Lyndis?',\n",
       " \"Sain : That she should bear this name thawed the marquess's heart. Now, his only wish is to meet his daughter's family at least once. This is why we're here. We didn't know that Lady Madelyn died a few days after sending her letter... We only learned this shortly after we arrived here in Bulgar. But we also learned all was not lost. Her daughter yet lives. We heard that she was living alone on the plains.\",\n",
