# What is Fire Emblem About, Anyway?
## Background
Fire Emblem is a Japanese video game series developed by Intelligent Systems, spanning 16 games over 30 years and selling over seven million copies. There are many polarizing opinions on Fire Emblem, but based on most of the discourse surrounding the game, one of the biggest pleasures of being a fan is complaining about the franchise's direction in nonspecific "recent years". The series is discontinuous, so characters often only exist in one or two games in the franchise. The "Fire Emblem" that supposedly might bind these games together, is not often of importance. By analyzing the scripts from each of the games, I hope to answer two questions: 1) What is Fire Emblem really about? 2) How have the topics of the games changed over time?

## Data
Data will be taken from the game scripts of each of the 16 games. These scripts range in length from something that can be read over the course of the afternoon (Fire Emblem 1) to something that would take over a complete day of continuous reading (Fire Emblem 16). This data is available on fireemblem.fandom.com and www.gamefaqs.com.

## Algorithms
After preprocessing the data, I hope to use LDA on each individual game to see what topics are prominent.
